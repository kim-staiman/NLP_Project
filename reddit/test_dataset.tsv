"Vielle Bourse It's a bit racist like chess games incidentally. The whites start, have the advantage over the blacks, and when you lose, you are not only in check, but check mate. It's scandalous. Furthermore, this game promotes inequality and lack of choice: certain individuals (chess pieces) have much more power than others. A knight will always be a knight. ""Yes but the pawns can be promoted"" you tell me. That's the myth of the social elevator. We dangle the possibility of being promoted in front of the pawns, but in reality how many are going to benefit from it? How many will be sacrificed to defend the royal oligarchy? In the next few days, I will suggest a socially responsible and inclusive version of this game, which will be from now on the only one allowed."	fr

"Cédric Villani - We're not sleeping 24 March 2018. There is above all a complete misunderstanding of your interlocutors regarding the whole problem. They have two major errors of reasoning: 1) The algorithms used are expert systems ('if then else' with all cases hard coded) whereas in reality we have deep learning algorithms trained on millions of cases that make an ""instinctive"" decision - considering my experience based on thousands of cases, I would have to do this here. There will NEVER be a dev in charge of saying ""in this case we kill the baby, but in this case we speed along in the car"" 2) That the world is deterministic. Even thinking super fast, you can not predict how the environment will react. If I slam on the brakes, does the car behind me manage to brake? Is it an independent vehicle, in which case it can react better? What about the reflexes of the people around us? In short, the question will never arise as ""should I kill x or y"", it will always be ""if I do this there is such a risk, if that then there is such other risk"", and these risks cannot to be calculated precisely, it will be simply, as said above, an ""instinctive"" reaction built by the accumulated experience of the software. In short, you're preaching in the desert."	fr

When developing photos could be done without going through film development stores, this increased the independence of the blue photo industries.\\n\\n	ja

"Compiègne: the children deal drugs, the whole family is kicked out of social housing < It's ridiculous. Social housing contains most of the country nowadays due to a lack of alternative solutions. Nonsense. > Your ability to mix blaming a person with his entire family terrifies me, because here again, this is leaning generally deviating very quickly to collective punishment that doesn't solve these problems in the least. As a tenant, you're responsible for the people in your home, and as a parent, you're responsible civilly for your minor children. This has nothing to do with collective punishment. If you're my neighbor and your friends make a mess, I'll come and shout at you. If it happens again, I'll send the cops who will give you fine. Because it's your home, so your responsibility. In life you sometimes have to be responsible for others. Especially if they live under your roof. And especially if you gave birth to them. That's the way things are. > Well, no it isn't. Since it will change nothing with the fact that they're dealing drugs. Even if you blacklisted from your phone, I'm sure they'll still find a way to deal drugs, just somewhere else. For the neighbors, it's net gain. As the mother of the family, she'll perhaps decide to put a little bit of harshness in her kids' heads because in theory, for the moment, this isn't the case. > Shit, I know I shouldn't make the comparison, but this reminds me of a certain dictator with 3 letters. In fact, this reminds you of all the responsible adults you know. The idea that being a parents means being responsible for your children, this is the B-A-BA of parenting. I mean, it's literally the first thing you should know after ""don't forget to give him some food from time to time."" > It's not up to people to monitor what others do around them. When they're your kids? Yes, it is. When they live under your roof? Even more so. No parent doesn't know this, apart perhaps the stupidest of social misfits."	fr

"The origins of CRISPR. The most interesting part, I think, is the following: > CRISPR is not a technological joke, it is the implementation of a natural phenomenon. A Silicon Valley engineer told Jennifer Doudna, ""Give me any problem and I'll invest $10 million and then I'll hire the best team and solve the problem."" Does this apply to CRISPR? Probably not, because, as she explains in the conclusion of her book, this discovery ""was inspired by a research motivated by curiosity towards natural phenomena. The technology that we created did not require 10 to 20 million dollars to develop, but it did require a thorough understanding of the chemistry and biology of adaptive bacterial immunity, a topic that may seem unrelated to gene editing. This is just one example of the importance of basic research - the pursuit of scientific research to understand our natural world - and its relevance to the development of new technologies.” I have already had this debate with fellow researchers. They talk to you about GFP (green fluorescent proteins), taxols (natural yew extracts used in chemo) or CRISPR/CAS9 as examples of discoveries coming from fundamental research that have concrete and important applications. The problem, as I argue each time, is that it’s never the discoverer that had the idea. It’s not Doudna/Charpentier who discovered CRISPR, they are very brilliant European microbiologists, but the idea of a practical application never even crossed their minds. In France, in fundamental research, there is a clear lack of engineers dedicated to the patenting and implementation of discoveries, which would make it possible to effectively fund fundamental research through exploitation licenses for these patents. But tell that to the researchers and most of them immediately climb up on their high horses. “I’m doing science, mister, not business.” All while complaining that their budgets are being reduced because the products of their discoveries are taken over by the private sector."	fr

I'm commenting in a forum. > Reasoning with absurdity is like me telling you that you want to consider terrorists as 100% French because you hate France. That's called a process of intention and it's the worst kind of reflection. I confirm that your example is absurd, the worst kind of reflection and full of personal attacks. > No, because you were given a long text as a reference and you didn't read it. You also didn't ask for any precision. You copied an interpretation. What are you talking about? I replied to the elements you put in your comments. And it's not serious to base your entire argument on the position of a single person. You're like a Catholic who tells me that I'm right, it's in my book, a book largely interpreted any which way. > It's not. Not my fault if you didn't take the trouble to read it entirely. And yet, it didn't take long to highlight the incoherence of YOUR interpretation. > I regret to inform you that you gave your opinion about the question of nationality and you showed that you had a binary view. And you confirmed this without showing it. This game is fun. > You shouldn't have given your opinion. It's funny to write this kind of thing in a public forum. > So you didn't understand anything. This is included nowhere in my comments. No, it's in your interpretation of the text you gave. Everyone looks out for themselves. When I tell you that it's rotten and you'd be better off stopping intrumentalizing. > Together, but not with each person. When you want to remove French people from the whole, this is no longer together. Once again, you're double-edged. > Well, yes. You confused living together and living with everyone.

What are your anti-troll/fake news tactics?

Le Monde varies a bit it's generally pretty good, as is Euronews for facts).  If you want a quick overview of current affairs for the day, a glance at AFP/Reuters is more than enough. It's not as if 24-hour news channels or free newspapers have some kind of added value.  In order to avoid filling your head with fake news, you have to start by staying away from social media and waiting for the outcome of an event before judging it. Even if you don't follow current affairs, you often hear about them anyway so you don't have to follow an investigation day after day as long as the arrest hasn't been made or the prosecutor hasn't held a press conference yet (bearing in my mind that they never tell all).	fr

Your experience in a hair salon. I rarely go to the hair salon because if I have to spend €40 every time I wanted a touch-up, I'd have to file the report. I rarely leave satisfied with the results in any case. So, since I have to go get a re-cut afterward and get the impression of wasting my money, I might as well cut and color myself. I also cut my boyfriend's hair (who hasn't set foot in a hair salon in 6 years - he hates it). I go to the hair salon whenever I want to something that is out of my abilities (most recently, highlights), but this is at most once a year. I'm clearly not a hairstylist, but at least I know my hair and how it reacts, so hairstylists who start off by washing your hair twice in a row and give you a harsh blow-dry, perfect: you've put my hair in a state it would never have been in naturally, so I have to re-wash my hair myself if I don't want to look ugly. So, what I'd like in my ideal hair salon: - a hair salon without a radio at full volume: put on a bit of quiet music. - people who talk quietly, with no intrusive questions (seriously, sometimes I feel like I'm in an interrogation) - listen to the demands of your clients, please, instead of always doing things your way - opening hours with appointments only to reduce waiting times - low-cost re-touch prices, like for roots or bangs. Otherwise, I've never been asked if I'd washed my hair that day, in which case it would be sufficient just to wet it. Or if I have a sensitive scalp. Make it so that my scalp doesn't end up burnt. And stop with our obsession of putting on hairspray all the time.	fr

However, it's used in the context of distributed applications (such as data feedback, BDD sensors and display). I'm not talking about pure web development, in which case it's weak compared to even angular (I only know angular by name, please don't start any conflict trying to decide which JS is best)  It seems to corroborate the fact that I saw a few internship or employment offers in JavaEE.

"Needing feedback about vasectomy. Recently, an attempt at a male birth control pill revealed that the problem is partially due to an evaluation of risk. Doctors are tested *individually* about ""(risk avoided)-(risk caused)."" For women, the pill will cause certain risks for the health (especially blood clots), but these risks are far lower than the same risks associated with pregnancy. So ""(risk avoided) > (risk caused),"" so everything is fine. For men, it's different. The pill causes (among other things) a higher risk of blood clots, but doesn't avoid any. The male pill doesn't prevent pregnancy in the person taking it, so the sum of ""(risk avoided)-(risk caused)"" is negative, so it isn't good and the medicine should be refused. Of course, the male pill makes the man take the risk that his partner wouldn't, so from the couple's point of view, the balance is positive. But as I understand it, this isn't how the calculation is made."	fr

As a result, what does it have to do with a patriarchal bias/promotion within a company if women don't have the qualifications and that being a social assistant, daycare assistant (98% women), secretary (98% women) should be paid less than a computer engineer? At my job, it's amazing: women are in HR, communications, accounting, and don't really care about my job, which is deemed ""technical and austere"" (as if accounting wasn't austere), and never, never would have wanted to have done the same studies as me.

Washington doesn't want to label fast food in the Nafta countries. The problem is the same with labellings of 100g. Actually, if we take your cereal example and do a quick calculation , 1 portion + 1/2 portion (30g) + 15g, so 45g, rather than if you calculate with 100g, or you'll have to do complicated calculations and divide everything in half. And plus your results will be less precise. For oils, I quickly checked 5 different brands, 2 coming from the US and 3 from Canada (1 in spray). The American ones all the nutritional information with 1 tbsp or 15g, and the Canadian ones gives them for 2 tsp or 10 g. If you eat your Campbell soup (who would eat something like that, it's so full of sugar, salt and other preservatives), you could easily know how much you've consumed. People who are worried about the color of the label are already the people who turn the cans over to read the labels, who make time to ''calculate'' because they want to take care of their health or they have a health condition where they have to watch what they eat. However, the labels are targetting the people who don't watch what they eat, who will never care, and as I was saying in another message, it doesn't matter if you put 100g portions or if you put in a color or letter code, maybe they'll even use the code but not in that way it was intended. They can say ''this product is code A, so I can eat as much as I want'' or ''if the portion says 100g, it means I can eat 100g with no problem.'' At the end, you just move the problem along without really changing anything. I don't think it will solve obesity or heart disease. It would be more useful to provide education on how to read the labels bu then again, the audience that would be targeted would either not be interessed or wouldn't be able to undersantd. Note: If I'm not mistaken, the quantities written on the labels are the recommended quantities according to the nutritionnal guidelines.	fr

If you kill people because they don't have the same religion as you, you're not French.	fr

"WWF: Faced with the ""climate shock,"" biodiversity is threatened with massive extinctions. If the warming continues up to +4.5°C, half of the species in regions with the richest fauna and flora (Amazon, Australia & the Great Barrier Reef, the Mekong) may disappear by 2080. Unless you have 10 different species of plankton and you reduce them to 5, the remaining 5 can very well occupy the ecological niche of the 5 that disappeared (after all, there's less competition). There's a big difference between having a species that disappears and all the species that fulfill a role in an ecosystem. For example, in the tropical forests, you can find ultra-specialized species that live only in certain places with certain plants. If they disappear, well, other plants that can tolerate the warming will take their place and bring in their ultra-specific species with them. Then, yes, if an entire link in the chain disappears, it would disastrous, but given all the redundancy, it's not that likely that we'll be watching a collapse. After all, compared with the tropics, temperate climates are already a desert of biodiversity (since well before man has existed)."	fr

You're caught red-handed manipulating or with fake news (Speech by Bannon to the FN).

The_Donald is a curious blend of propaganda, bullshitting and freedom of expression (oriented, so not truly free) that you don't find elsewhere, even by transposing to other political movements or parties. I agree with your opinion about politicians' methods. It's especially the manipulations and simplifications by the mass media (and repeated by people) that pose a problem for me.

An high leader of Goldman Sachs named secretary of State in German.

But It is not possible. ** Other part** to respond at your sentence : > it is me or there is a huge conflict of interest  ? I will make myself the lawyer of the devil but the fact to have work with Goldman Sachs does not reveal a big interest conflict. Nothing say that, a priori, that person will use his position with abusive power in favour of Goldman Sachs. they would be a conflict of interest for sure if this person would continue to work for Goldman Sachs in parallel of his term of secretary of state. Now, we are **well agree** : chances that would happen are far to be bad. There is high chances that those professional relationship passed would try to use its position to enjoy.

Ranking of global fortunes: a Frenchman lifts himself up to the 4th place. The concern is that if he dies, the State will take more or less 45% of what he has. Beyond the moral and ideological considerations, let's see what that would do concretely: - he owns 46% of LVMH, that is 46% of a group with a market cap of 122 billion. - that would be 25 billion for the State in LVMH shares (45% below 1 million Euros). The concern is that the State does not wish to be an owner of LVMH, so it would sell its portion.   - a large increase in the offering of LVMH shares ---> a drop of share price.  - loss of influence of the Arnault family in Group LVMH, with the arrival of new shareholders. Potentially a new drop in share price. His death would mean the ruin of the company he built. He understands it so he goes to Belgium where the tax treatment of inheritance is lower. Same thing when he had ISF, he would have had to sell 1% of his shares each year (being also taxed on the profit from the sale), 20 years later that would mean that only 25% of Groupe LVMH would be owned by him. You have the same control over a group with 25% as with 45%. That's all the worry about these taxes on capital, it has an economic impact beyond the tax receipts of the State. As a rational guy he would never want to lose control of his business in 2 decades just to be a good citizen. So he scrams.	fr

I had a dream today: I bought an tiger for eating at an internet site, for about a week.  Although it was described as a tiger, it was just a baby, about the size of a kitten. The tiger was delivered alive, so I thought I had better slaughter it.  I looked at the manual and it told me to wrap the tiger's head in a towel and bash it against a wall several times to kill it. It was fierce for a baby.  I desperately kept bashing it against the wall.  When I had killed it, I ate it just as it was.  It was delicious; tender and crunchy, like chicken flesh.  Surplus energy.	ja

"TIL there's something called TrumpScript, a language based on Trump  EJBs, we had a project on their use in distributed applications. Going by what I was told by the guys in continuing education (or ""trainees with X years of experience"" if you don't know), ejbs and javaee are still used quite a bit for that purpose in business, especially because there's Redhat behind it which is pretty helpful for businesses. On the other hand, it's used in the context of distributed apps (e.g. data return sensors in bdd and display), I'm not talking about pure web development where it's basically crap compared even to angular (I only know angular by name don't start fighting about which js is best) That seems to corroborate the fact that I've seen several offers for internships or jobs in javaee, afterwards, well it's not necessarily a sign of quality."	fr

"Compiègne: the children deal drugs, the whole family is kicked out of social housing. But here, the goal, as it says in the article, to to ""set an example"" and dissuade others from doing the same. > The fact that they decided (or were pushed) to deal drugs. Ha ha. Otherwise, they could have gone to school (or not), find a job, even if it's an awful job, and move their asses. And not deal drugs. Because also, they must have made money with it; it was 7 years. It's their problem. If they screw up, they need to assume responsibility. And there were aware that it put their family in ""danger"" of expulsion since social housing had asked for their expulsion 3 times. The mother is paying the consequences, but they're her kids. Not strangers. > This hasn't solved any underlying problem. It would probably be a prison sentence 10x higher than the risk. Without parole, or as some might say: ""Cut off their hands"" (even though it's barbaric, it's effective). > People are also filing complaints. And so? Do you prefer assigning a residence to a 2-parent family, and 4 (big) children, 3 of whom are drug-dealers, or the same without dealing? You might as well kick them out and bring in another family in the housing that needs it more (or as much, but I doubt if you base this on the fact that dealing is the basis of a business, and it makes money)."	fr
