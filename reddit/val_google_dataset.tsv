"VIDEO.""We were all manipulated"": Mamère regrets her participation in the media, the webtélé close to the ""rebellious""> I take object, yes. Language is rich enough to designate things by the appropriate terms adequate term according to rules that you have given yourself before, of course.> ""I"" (it's not just me) choose the only invariants that make sense, which are systematically found in all contexts. The invariants who allow to have a supposed discussion, since based on words with a little more precise definition than those where everyone puts their own definition. The only invariants that make sense according to your criteria, and I do not think that they are the only ones to find themselves ""systematically in all contexts"" in fact, nobody puts their own definition in words, their senses remain stable, and are the subject of conventions, so that does not drive so much the discussion.> It is impossible to have a debate, for example, on communism, if one is based on the definition of the term as it is defined by (mainly) Marx, father of this ideology, and if the other is based on an artificially constructed and overlapping ""definition"" boiling down to ""Stalin"". Hence the interest in adopting the definition of the greatest number, I do not see how to adopt a definition chosen according to your own standards is supposed to make the situation clearer. Because, more or less everyone understands that the left is the left in relation to the political spectrum, there is no communication problem on it. But if not, it is a completely exaggerated problem, because as well as the interlocutors do it expressly obscure, I do not see how confusion is maintained for a long time in a serious debate. There are already polysemies, they are not really a problem, we can easily, when someone talks about realism, knowing if he talks about philosophical thesis, doctrine in international relations, or the word in its ""daily"" use. It is actually enough, to specify that we are talking about Marx. Even if you could say that there is a certain proximity between Marx type communism and communism as it is commonly understood (that is to say, the political regime of the USSR) in the minds of people. There is no definition that is not artificially constructed, your definition of communism, it has descended from heaven on a sacred book where it was created by man? Otherwise Marx is not the father of communism, the association of the word communism with the common property of the means of production and the riches precedes Marx of about a century, as for the idea, it was already present in antiquity, he developed an analysis of society, a theory of history, as well as a criticism of capitalism, and other things, but he did not create the idea of ​​communism, nor the word. Edit: But perhaps his intervention changed the concept of communism (it would be ironic)"	fr

Advice for visiting Disneyland Paris The prices vary quite well depending on the day of the week and the season, and the park is ** much ** more pleasant when there are not too many people. If you can avoid the weekend, and the period May-September is much better (when I go there, I aim for rainy Tuesdays off vacation, I never wait more than 30 minutes for big attractions). After, if it's for your girlfriend's birthday:/ to answer your question, the two parks are still better, especially without children (for which the classic Disneyland park is enough). If you don't have too many people (see previous point), you can chain attractions and not spend 75% of your time there in the queues. If it's weekend in May, during a bridge, take a single park. But you will want to come back when, blocked in a queue for 5,24,274 minutes for an attraction of 90 seconds, you will hear people in front of you boast an attraction of the other park! Otherwise little advice: * the parking lot is very expensive, but free if you stay in one of the Disney hotels (which are expensive, but correct).* Provide good comfortable shoes, you will trample for hours * don't try to take on your picnic, it's prohibited. You can risk it, but hey, to win 10 balls ... * Look at tour operators or via your which sometimes have interesting small reduces.	fr

Truly automatic cars do not yet exist and are relatively far from existing. Tesla's ""autopilot"" is for the moment more a marketing speech than an automatic car, and frankly I find that it is criminal to give this name at the moment given the low level of the bouzin. I agree that in the future at an unknown deadline there will probably be automatic cars 100 to 1000 times safer than manual driving, and I even think that if the manufacturers really want to be satisfied with a factor 10 for the mass introduction on the market it will go badly from the point of view of opinion. Even with 100 the transitional period may not be easy. But the transition between these two extremes will not happen overnight. And even if more ""important"" ethical problems than to know how to solve the hypothetical of the decision to where to lead the danger as a last resort, it seems to me extremely premature to declare peremptory that it is a false problem, since the state of the stammering art still leaves the door open to a lot of possibilities."	fr

You mean that I must demonstrate that they are for the disappearance of the French state in their area of ​​influence? I have the impression that you are very badly informed.> It does not show anything that we are xenophobic. To show it, you should find hostility to foreigners. You still haven't found it. In fact hostility to people who do not have the right skin color or not exactly good culture, it is also xenophobia. To make differences on this basis, regardless of the nationality of individuals is xenophobia. You have to stop doing etymology to understand the words, start by integrating their definition.> You haven't seen much to tell the truth. Above all, you should read the text. You will see the fight to fight France is easy to understand. Where we arrive at your limits in argumentation. Basically you explain to me that you are unable to defend your point of view.> A nation is a great solidarity, constituted by the feeling of the sacrifices that we have made and of those that we are willing to do again.

This is your vision of the nation and it has nothing to do with the way in which nationality is determined. A Frenchman has no obligation to respect your little delirium to be and remain French.> No since they do not share our past. Another partial reading or even not reading on your part. Sharing the past means absolutely nothing. For a personal basis, I do not share the glories or past errors and that does not prevent me from being French. Given the average level in the history of the French, you would better not be clever with this notion of past. At the end the only French will be three historians who have studied the subject.> Proof that not. It's not that you don't agree that you are unable to read an entire text. So you ridicule yourself by taking pieces as you just did with the Islamists. In fact you confuse ""or"" and ""and"" but I am not able to read a text. Let me laugh while you continue to ridicule yourself.> Article 25-1 provides that forfeiture is only incurred if the facts alleged against the person concerned occurred prior to the acquisition of French nationality or within the period of ten years from the date of this acquisition....> It's normal because you haven't seen much. You have not read the texts and I doubt that you know the Constitution. I like your little personal attacks, it doesn't make you live very well together and it makes you a French of paper.> And not.

"Check my brother addict on online games Good evening, already I sympathize because it is not easy to live for you and your mother. I share my experience if you are useful. I don’t know what my real goal was when I was playing if it’s not to be first in everything I was doing. The video game is perfect for that. I also received the Atari from my big brother when the PCS became more democratized and had access to video games very early on. I had facilities in school and not too many problems keeping my head out of the water. I saw other players worse than me but I think my parents must have been more than fed up (at the time I used Aircrack, I went up a second router in the garage when my parents were going to bed to continue playing, I screwed up a keylogger on my parents' PC etc ...). The constraints that I was put in place was only eating a vicious circle. I'm not going to go too much but just say that what made me decrease my activity was to have had a grace disease that prevented me from registering in various post-bac subsidiaries. Due to an almost lost year in sight and infeeding at home, I took the first exit door that I was offered and I went to Canada on the English side to do the dishes/cleaning in a B&B of a foster family that held this business. Finding myself in immersion with tasks to accomplish with real work slowed down my addiction enormously. Unfortunately thereafter I resumed my addiction because I learned English almost in a ""fluent"" manner allowed me to easily enter a post-bac sector in which I brought myself but necessary for my goal to return to a higher business school (beautiful bullshit with hindsight but I will not detail). In short from in my pocket, I was booted in the business school competition (I thought in my ability to get out of it without working too much). Panic among parents and awareness for me, it is where I started to talk about me about me of my problem not to control my playing time. I even went to see a shrink of the Marmottan ** hospital. It helped me little but I was in a phase where I accepted that I could not control myself and the more I spoke about it, the better I felt responsible for others who were aware. Miracle subsequently, an announcement from the university attached to my DUT made me go in exchange in England for 1 year and that is where I hung up almost definitively.""Almost"" because I always bought a console to follow the new features but I have always managed to say no and resell it as soon as I felt that I fell back into my old flaws. It's a difficult time for you but not necessarily a drama for your brother's future. My father spent his time saying that I will end up homeless and it is rather its opposite that happened. I think that a social contract is a good idea, that is what I did and it limited conflicts during my DUT (work + result in priority and I am not bothering up to X hour in the evening). Loot boxes must be prohibited which are an unnamed scourge. You have to proscribe all superfluous expenses (Discord Nitro, Cosmetic DLC, ...) A good idea would be to question it about its future, what does it want to do later? Help him better find his way. Sometimes our parents put in huge pressure on us. From the moment when I left abroad left to myself, it was there that I really started to find my way. P-E Find a similar idea?"	fr

Are Women Paid Less Than Men for the Same Work? Yes finally the context was far from ideal and you didn't give it the choice too much ... Finally. Do you really believe that deep down your husband dreams of playing with your daughters and helping you at home, but that it is patriarchal society that forces him to be at work?> count more for him than the rest I deduce that no and you are well aware of it. Personally I don't think it would have amused my father a lot to have to take care of me more than he did, he had more interesting to do. My mother she had that to fuck so ... and it is a diagram that I see in too many women. There is surely a societal part but hey it's like that, everyone is shit, what is certain is that I will not be trapped like that, I imagine that too well what it would give. No, no, no! And I don't even understand what to complain about, if you want to do it and it brings you something, do it, you don't have to, you could also decide that your career is better and pay people to take care of your children. Some do it. You have a choice, like everyone else (in the West in the cultivated and educated diapers, which are the only ones to have the leisure to complain about the kind). You have done yours, maybe under social pressure, maybe not, which is not shared by your husband, that's all. Personally I also know mine, yet in my family they do not hate children, I think I just saw what it was that it was that a passion in a family context, that I have mine, and that it just does not stick. And then you constantly repeat here even than your job you can not find better anyway etc, it is that lures all that, stories that we tell ourselves to reassure ourselves (I have mine too huh).	fr

"A popular public elementary school in Tokyo, the class collapses in Obuchi Yuko's son's class. I can emulate the jap-giving brain with high precision... Every time I get homework for a kanji drill or arithmetic drill, I get told, ""Hey Obuchi Nko, you can just make a hole just because you don't want to do your homework? Don't be unfair? Do it seriously?"", and every time there are events like school festivals or sports festivals, they say, ""Hey Obuchi Nko, the real thing is, right? It's not a drill? Don't be so messy. Do it seriously?"", and when it's time for recess, everyone chases me off and forces me to take off my panties. There are real worlds of kiddos who bully parents by scrutinizing their misdeeds and guilts on their children, so the above-mentioned imagination is not particularly absurd. Bullying kids are taught in various ways by their parents (usually their mothers) within the household. Looking at the insidious brat's actions, you can see the personality of your parents"	ja

Washington does not want labeling against junk food in Alena countries honestly I don't see the point of putting color codes or letters on food. All the foods that can be bought except for the fruits and vegetables sold in bulk have the detailed list of fats, carbohydrates, proteins, fibers, trans fat, vitamins, sodium .... which they contain. To this is added the number of calories for a certain quantity. Just read to find out if the product is too fatty, too sweet ... too good for your health. Add the color codes or letters and consider that adults who do the shopping are unfit to choose the right foods, I find that it is infantilizing people. Whether you put distinctive signs or not people who want to buy junk will buy it. We already know that some products are less healthy and facilitate obesity and yet they continue to sell themselves like hotcakes. Unless I put a skull on it as on corosive products, I don't think some codes are changing consumption methods.	fr

Are Women Paid Less Than Men for the Same Work? Yes finally the context was far from ideal and you didn't give it the choice too much ... Finally. Do you really believe that deep down your husband dreams of playing with your daughters and helping you at home, but that it is patriarchal society that forces him to be at work?> count more for him than the rest I deduce that no and you are well aware of it. Personally I don't think it would have amused my father a lot to have to take care of me more than he did, he had more interesting to do. My mother she had that to fuck so ... and it is a diagram that I see in too many women. There is surely a societal part but hey it's like that, everyone is shit, what is certain is that I will not be trapped like that, I imagine that too well what it would give. No, no, no! And I don't even understand what to complain about, if you want to do it and it brings you something, do it, you don't have to, you could also decide that your career is better and pay people to take care of your children. Some do it. You have a choice, like everyone else (in the West in the cultivated and educated diapers, which are the only ones to have the leisure to complain about the kind). You have done yours, maybe under social pressure, maybe not, which is not shared by your husband, that's all. Personally I also know mine, yet in my family they do not hate children, I think I just saw what it was that it was that a passion in a family context, that I have mine, and that it just does not stick. And then you constantly repeat here even than your job you can not find better anyway etc, it is that lures all that, stories that we tell ourselves to reassure ourselves (I have mine too huh).	fr

"Climate: coal alone kills the Paris agreement is a false dichotomy.

CO2 and all the tralala. Then you bring it back, you refine it, all that. Afterwards, once screwed up in the reactor, it creates a lot of heat. Not CO2, but pure heat. So technically, if, nuclear participates, on its scale, in global warming. Then, your argument is a false dichotomy because you start from the principle that there are only two solutions (nuclear or fossil energy), while solutions are full. I give you two, out of excess: - We drastically limit the use of electricity. Particularly because within 10 - 15 years there is more oil for everyone and will have to tighten your belt on energy. With a reduction in energy consumption, you can close several power plants.- We invest massively in renewable energies. We can never reach the energy volume that we reach with the fossil/nuclear duo, so it is accompanied with a reduction in energy consumption."	fr

"[Correction] Attacks in Aude: the shooter acquired French nationality in 2004, and not in 2015 >> no.>> If I have given examples. I showed you that it was not examples.>> So what?>> Two speeds.>>> This is not what Renan means. He does not say ""desire to live together with all the French"".>> The desire to live together but not with everyone. Together but not with each.> It's beautiful but it doesn't make sense. You should work on your text analysis. And yes. You confused living together and living with everyone.>> So you didn't understand.>> You don't think like me -> Magic thought -> You didn't understand. De facto you have distorted the text that you did not understand.> Is it the Slip festival or else? Pay your level ... >> Read the whole text instead of making passages that you did not understand by showing everyone that you did not understand them.>> It is you who swings passages like proofs of your delirium. Sorry for you if your analysis does not resist the extracts you provide. The analysis is resistant to the extracts provided precisely. Still they would have to read and understand them and not distort them as you do.>> The text has also been widely commented on, there are conferences on official sites to help you understand given the visible lack of knowledge on your side.>> And who tells you that I want all my thought to come from reading a person's work? It would always be better than your non -reading and your not understanding. But I can see that you don't want to understand. You want to treat those who do not agree with you xenophobic. Without any evidence of their xenophobia.> I don't know if you know but the world has changed a lot since the writings of this gentleman. And that does not change the fact that current France inherited this conception of the nation, as evidenced by the official texts.>> No.>>> Yes.>>> No.>> Is it by what you are unable to have a coherent speech that you do not have? I have already argued. You no. You said something without reasoning or proof.>> You haven't dug.>> I just scraped a little and the thing is completely broken. So you lied to saying that you dug. Thank you at least for admitting that you have no intention of understanding the position of others. You want to force your interpretation of the position of others. It's funny. To reason by the absurd it is as if I told you that you want to consider terrorists as 100% French because you hate France. It is called a trial of intention and it is the zero level of reflection.>> You stopped a simplistic vision of complex conceptions like nationality.>> I took what you gave me. No because we gave you a long text in reference and you did not read it. You did not ask for any details, you have apected an interpretation.> Not my fault if your presentation is simplistic. It is not. Not my fault if you did not bother to read it in full.>> You have a binary and ultra simplistic vision of nationality.>> My boy, I regret informing you that this is your vision of nationality we are talking about. I regret that you inform you that you gave your opinion on the question of nationality and that you showed that you had a binary vision. Should not give your opinion.> By the way your vision has nothing to do with that of the Republic. You do not respect the Republic -> French of paper. So you didn't understand anything. It does not appear anywhere in my comments."	fr
