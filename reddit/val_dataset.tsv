"VIDEO. ""We've all been manipulated"": Mamère regrets participating in Média, the web-TV station affiliated with the ""Insoumis."" > I object, yes. The language is sufficiently rich to designate things by the appropriate term. An appropriate term according to the rules you yourself gave before, obviously. > ""I"" (not me, ok?) choose the only invariables that make sense, which are found systematically in every context. Invariables that let you have a sensible discussion being based on words with definitions that are more precise that those where everyone gives their own definition. The only invariables that make sense according to your criteria, and I don't think they're the only ones to be found ""systematically in every context."" In fact, no one gives their own definition to the words. Their meaning remains stable and are subject to conventions, so this doesn't hinder the discussion that much. > It's impossible to have a debate, for example, about communism of one bases themselves on the definition of term as (mostly) defined by Marx, the father of this ideology, and if the other bases themselves on an artificially constructed and cliché ""definition"" summarized to ""Stalin."" Hence the interest of adopting the definition of the greatest number. I don't see how to adopt a definition chose according to your own standards is supposed to make the situation any clearer Because, more or less everyone understands that the left is the left with relation to the political chessboard. There's no communication problem here. But otherwise, this is a greatly exaggerated problem, because at least those in the discussion are being obscure on purpose. I don't really see how the confusion can be maintained for so long in a serious debate. There are already polysemies, and they don't really pose a problem. When talking about realism, you can easily know if we're talking about the philosophical thesis, the doctrine of international relations, or even of the word in its ""everyday"" use. In fact, it's enough to specify that we're talking about Marx. Even if you could say that there's some proximity between Marx-type communism and communism as commonly understood (i.e., the political regime of the USSR) in people's minds. There's no definition that is artificially constructed. Did you definition of communism fall from the sky in a sacred book or was it created by man? Anyway, Marx isn't the father of communism: the association of the word ""communism"" to common ownership of the means of production and wealth precedes Marx by about a century. As for the idea, it was already present in ancient times. He developed an analysis of society, a theory of history and a critique of capitalism, and other things, but he didn't create idea of communism or the word. Edit: Perhaps his involvement changed the concept of communism (this would be ironic)."	fr

Advice for visiting Disneyland Paris\\nThe prices vary quite a bit according to the day of the week and the season and the park is a **lot** more pleasant when there aren't too many people. If you can avoid the weekend and the period from May to September, it's a lot better (when I go, I aim for rainy Tuesdays outside of school holidays and never wait longer than 30 minutes for the big rides). That said, if it's for your girlfriend's birthday :/ To answer your question, both parks is best, especially without kids (for whom the classic Disneyland park is enough). If there aren't too many people (see previous point), you can do one ride after the other and not spend 75% of your time there in queues. If it's a long bank holiday weekend in May, only do one park. But you'll want to come back when,  stuck in a queue for 524274 minutes for a 90 second ride, you hear the people in front of you praising a ride in the other park! Otherwise, some bits of advice: *Parking is very expensive but free if you're staying in one of the Disney hotels (which are expensive but decent). *Take comfortable shoes, you'll be shuffling around for hours. *Try not to cheat by taking a picnic in, it's forbidden. You can risk it but for 10 euros... *Check with tour operators or your work council, who often have interesting little offers.	fr
How can you protect yourself faced with the planned transportation strike? OP is surprised about not being paid if he can't work because his means of transportation isn't working due to weather. Since you mentioned the BTP as an example where you can be paid without working because of the weather, I wanted to know if you were referring to 1) if the workplace is not compatible with the job (worksite in snow, wind, etc.), you're still paid 2) (the OP's case) if the employee can't come (because his usual mode of transportation isn't working due to snow), but the place of work is still usable (for example, indoors), you're still paid.	fr

Truly automatic cars don't exist yet and are relatively far from existing. Tesla's ""autopilot"" is for now more marketing discourse than an automatic car, and frankly, I think that it's criminal to give this name now given the low level of the cars. I agree that in an unknown future time, there will probably exist automatic cars that are 100 to 1000 times safer than manual driving, and I even think that if manufacturers really want to settle for a factor 10 for the mass introduction on the market, it will turn out badly from the point of view of public opinion. Even with 100, the transition period may not be easy. But the transition between these tow extremes won't be done from one day to the next. And even if ethical problems more ""important"" that knowing how to solve the hypothetical one of deciding where to drive the danger as a last resort, it seems to be extremely premature to hastily declare that it's a false problem, given the state of the technology in its infancy still leaves the door open to many possibilities."	fr

Advices for a trip to Disneyland Paris. Prices differ depending on the day, the week, the season and the parc is *a lot* more enjoyable when it's not too busy. If you can avoid week ends, and between May to September, it's a lot better. (When I go I try to aim for rainy Tuesdays outside of school vacation, I never wait more than 30 minutes for the busiest attractions). But then, if it's for your girlfriend's birthday :/ To answer your question, getting tickets for both parcs is better, especially if you don't have kids, for whom the classic Disneyland parc is enough), If it's not too busy (cf previous point), you can go through attractions without spending 75% of your time in the queues. If it's a week end in May, during a national holiday, only go for one parc. But you'll want to come back when, stuck for 524274 minutes for a 90 seconds ride, you hear the people in front of you in the queue talking about how amazing one of the rides in the other parc is! Other than that, little advices: * Parking lot is very expensive, but free if you stay in one of the Disney hotels (which are expensive, but pretty good). * plan on taking comfortable shoes, you'll be walking for hours * Try to sneak in your own lunch, even though you're not allowed to. You could risk it, but only to save like, 10$ ... * Look up travel agencies' deals or through your CE which sometimes offer interesting discounts.	fr

"Controlling my brother, who's addicted to online games. Good evening. First, I sympathize because it's not that easy living for you and your mother. I'm sharing my experience if ever it can be of use. I don't know what my real goal was when I was playing, if not only just to be the top at everything I undertook. Video games are perfect for this. I also got an Atari from my big brother when PCs got popular, and had access to video games very early on. I had an easy time in school and not too many problems keeping my head above water. I saw other players who were much worse than me, but I think that my parents must have been quite fed up (at the time, I was using Aircrack. I set up a second router in the garage, when my parents went to bed, so I could keep playing. I put a keylogger on my parents' PC etc.). The constraints they put on me only fed into a vicious cercle. I won't spread myself too thin, but I'll just say that what made me reduce my activity was catching a disease that forced me to drop out of several higher education programs. Due to a year almost wasted and lots of fighting at home, I took the first exit out that was offered to me, and I left for English-speaking Canada to be a dishwasher/housekeeper in a B&B for a host family that ran the business. Finding myself immersed in chores to be done with a real job really slowed down my addiction. Unfortunately, after that, I took it back up because I learned English more or less ""fluently,"" letting me more easily get into higher education programs, where I struggled, but it was necessary for my goal of going back to business school (this was a mistake, looking back on it, but I won't get into the details). In short, with my degree in hand, I started competing to get into business schools (I believed in my ability to get by without working too much). With my parents panicking and a moment of realization for me, this is why I began talking to people about my problem with not controlling my gaming time. I even went to see a psychiatrist at **Marmottan Hospital**. This helped me a bit, but I was in a phase when I'd accepted that I couldn't control myself, and the more I talked about it, the more responsible I felt with regard to others who knew about it. Then came the miracle: an announcement from the university to gave me my degree that would send me off for a 1-year exchange in English, and this is when I almost definitively stopped. ""Almost"" because I still bought a console to keep up with new releases, but I always managed to tell myself ""no"" and resell it as soon as I felt that I would relapse to my old habits. This is a difficult time for you, but not necessarily a drama for your brother's future. My father spent his time saying that I'd end up homeless, and quite the opposite actually happened. I think that a social contract is a good idea; this is what I did, and it limited conflict during my degree study (work + results in top priority, and no one bothered me late into the night). We should ban loot boxes, which are an unspeakable plague. We need to prohibit superfluous spending (Discord Nitro, DLC, cosmetic packages, etc.). One good idea would be to ask him about his future - what does he want to do in the future? Helping him find his path as best as possible. Sometimes, our parents put a lot of pressure on us. From the moment when I went abroad to fend for myself, this is why I truly began to find my path. Perhaps you should find a similar idea."	fr

Are women paid less than men for the same work? Well the context wasn't the best and you didn't really leave him a choice... Anyway I don't care. Do you really think your husband dreams of playing with your daughters and helping you at the house, but that it's patriarchal society that is forcing him to work? >to say they count more for him than anything else, it doesn't look like it and you know it very well. Personally, I don't think my father would have liked to take care of me more than he already did. He had more interesting things to do. My mother only that to do so... And I see this with too many women. Society surely has a part in it, but it's like that. Everybody has their own stuff to do. One thing is for sure, I won't let myself become trapped like that, I can just see what it would look lik. No, no, no! And I don't even know what you are complaining about, if you feel like doing it, then do it, but you don't have to. You could also decide that your job is better et pay people to take care of your kids. Some people do it. You have a choice, like everybody (in Western countries in the upper-middle classes, who are the only ones who have the priviledge of complaining of such a situation). You've made your decision, maybe because of societal pressure, or maybe not, and it's not shared with your husband. That's it. For me, I already know what I've decided, even if in my family they don't hate kids. It's just that I think I saw what passion looks like in a family context, and it doesn't stick with my personality. And you're always repeating that you can't find a better job etc., that's not true. They're just stories you tell yourself (I have my own too, you know).	fr

"Popular public middle school in the city. Chaos in the classroom of Obuchi Yuko's son. I can emulate a Jap brat's mind to a super high precision, so... Whenever there was homework with a kanji drill or an arithmetic drill it was ""Hey, Obuchi kid, I don't want to do the homework, so can you dig a hole and get rid of it? Don't be so sneaky? Do it honestly?"" Whenever there was an event like a school arts festival or athletic festival is was ""Hey, Obuchi kid, today it's for real, right? This isn't a drill? Don't slack off. Do it honestly?"" When it was break time it was ""Hey, Obuchi penis, let's see your special moves. Let's see your penis drill."" He was chased by everybody and his pants were forcibly pulled down, and thinking of that tough daily life being made to cry every day, the image pops into my mind. There are bullies out there who will bully a child for the mistakes or crimes of their parent, so the imagined scene above is not unthinkable.

Washington doesn't want any labels against bad food in the country to Alena. Honestly I don't see the point of putting colour codes or letters on food. All the food you can buy, except fruits and vegetables sold on their own have detailed lists of the fat, carbohydrates, proteins, fibers, trans fats, vitamins, sodium... they contain. They also have the number of calories for a certain amount. You just need to read to find out if the product has too much oil or sugar... or is not healthy. Adding colour codes or letters assumes that adults who go shopping are incapable of choosing the right food, I think that infantalizes people. If we put distinctive signs or not, people will buy junk if they want to. We already know that certain products are less healthy and lead to obesity and even so they fly off the shelves. Short of putting a skull and cross bones on the packet like for corrosive products, I don't think that the codes will change the way people consume.	fr

Are women paid less than men for the same work? Yes, well the context was far from ideal, and you didn't really leave him the choice. But whatever. Do you really think that deep down, your husband dreams of playing with your daughters and helping at home, but the patriarchal society obliges him to go to work? > Don't count on him any more than the rest. I deduce that no, and you're well aware of it. Personally, I don't think that this would have amused my father that much to have to take care of me more than what he did. He had more interesting things to do. My mother only had that to do, so... And this is a pattern I see with much too many women. There's surely a part due to society, but well, that's the way it is. Everyone has their own shit to deal with. What's certain for me is that I won't get trapped like that. I can only imagine what it would be like. No, no, no! And I don't even understand why you would complain. If you want to do it and you'll get something out of it, you don't have to, but could also decide that your career is better in the end, and to pay people to take care of your children. Some people do this. You have a choice, like everyone does (in the west, in cultured and educated layers, who are the only ones to have the leisure to whine about their fate as well). You do yours, and maybe with social pressure, maybe not, which your husband doesn't think, and that's all. Personally, I know my husband as well, but in my family, they don't hate children. I think that I just saw what having a passion means in a family context, that I have mine, and it just doesn't fit. And then, you constantly repeat here even that you can't find anything better for a job in any case, etc. These are just lures; stories we tell ourselves for reassurance (I have my own, too, right?).	fr

About France’s laxity leading to attacks > About laxity > Because of the laxity of the administration > This laxity is pathetic. > Laxity again. The laxity of the French State. Full house, congratulations. Tell me, randomly, do you think French justice is lax? Frankly, it’s the height of laziness to talk about the “successful” attacks… How many others have been thwarted in the meantime? So little hindsight and reflection, it shows a certain laxity. I think that you have no idea of the wok done by the police and intelligence services to prevent this type of attack from happening. I think that you have no idea how little money is given to the justice system to prevent dangerous individuals from acting. Rather than screaming “because French justice is too lenient”, even though our politicians have the unfortunate tendency of giving us “one tragedy, one law”, and while generalized surveillance is nearly a fact of life, rather than to play the “everything needs to be safe” game and going for justification and repression… re-check your reasoning.

Climate: what will the next special report from the GIEC be good fot? The problem with trees is that they only store carbon as long as they're alive, so you have limite per m² of forest. In other words, they'll have to increase the surface area of forests and maintain it for a few centuries. Not to mention that the output per m² isn't great compared to what it emits. And replacing a field with a forest won't greatly improve storage because the wheat you grow also stores CO2 while growing (and as soon as they're eaten, a new field will be planted). Anyway, trees are cool, but unless you bury the excessive quantities of charcoal (and you'll have to keep it from decomposing and returning back into the atmosphere), it won't be enough.	fr

Carrefour launches the 1st food blockchain in Europe. In real terms, what does this change having a blockchain?

Great, isn't it? But... and if you chose shitty data when adding? Well, yeah, actually a blockchain is good for nothing. It's just a slightly more reliable method storing data.

Washington doesn't want any labelling against junk food in the Alena countries. At the same time, you don't really care about the weight for 100g most of the time. Let's take for examples, an egg, on the egg boxes they give you all the nutritional values for an egg, you don't really give a shit about the nutritional values for 100g of egg, your egg might be more than or less than 100g, what you care about is how many eggs you eat. Same things for a bag of cookies, the nutritional value for let's say 45g or ounces is written on there along with the quantity (3 biscuits). You know that if you've eaten 3 biscuits you will have ingested this many carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, calories. You count your biscuits to eat them, you rarely weigh them. Concerning fizzy drinks, the system is quite simple, it's written on the bottles the quantity that's equivalent to one can. Even in the US, the number of calories that you need a day is known, it's even said on TV every day. Those who don't want to follow the recommendations won't be more likely to follow them no matter what the labelling is like.	fr

Read again to sum up the thesis (1/2 page). About the introduction, I would try something that catches people's interest more, something that's more provocative. What are we walking on? On radioactivity. Everywhere on Earth we receive rays that are emitted by natural radioactive substances situated in the Earth's crust. Today, we know this very well. Ok, so what are we walking on? You could imagine... the problems is that there are too many questions with the ones in the other section so she understands the process by which a ray is transformed into an electrical signal in a detector. The thing that bothers me is that 'ray' in singular form suggests that there will be only one kind of ray (of emitted particles?) to analyse, but if I understand, the challenge is to build a triple particle-ray-signal and to get out the ones corresponding to electrons? And in the before-last phase (if it comes to be...) I would delete ''alors'' and ''d'autant,''  and finish with an exclamation mark. That makes a lot of comments, but I think the text is really good, enthusiastic, stimulating and imaginative and you can ''feel'' the machine and the challenge in the background.	fr

Climate : Coal alone is killing the Paris Agreement. This is a false dichotomy. We do not have uranium in France (technically speaking, we have a small reserve, just in case), so we need to go get it in Africa, in Niger, if I recall well. Collecting uranium causes pollution, especially carbon dioxyde and so on. After that, you need to bring it home, refine it, etc. After this is done, you put it in the reactor, which generates a lot of heat, not carbone dioxyde, but pure heat. So technically yes, nuclear power contributes to global warming in a way. Moreover, your point is a false dichotomy, because you assume that there are only two solutions (nuclear or fossil fuel energy), whereas there are many solutions. I can give you two more solutions, for example : - Drastically limiting electricity use, especially because there will not be oil for everybody in 10 to 15 years and we will need to tighten our belts with energy consumption. By reducing energy use, we can close several power plants. - We invest a lot in renewable energy sources. We will never be able to reach the energy production which is reachable with nuclear and fossil sources, so it must also be done through a reduction of our energy use.	fr

"At ONPC, Olivier Besancenot gave a striking advocacy: ""We all are someone else's railroader"". The problem with trains in the U.K., is that the majority of cities to be linked one another are located in the same areas. Broadly, London, its suburb, Birmingham and the Northern cities, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds. In other words, two very densely populated regions and empty regions between them. Moreover, the country has a vertical shape, with one main axis. The opposite of France, with large cities distributed evenly on the entire territory. So nobody ever wanted to invest the necessary funds in the U.K. because return on investment is much lower. Pendulum trains from the eighties were a failure, so old wagons from the seventies or eighties are used to the fullest. A diesel train does the same job for about the same amount of time so why would you change it? The irony here is that most of the railway companies in the U.K. belong to the French National Railway Company, to Veolia (and other national companies such as the Canadian Railways). In simple terms, the French National Railway Company makes the profit in the U.K. that is impossible for them to make in France."	fr
