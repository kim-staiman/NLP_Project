"Washington does not want labeling against junk food in Alena countries The information is already available. The fat is included and detailed in lipids with trans and non-trans. The carbohydrates include the fibers and sugars which are actually called sugars. I regularly receive products from Europe and the nutritional information available on packets is less detailed than on local packages. Besides, gross data in grams are given the daily percentage. For example: it is written 15g of carbohydrates and we tell you that it is 10% of what you have to eat as carbohydrates per day so you know that if you eat this product in the quantity inscribed on the label, you know that you will have swallowed 10% of the carbohydrates you need in your day. Ultimately if you don't know how many grams of carbohydrates or lipids you have to eat per day, you can always refer to the percentage. The color or letter codes just tell you if the product is good or not for health insofar as you respect the amount consumed on the back of the packet with nutritional information. But a category A product can be as harmful as a category D if the person who consumes it does not make sure to consume a reasonable quantity. The problem I see with this system is that people (the least concerned about their health) will take a product A but eat it without limitation, ""well yeah what"", since it is a product A, so it is necessarily good for health. They will not necessarily realize that if they eat this product without controlling the quantities they swallow, they will harm as much as with the category D product in reasonable quantities. The codes can give a false image of a product. Better, in my opinion, educating people to read the labels rather than telling them is that it is not good."	fr

Generally I always make very healthy dishes while being good vectors of pleasure grant me a solo cinema, or I will see the film that I want on a whim to take a walk, take the time to discover corners of my city that I do not know.

I admit I voted Macron that to kill the lazy wage bill and so that the poor creates the open mouth, so I want the planet to die, and if possible allow tax deductions to sufficiently rich people. Or, and wait it will become crazy. People find the same problems but reach different solutions because of philosophical and political differences ... mind. BLOWN. But no, you will continue to swing that the FN is idiots, Macron is elite assholes that the poor like, and while Fi bah they are the nice cute who want to save the world.

Your analysis does not resist you are full of contradiction.> It would always be better than your non -reading and your not understanding. But I can see that you don't want to understand. You want to treat those who do not agree with you xenophobic. Without any evidence of their xenophobia. The evidence was given, not my fault if you do not know how to interpret a text more than a comment.> And that does not change the fact that current France inherited this conception of the nation, as evidenced by the official texts. In which official texts? Personally I don't see your little delirium.> I have already argued. You no. You said something without reasoning or proof. And now you get me a little mirror. Nice illustration of the level of your comments.> So you lied, saying that you have dug. Or we learn that when you write scratch, you understand digging. Serious stop you are humiliating publicly.> Thank you at least for admitting that you have no intention of understanding the position of others. You want to force your interpretation of the position of others. It's funny. Where does this story come from? You mean that if we do not agree with you you put yourself in pls by repeating ""he does not want to understand"".> You want to force your interpretation of the position of others. The latest news, I don't force anything at all, I comment on a forum.> To reason by the absurd it is as if I told you that you want to consider terrorists as 100% French because you hate France. It is called a trial of intention and it is the zero level of reflection. I confirm, your example is absurd, at the zero level of reflection and full of personal attacks.> No because we gave you a long text in reference and you did not read it. You did not ask for any details, you have apected an interpretation. But what do you say, I answered the elements you put in your comments. And it is not serious to base all your argument on the position of a single person. You are like the Catholic who says I am right, it is in my book, book that he has largely interpreted anyway.> It is not. Not my fault if you did not bother to read it in full. And yet, it did not take long to highlight the inconsistency of your interpretation.> I regret informing you that you gave your opinion on the question of nationality and that you showed that you had a binary vision. And you will say it without demonstrating it. It's funny as games.> Should not give your opinion. It's funny to write this kind of thing on a public forum.> So you didn't understand anything. It does not appear anywhere in my comments. No, it is in the interpretation of the text you gave. Everyone sees noon at their door. When I tell you that it is all rotten and you better stop instrumentalizing it.> Together but not with each. When you want to withdraw French people from the whole, it's no longer the whole. Again you are at two speeds.> And if. You confused living together and living with everyone. It will have to be demonstrated."	fr

"A people who die, it dies for a long time I allow myself to respond here, to follow up on /U /Knownyogurt and especially to my own comment above. I will start by bringing certain points back and then we will approach the comment to which I answer. Already, let's welcome your hijacking effort, I would have appreciated that you approach the fact that you do not know the history of Quebec (or at least that you do not realize the impacts), because your conception of history is a big part of the problem and is your biggest obstacle to understand the independence position. It's more than a question of ""we fought a long time ago"". We will come back to it. For illogism, I'm sorry that you see it like that, but it is false, feelings are not only illogicalism. First, my arguments were not only sentimental, I could have produced a text to you practically identical to that of /U /Knownyogurt (and I wrote a few, but hey, I imagine that to restrict myself to say that I think like him will make me appear lazy, but hey, too bad), these are the independentist arguments that have existed since the beginnings of the movement. But beyond that, the desire to be an independent nation, from the moment when we know that it is * minimally * possible from a practical point of view, desire is in large emotional part. The yes camp in 95 was enormously motivated by a particular affect towards this dream that had been sold, moreover, the Canadian campaign was itself a sentimental movement (should I remind you of the Love-in which took place at that time?). I will afford to do my sociologeux here. This kind of motivation is that Max Weber called rational in value, or that we find rational methods to act in concordance to our values. Our emotions build a certain logic of our action while being linked to pragmatic reality. You do it every day, in all the actions where you act without being specifically motivated by a pure instrumental logic: you have chosen to pay more to eat such a thing because you appreciate the taste more than anything else, you voted for such a politician because you loved her ideas more than those of another while knowing that * rationally * I could tell you that it will be absurd to believe that she will realize everything that she says. You voted to stay in Canada (we speak in theory) because you have built a network of reasons that justify staying and you believe in your position as good because it is logical * while others see your arguments as illogical, restricted and naive. We are all a little ""illogical"" because we all have values ​​that predominate about our pure rationality and we are all a little logical because we defend the things that we believe better for our condition. Reducing our actions only to an instrumental logic (which can be calculated as ""more positive"") is a complete gap. I give you a big example. For almost 250 years (I rounded), our world has been mainly dominated by the absurd logic that capitalist development, that is, exploitation for profit through growth, has been a factor in the development of civilization. The evidence is unshakable, through capitalism, our quality of life has improved exponentially! We have come to see growth as a factor in improving the common good and from all the big countries in the world we adopt the method: what is most logical is ""think big st"" and to target growth. When a federalist comes out of economic arguments against separation, for example, we refer to this logic: to hit the economy is to strike everyone. So we try to grow as much as possible because it is logical. Since the 1960s, scientists have noted that capitalists are based on a particular practice, the exploitation of our resources. They also noted that our resources are limited in quantity. On the other hand, capitalist exploitation is so polluting that the biosphere is no longer capable of reabsorb our pollution or our consumption. Obviously capitalism has proposed to reorient itself towards sustainable development, a magnificent oxymoron, believing that it is possible to maintain exploitative growth while erasing costs, but the truth that more and more people seem to accept is that it would be illogical to think that capitalism can, in the long term, ensure that it has offered us in the last two centuries. We begin to think that decrease is the only logical path, an absolutely anti-proofit route and perhaps even against our material well-being in the short term. So my question according to this long development, or is the real logic? What is rational? Was what rational before changed today? But then it is that the rational is not objective. We could just as easily understand the illogism 100 years earlier and avoid the potential disasters that we risk today. Canada is still targeting growth (which can also use immigration to compensate for the low birth rate), but one wonders why growth? It seems to me that the relativism that it raises and the space that this creates can (and always) be filled by ""emotional illogism"" our rationality in value which dictates what is good or not for us, which allows us to make society choices, because there is no objective and absolute response. It is not a question of ""because it tempts us"", it is rather ""because that's what we want"". ***> The people I have met who have a desire to want to separate from Canada are often people who are not able to take advantage of the Canadian Union. It is the same people who complain of being assimilated by the ""English"", but who do not see by the irony of the situation when they decide to make a deaf ear when the First Nations send them the same arguments. Beginning at the end, you will allow me to respond to your Whataboutisme by another, what about the relationship between Canada and the First Nations? But seriously, it is a fairly empty moral argument and I sincerely believe that a sovereign Quebec would be able to better settle its relations with the indigenous peoples. But again, it is a very special situation that deserves its own development, I do not believe that neither you nor I are able to debate it adequately for the moment. Summarizing the separatists to people who complain of being assimilated is an absurd but common reduction, you will allow me to simply ignore the straw man. On the other hand, taking advantage of the Canadian union is a novelty (hilarious) for me you will develop if you want, I am curious. ***> Do you really believe that someone who lives in Vancouver has more things in common with someone who comes from Newfoundland than with a Quebecer? Not certainly not, I am even of the opinion that Canada is absurd as a nation and that many provinces would gain culturally and politically to be independent, I think that the real solution would be a economic union similar to the European Union. Obviously, the problem is always economical. Besides, ""history"" of Canada is mainly a story of economic expansion, but I will not stretch it on this, space is lacking. > But at the same time keeping a aggressiveness because our ancestors fought is not only counterproductive but also detrimental for all. Whenever I hear that (very often), I tell myself that the new federalism that takes in new generations is due to a pathetic knowledge of our history. Our ancestors only fought two moments: the plains of Abraham and the revolt of the patriots. We were not at war, we were a colonized people. It was true until the quiet revolution (seriously I will not give you a history lesson, but if you do not understand the context of ""Speak White"", of Lake Meech, of the current constitutional context and what it encompasses, I can't do much for you). > Quebecers and Ontarians, Albertans, etc. subscribe to the same values, more or less. Emphase on the most or less! Look at all the electoral cards before 2015 for relentless evidence (there is also an imgur gallery with a selection of evidence of the difference in values ​​between Quebec and Roc, but I can no longer find it ...). > Each region of a country has its own requests, which cannot always agree with everyone. Well yes, a big truth that ... But beyond ""it's like that"" it does not contradict ""it should be otherwise"". Your relativism does not illuminate anything. > If your point is that we could be independent economically, I could be convinced, but not because we could do it that we should do it. If we want to do, we should be able to do so. I don't want to kick a police officer, I want to go and live in apartment so that my narcissistic parents stop controlling my life. We do not have the same values ​​and their influence is harmful, they wanted me to build a pipeline in my bed the other day! Again, I come back to my example above, economic prosperity may not be the goal to seek. > [...] Quebec is very capable of working with the other provinces of Canada. In a context of economic union? Probable, but from a cultural and political point of view at the moment, we are far from having the emancipation capacity that you think that the Canadian Federation brings us."	fr

Breakthrough and disbanding national crisis. The Prime Minister certainly declared that and voted. However, looking at the reality that the National Tax Agency Director-General is running around like a fugitive, snatching the power of the Prime Minister and his wife, and seeing the people's trust in tax administration being lost every day, not just the national crisis, the national crisis is expanding. It's now clear. The Prime Minister is the national crisis. The body is an adult, the brain is a child. The name is a savage prime minister Kokunan!	ja

"Cash Impact and pesticides: between errors and sensationalism then the starting point is to know if pesticides is a health problem (public or ""specific""), therefore:> must report the use of pesticides on the agricultural surface no, we must relate to the surface which needs pesticides (Ie included in a technical route or that to sense), otherwise you dilute your figureswill not see or very very little (temporary meadows, permanent or other pastures) and you ignore the real injected dose. The whole problem of comparison follows with countries that do not have the same technical routes. The question is on average if a conventional farmer produces wheat how much should he use this or that pesticide? Eurostats does not answer this question he produces figures which have the aim of bringing elements of answers but it is me who asks me this or that question of whether these figures are useful to me (the overall volume of pesticide is interesting for an economist who works on these markets).> Hey no, we are not so far. Apart from the notion of minimum extent, which I do not quote, we are roughly in the nails (except the exact encryption of the size of the said plants, etc ...). I will quote head but it also seems to me that the FAO includes a recovery criterion which is 10 % (you were talking about it 10 % you will have to seek shade) and speak of surface.10 % is very little, or my joke on the tundra (in a tundra not supposed to have trees and yet you can often arrive at + 10 % recovery rate). Then you were talking about ecosystem, there too I doubt that the FAO would risk it on it because you would be far from it in a lot of cases (popularity, palm grove, etc.). Finally, you should know what is not in the definition of FAO. They collect declarative data from the countries (and they start to check this data).

"In Calais, migrants refuse state meals, returning to the systematic country would be the best solution. For a simple reason. Illegal pay thousands of euros to come. This money comes from family or whole villages which send a ""son of the country"". Each step, the illegal migrant goes to a western union office to seek the money from the next step. The logic is that this person will then start a pump A Sous. He brings his family, his children, will earn money. It will at the same time become the financial pressure of his village (fewer mouths to feed) and reimburse his debt (with Moulte Interets) then send a few hundredqines to help his loved ones. Since 98% of the illite arrival in France remain there in the long term, it is only a matter of time. The village will see its reward efforts. If the illegal migrant is sent home, the villages will see 1) the physical proof of the failure.2) that the money invested has been loss.

"Your opinions on men's perfumes? Already, R/Fragrance exists. It is a Sub a little biased because the Americans do not necessarily like the same things as us but you can have lots of recommendations and ideas. He lets it know that he is released at least a new perfume every day. In the lot you must differentiate two types of offer: - designer scents. These are Dior classics, Hermès, Chanel but also Zara, Devred ... Basically all perfumer, of which it is not the only job. They are rarely very original but are doing well. Please note: big brands often have two lines, a mainstream that you can find in all Sephora, and another more exclusive than you find in luxury store or sign store. The price varies between 10 and 250 € per bottle in general.- ""Niche"" perfumes. Here we are in another universe and more strange and unique things, where the notion of gender fragrance tends to disappear. We oscillate between things that are better versions of existing things, or very original things. I regularly recommend the Maison Zoologist (Canadian Perfumer), which creates perfumes inspired by living spaces and diets of animals such as elephant, the bald mouse or the dragonfly. The prices of niche perfumes vary enormously, and the high limit is ... painful. I advise you to test the perfumes well before buying them. Nothing is worse than paying 100 € a bottle and then telling you that you don't want to wear it. If you are in a big city, you will already have a lot of possibilities in the shops, but if not sites sell what the Americans call ""deciding"" (basically they share bottles in multiple sample format). It allows you to test rare or expensive things without losing a kidney. A point to which I generally be careful is the performance of the perfume.3 criteria are taken into account: - Longevity: does the scent lasts?- wake: is the scent leaves a wake in the rest of its wearer?- Projection: is the scent bears or is it ready for the body? Note that apart from the longevity which is critical, if you carry a perfume for you, the rest is less important. Sometimes niche scents sacrifice longevity with olfactory art, I think among other things because some fragrant molecules simply cannot last long on the skins (it is generally noticed on the perfumes that smell citrus). Terre d'Hermès fulfilled these 3 criteria. It has become a classic, rather carried by men of 30 years and over, but in reality the perfume has no age (and not so much sex). Behind if you like the smell, go there! Note that if, in theory, the concentration of aromatic molecules is different between eau de toilette, watering water and an extract of perfume (at least at most concentrated), this is not always the case and certain perfume versions are less efficient or just very different from their toilet consideration. The conditions also play on performance: room temperature, ambient humidity, body temperature and lipid levels on your skins. Terre d'Hermès fulfilled these 3 criteria. It has become a classic, rather carried by men of 30 years and over, but in reality the perfume has no age (and not so much sex). Behind if you like the smell, go there! Some other things to test easy to find: - Chanel blue - Red Habit - Guerlain (Eau de Toilette) - Kouros - Yves Saint -Laurent - Sauvage - Dior - Tom Ford - Black Orchid (Eau de toilette, Ray of Women) - Egoist - Chanel - Zara - 9.0 in the easy -to -find niche brands and with a varied offer,Cologne."	fr

You will just have lost 3 days for nothing and you had deputies moved for not much in the end. The work of a deputy is not only to sit in parliament. He can be in committee (or 95% of the policy this decides today), he can also be on a diplomatic trip abroad or be in his constituency for example. There are tons of reasons for a deputy to be in the assembly. Some necessarily abuse, but the vast majority of deputies even when they are not in the assembly work anyway.

"After the controversy we gathered puberty, I stop drawing the pipelettes I am not on ... I do not find the extract, but from memory, the authors explain that the breasts excite the boys, not that a big pairs of breasts that's what it takes. I see several interests: 1 - Recall that the breasts actually play a secondary sexual character. One hypothesis is that they effectively grown to serve as a sexual argument and stimulus when the man went standing, and that he no longer had access to the usual stimuli (the buttocks). So he fell back on the curves he had under his nose.2 - Talking allows you to put words and make young girls aware of not doing anything with their breasts. With the number of cases of stripped photos that wander on social networks in the colleges where I officiated, I tell myself that it is no worse to clear things 3 - Pudibonderie about the breasts that will be used to seduce the beautiful Ethan amaze me. This is indeed the case, and talking about it in clear terms seems judicious to me. Otherwise, stop everything that makes it possible to highlight your strengths of seduction ... A if, only when you are an adult? And how do we know we are? And when do we learn? And by whom?4 - From memory the cited extract does not acclaim the big breasts, on the contrary, since it never says ""the better it is the better it is"" and that it ends on the contrary by ""a small chest is very pretty too"" or something in this idea, in short an ode to the difference. And finally, I will give my personal opinion: this controversy has reinforced my concern about the capacity for reading, analysis and decline in the population. Social networks promote rapid propagation of simple and pre-priest information. We are therefore in the process of becoming sheep without real personal opinion or capacity for judgment.

"Alexandre del Valle: ""Islamic correct makes the game of terrorists""> ICM Poll (2016): 21% of British Muslims Decline to Condemn Stoning Adulters (5% Openly Support TheM). Same thing: non -representative survey. Then, here is the question and detail of the results: ""Tell Me Whether You Sympathise or Condemn People Wh o Take part in Stoning Those Who Commit Adultery"".- 2 % ""Completely sympathise"" - 3 % ""Sympathise to some extent"" - 10 % ""Neither sympathise nor condemn"" - 13 % ""Condemn to Some EXTER"" - 66 % ""Complely Condemn"".- 6 % ""Don’t Know"" so, the figures you use do not really correspond to the answers in fact ...> Pew Research (2016): A Majority of Muslims in 10 Countries Favor Basing Laws on the Quran (Inc. Pakistan, Pal. Auth, Malaysia, Jordan, Senegal, Nigeria, Indonesia, Lebanon and Turkey). Educated Muslims also Favored Sharia, included 55% in 'Secular Turkey'. The first sentence was not written by Pew Resarch. This is a real quote: ""Across 10 Countries with meaningful Muslim Populations Surveyed by Pew Research Center in 2015, there is a striking different in the extent to which people think the quran should influence their nation’s laws.». Same thing for the second sentence. This is a real quote from Pew Resarch: ""Generally, More-Educated People Say Laws Should Not Follow Quran"". And the figure about Turkey is false: it's 45 %.> Arab Observatory of Religions and Freedom (2016): 79% of Libyans Believe Sharia Should be the Sole Source of Legislation, as do 63% in Algeria and 60% in Morocco. So the question was not formulated in this way ... The question was not in relation to ""shariaa as the only source of legislation"", but in relation to ""Shariaa as the only source of inspiration of the law"". Then, the figures you quote is the subtotal completely agree and rather agree. However, the two responses are not necessarily equal ... If you just look at it, it is 57 % in Libya, 40 % in Algeria, 40 % in Egypt, 33 % in Morocco, and 11 % in Tunisia.> Africa young - Arab Observatory of Religions and Freedom (2016): Most Muslims in North Africa Say they are Muslim First and Citizens Second. This is a principle source for migrants to Europe. No. The formulation of the question is to feel rather Muslim than a citizen of such a country, not ""to be"". Then, this question was not spontaneous: we did not just ask the respondents ""What do you feel the most?""By letting them respond freely, they were oriented on several choices, which could have influenced their answers. And, it is impossible to know if they had the possibility of giving several answers. Then, there is a lot of variation between countries, and the differences between the percentage of those who cite Muslims and those who cite citizens are more or lower according to the countries. Unfortunately, I don't have time to look at the few references that remain (I might do it later). Instead of bombing approximate figures, often misinterpreted, coming from more or less reliable and interesting sources, it might be better to focus on one or two studies, to find out, and to rely on solid figures that you really know and whose scope you can judge ... (and not just that you saw on the Daily Mail or Breitbart which are far from being references in statistics ... Whether I have not really raised: for all the studies mentioned, there are other figures that allow us to qualify or even thwart the ""selected"" figures here or in the various articles. So, concentrate each time on one or two figures and ignore those that less help the demonstration that you want to make, it is a fairly questionable process and that lacks rigor ..."	fr

If you think about it calmly, even if you find a girlfriend at work, it would be awkward and there would be various risks if you break up or be rejected. I've never used it so I don't know, but I know of the examples I've met on social media. When I make comments on Twitter that make you think you're the same age (like Pokemon Kasumi's first love, watching the Battle Athletes Sports Festival), some people start to get excited. So, Yoshimi, who is the same age, has a friendly conversation, and we become even more friendly through popular content such as Hatsune Miku and Vocaloid, and while we were having fun chat sex (it's like a slut, but it's not sexual harassment because it's the other side), we ended up having serious sex sex, and we decided to meet each other, and then we decided to go out together by DM, and we just started dating normally. Well, it's about my younger brother, but by the way, I thought he was the same age, but when I met him he was four years younger than me, and when I met him he was a first year at his younger brother's university and a third year junior high school student. Apparently he was so devoted to the same age that he really believed he was the same age until he met him. When I opened her body, she looked like a middle school girl... She was a cute and nice girl. He also did housework, and I was busy making my sister break up, perhaps because she was jealous or didn't like it...	ja

Aja that the biggest Kickstarter in Europe in 2017 is a French board game, and that it is great! For those who want to know what the game is in question: it's a board game.* Collaborative: all players have a common objective * exploration: the playground is initially unknown * with cards: there is no game board, the cards placed on the table act as a set * for limited use: there are a certain number of curses to be resolved, but once it is done, the playful interest decreases since we already know the field. Of course, there is a part of random but it remains limited. In practice, the players select a curse at the start, which gives the starting location and an index. The starting card (*card*) is a place, there is a small piece of card (*map*) drawn on it. On the map, there may be challenges (strength, hunting, discretion, etc.) and there may be borders. These numbers designer with other cards (*cards*) which, put in terms of, will form a larger card (*map*). The objective is to browse the territory to arrive at the place where we can lift the curse. You can make a connection for example with the books of which you are the hero.	fr

Google flow at Free, still fucking mouth. I can't watch a YouTube video on my gigabit fiber. Why don't you go from Free? Most others reimburse the resilization costs.

Termination fees reimbursed via ODR and reduction on the first year, I am at € 25.99 for 200 theoretical Mbps (in practice I am rather at 230) it is less than GB but no problem of peering.

"With Deliveroo, the labor inspectorate attacks uberization - article in comment ## Deliveroo considers to have the right for its part, Deliveroo is not the least in the worried world. The company recalls that the positions of the labor inspectorate are ""contrary to the 2016 Labor Law, which introduced into the Labor Code the concept of self -employed worker for digital platforms"". That's right, as explained here by Mediapart. The Labor Law now distinguishes bicycle deliverers and other Uber drivers: since January 1, those who have at least 5,100 euros in annual turnover thanks to platforms have the right to ask them for reimbursement of the sums they pay to insurance companies to ensure a work accident. Deliveroo points out to go ""even beyond in order to assume our social responsibility"", by proposing since last September ""civil liability insurance and free health and supplies insurance"" which cover all the deliverers using its application. The future unemployment insurance reform law should go further to distinguish workers from other self-employed platforms, since the government has planned to offer them in the coming days a specific access to unemployment, different from that which will be reserved for conventional independents, whether they are business leaders, farmers, liberals or micro-entrepreneurs. ""We are indeed going towards the creation of a third status, and the labor inspectorate has just understood this. It is not a simple law that will change the definition of what work is, ""objected Jérôme Pimot, a figure of bicycle deliveryers fighting against platforms (which we presented here and invited here). Asked ""for more than seven hours"" by labor inspectors, Pimot warns that it intends to build civil party in this file, which will necessarily trigger an investigation by an investigating judge. He plans to bring together the greatest possible number of his ex-colleagues in this procedure. ""The challenge is to bring together couriers who understood what Deliveroo is in terms of remuneration and working conditions, to go to the heart of the facts,"" he said. These announcements do not officially disturb the least in the Deliveroo world, whose representatives say they are ""confident on the legal outcome which will be given to this file"". It is true that on a legal level, the company has so far been reinforced in its positions. The Paris Court of Appeal thus, for the first time, confirmed in a judgment of November 9, 2017 the quality of a worker independent of a Deliveroo courier. Several other decisions, mostly men, go in the same direction. Jérôme Pimot himself was dismissed on February 1, alongside two other couriers, his requests for requalification in the classic employment contract of his contract with another platform, Tok Tok. He will appeal. On September 26, nine other couriers, who worked for Take Eat Easy, were dismissed. The judges decided that they were not competent to deal with relations between a business and self-employed, believing that the latter had to address the commercial court. This is the fourth time that Paris industrial tribunal has made a decision similar. ""It is a battle that is far from over,"" said Parisian lawyer Kevin Mention, who awaits a pruden -homal decision concerning 4 other Take Easy couriers, and will defend a hundred others. ""But the opinion of many law professionals is that this type of labor relations cannot be done under the status of independence. The courier is not independent, ""he insists. He gives as an example the situation that a Deliveroo courier has just explained to him: ""He is challenged by the company because he is not allowed to validate his orders just before arriving in the restaurant where he will look for them, as he usually does. ""We control it, we direct it, and there is clearly a notion of sanction behind,"" analyzes the lawyer. In addition, complementary procedures target Deliveroo. The Regional Equipment Directorate sent two minutes to the Paris prosecutor's office for ""concealed work"" and ""activity of public road transporter of goods without registration in the register"" specifically concerning 252 Deliveroo deliverers working on their scooters. A final report, for ""abusive recourse to fixed-term contracts"" at the company's headquarters, was also sent to the public prosecutor. ## URSSAF calculates the loss of social security contributions, justice will therefore have to choose between the current position of the judges, and that of the administration, which has meticulously built its files for several months. One thing is already certain: by using a precarious and paved workforce, failing to be really independent, rather than employees, digital platforms were exempt from the obligations that fall to employers over working time, the protection of the health and safety of employees, the accidents of work, the representative bodies, the payment of overtime, overtime, ""The prejudices for workers"" are listed in the minutes of the Labor Inspectorate: reduced health and retirement rights coverage, the task remuneration, blocked time slots, precariousness, difficulty in lodging and borrowing, etc. A recent study by the Ministry of Labor on ""the Economy of Platforms"" confirms that if this new type of employment offers ""a freer organization of working time"", it is also likely to ""degrade the quality of jobs by increasing precariousness and psychosocial risks"". Above all, by using self-employed entrepreneurs, Deliveroo pays much less social charges than using salaried delivery people: the company ""elected"" 964,000 euros in social contributions in 2015 and 5.46 million in 2016, according to a report submitted by URSSAF to the labor inspectorate on December 7, 2017. Because in addition to the labor inspectorate, URSSAF, responsible for collecting social contributions due by companies on wages, also has its say. It has also initiated a recovery procedure in at least one case. On December 7, 2016, his Nantes branch notified to Take It Easy an overall recovery of 718,000 euros, including almost 493,000 euros in settlement of social security contributions, 28,000 late penalties, and 197,000 euros in ""additional recovery for concealed work offense"". The liquidator of the bankrupt company disputes this recovery in justice. Have procedures also been launched by URSSAF for Deliveroo? It would seem logical, but a spokesperson for the administration does not wish to comment on the situation of a specific company "". However, she recalls that URSSAF seeks ""always to enforce the rights of employees"". She also believes that ""we are well in the same type of situation as in the case of Uber, it is the same type of relationship between employer and micro-entrepreneurs"". However, judging that Uber employed his drivers as conventional employees, while they are recorded as self -employed, the URSSAF has attacked the American company which shades the taxis. Two separate procedures are underway: the first in criminal, for hidden work, and the second before the Social Security Affairs Tribunal (TASS), to charge Uber 5 million euros in contributions not collected for three years. A year ago, the TASS agreed to Uber at first instance, canceling the recovery, but only for reasons of form. URSSAF called."	fr

"'Christianity as default is gone': The Rise of a non-Christian Europe I exaggerate a little. There are a few. But apart from the words of places or places, I see others come from Latin and have made the return trip. For example ""plow"" comes from ""chariot"" and comes from the Gauls Transalpin, but this word has become Curribus which means ""tank on two wheels"" in Latin, then became ""chariot"", (but not ""plow"" specifically).""Char"" also says ""Carro"" in Spanish and gives the car. It's the same root. In Spanish on the other hand we say ""arado"" (the thing that works the land, from the Latin arare) for ""plow"". Pliny the Younger already talks about tank races saying: ""Curribus"", plural of ""currus"" (the chariot) in 50 AD. It is a Gallic root spent in Latin, Latin which absorbed a little Gauls before spreading it everywhere where it was spoken. You have in the same way words that come from the Iberian Peninsula, then which have integrated into Latin, and which we use in French now. Like Gordo who gives Gurdus in Latin who gives fat in French, while before in Latin we said ""Magna"". The two etymologies have been kept to say different things. In short, you have a brewing, and there are words from the world before. But nobody speaks Gallic anymore. It is a Lanque that completely disappeared 2000 years ago. We speak Latin."	fr

Hanging, like her, at the central bar, he lets himself be swung, the pelvis forward, according to the braking and acceleration movements. A ""touer""? Not obvious, for the police, to surprise these men who take advantage of the strong crowds to sexually assault passengers. And yet, in the metro, ""predators"", there are ... According to two recent surveys, in Île-de-France, 43 % of the acts of serious violence against women take place in transport, and, in France, 87 % of travelers declare that they have already been victims of sexual harassment. To ""free up women's speech,"" awareness of witnesses, generally passive, and punish the authors, an information campaign and a single alert number for all island-de-France public transport were launched on Monday. Eighty police officers work in the brigade to combat transportation to transport safety (Blast). Every day, in groups of two or three, in civilian clothes, they mingle with travelers and travel the lines in all directions. In search of the flagrant offense. ""The main problem, until recently, was the flights to the draw,"" explains Commander Nicolas Monrepos, head of the security service at the Ile -de -France networks brigade. Now we see a lot of flights with violence. As for the rubbers, they represent 1 % of the blast activity: 31 arrests in 2017, a stable figure.

""All ages - 12 to 86 years old -, all socio -professional backgrounds, all nationalities. ""Costumes ties as jogging, but"" often the disjointed pockets, to caress "". They are focused on the north of the RATP network, lines 2, 4 and 13. ""They cross the most criminogenic sectors in Paris and are borrowed by a lot of tourists,"" comments Fabien, Maxime teammate. Even if there have been Europeans and also a Chinese, for more than ten years that I have been doing this job, the authors that I have arrested are for a very very large majority of North African origin. As for the victims, they are teenagers as retirees. And men too, more and more. Return to line 5, at the Republic station, where the alleged ""touer"" is still held behind the little girl. Fabien draws the alarm signal. The suspect descends immediately, discreetly followed by Maxime. ""The gentleman behind you ... Did you feel something?"" ""Asks Fabien at the Pré-Ado. But she has not noticed anything;No need to disturb her more. Meanwhile, the man with a cap ""is already on another victim"", in another train, warns Maxime by SMS. Except that this young woman either did not notice anything ... ""We do not appeal without the agreement of the victim, underline the police. Some do not want to file a complaint: not time, ashamed, afraid of meeting this man one day ... So we try to convince them: next time, the author may attack a kid ... while a complaint allows us to take his DNA, and he will be got there. ""**"" I adjusted my case alone ""** The spinning is finally abandoned: the suspect met a friend. But suddenly, in the crowded wagon, a man's voice rises. ""Oh, what takes you?"" Wrongs a passenger. Have you finished touching me there? In the reflection of the window, Fabien saw everything: a sixty -something man, his hand on the fly of a young man. ""For pride"", he will not file a complaint either. ""What I don't want is that he fiddles!"" He says. I set my case on my own. As for the author, he plunges his nose under his scarf and disappears without asking for his rest. ""You have to finish with this taboo!"" ""Exclaims Commissioner Amandine Matricon-Charlot, head of the Regional Transport Safety (SRT). ""Women wrongly think that there will be no consequences,"" she continues. For many, it is only an incivility. However, it is a sexual assault! The least violent, perhaps, but sometimes the most traumatic: frequently, when there was ejaculation, the victim moves, changes his habits. As for the authors, often they reoffend;It is therefore essential that they know that they risk 5 years in prison and 75,000 euros fine. ""It was at the police station on rue de l'Ezangile, in the 18th arrondissement, that the victims are taken. They are welcomed by specialized investigators from the Group of Sexual Incrections (GICS), created in 2015. Last year, the GICS worked on 218 complaints of sexual assault throughout the Ile-de-France, 128 authors were placed in police custody and 41 received prison terms. ""This shows that it is not in vain to file a complaint!"" Insists the commissioner. And if there is no police officer around, you can always press the alarm button, in the wagons or on the quays. RATP video surveillance images are kept 72 hours. Alert numbers (3117 per telephone, 31177 per SMS and application 3117) now make it possible to geolocate the victim and trigger an intervention by agents, 24 hours a day."	fr

Washington does not want labeling against junk food in the Alena countries, of course, and in return you get low. To answer your question: the economic theories on which the principles of free exchanges are founded presuppose rational economic agents, that is to say who know exactly what they buy and have the capacity of calculation to choose what is best for them. When you prevent people from making rational choices (either by hiding the information either by making it too complicated), the market can no longer play its role, the race for the production of the best product at the lowest cost is transformed into a race for the design of the best scam. Simple and informative labeling and non-messenger advertisements are necessary conditions for competition to play its role. You remove that and it's scam race, and everyone is losing (because instead of making efforts to produce useful things, we all find ourselves making efforts to scam the neighbor or avoid being ripped off by him).	fr

Will convenience store rice balls be smaller? Rice prices rise with the abolition of reduced rice production. If you think about it normally, the abolition of reduced rice production will be abolished → increased supply → lower prices. I've heard that because everyone wants to grow brand rice, but it seems that the rice will be in a field with quite a long way to go, and I feel like it will become polarized. It's also strange to think that it's extremely differentiated. It seems that be beef bowls have rice for beef bowls, curry for curry, and onogiri for onigiri, and there's a movement to produce rice in partnership with the restaurant industry. I think that it's not just cheap rice, but will they differentiate according to their purpose. Well, the restaurant industry is a person who buys rice for rice, but the order volume is stable, so I think there's a taste for it to work together. I think that this is quite different from milk, which is a huge amount of pricey item. In the medium to long term, there's probably a trend in the decline in rice consumption of households.

Changing the Mind to Martine by wholesale is a chicane between the pressed units, who believe that if we do not announce a referendum tomorrow morning that the cause is lost, and the units with the more patient and more strategic approach. If the chicane dates before Martine's arrival it is because of one of the only bloquist deputies to give her his support: Mario Beaulieu, another pressed. The thing is that in the last PQ race the members and indeed, the patient approach of JF Lisée while Martine finished good last (I excluded PSPP) which was to send a clear message on the strategy that the members chose. But Martine the bad loser incapable of respecting the decision of the PQ members decided to do the stubborn and to go and to push her strategy of pressed into the block by causing themselves downright the democratic decision that the members of the PQ took to take the slow approach of Lisée. So it all comes to play negatively in the PQ's courtyard and sabotage the good JFL blows at the start of the electoral year to bring the good old souvrainist chicane to the media and harm the entire movement. In the worst case, she only has to call a vote of confidence of the members of the block and if she wins she will have the legitimigated to stay and if she loses we will be able to turn the page and focus on the 2018 provincial electoral campaign.	fr

In short, I agree, it is easy to type on these autistic academics who see any marketing as a loss of the purity of research, and there is real inside, but one of the sides of the room - the other are boxes which systematically refuse to consider only to do the slightest serious research activity and which are reluctant in many cases."	fr

It was the social partners who imposed the condition, for fear of abuse. But that does not empty of substance the promise, which was talking about ""to change / develop"". Promise 2> We will allow all workers to be entitled to unemployment insurance. Craftsmen, independent traders, entrepreneurs, liberal professions, and farmers will have, such as employees, this arbitration protection: 800EU/month, only valid for legal liquidations and _Teux which had at least ""an annual benefit around 10,000 euros"" _ The risk of abuse was obvious, therefore it was absolutely certain that there would be a ""hard"" condition.liquidation is logical. It proves that the adventure is over and duly recorded at the CCI. The profit condition, however, is a real problem.

"7 out of 10 French people are for the end of the status of railway workers AJA I learn that the SNCF is disconnected from the French and world economy.> What bothers people with the special status that railway workers have is that they have better conditions than average. Still this same catchphrase continues and without any justification, therefore makes the list of the advantages and disadvantages of the railway workers. When you have done it, you can see that the balance is far from being as advantageous as that.> Is that they have these conditions payable by the rest of the population. No worries, from tomorrow you will pay your train tickets to the real cost and in exchange, you will no longer have to pay your tax part that finances the subsidies. Spoiler: You will lose a lot of money.> If a lambda company wants to grant life jobs or pay early pensions, no one will rear. The problem is when this company requires 13 billion annual grant to be able to grant this, otherwise they block everything (the country). It is like hospitals, they are partly paid by the State because it is a service of public utility. Look at the hospitals currently, they are on the verge of rupture, their working conditions are horrible and nothing moves because they cannot blocking (under penalty of seeing people die). The result is that the system collapses for lack of means (voluntarily), this will justify privatization and therefore you will have to pay much more expensive for care (hello the USA). It will be the same for the SNCF, the only thing that attracts people to them is the status, once removed you will not have enough staff or it will be under qualified, it will put the brothel and paf privatization. Result you will pay more expensive (hello Great Britain).> There inside, precisely, those who are seen as selfish ""Fuck you Got Mine"", these are the railway workers, not the rest of the population. You have a large majority which is convinced that they are breading animals and that the others are duty. They have been rally racking lies on railway workers for years, there is nothing objective in it. Edit Bonus: Questions any French, he will be against the reform of his profession to withdraw protections. As I say in the starting commentary, today is the railway worker, tomorrow it will be the dockers (who have just smashed cancer records), the day after tomorrow another public service etc in the end you will have only private which will cost an arm for a barely better quality of service (see less good)."	fr

The unemployed: The government unveils a new arsenal of sanctions - the Express Coup de Guele is we lively in France? A couple of modest people, having done little study, having average jobs lives quite correctly (vacation, travel, cars ...). Frankly, it swells me to read things where we would believe in modern slavery when it is enough to go outside to realize that we are still a very rich country. It is also enough to go to a coconut country or an ex coconut country to realize that the standard of living is significantly lower. So capitalism certainly has defects but I do not see the crushing of people in France ... OK, there are poor, but there are also a lot of people who flow it soft by touching the money that the others have earned. It's not going too much in your direction, right? We are in a country with lots of congestions, very correct wages (especially for medium jobs), very inexpensive hospital, gratos studies, well -paid unemployment for a long time, aid of all kinds for those who do not have a job, very weak direct taxes for most people and you come to present this like the misery fucking you are the ass and go to work a little.

Criteria for the purchase of a Tmon Conseil house is a bit side about your question but here it is: take your time!

You will take it for several decades of debt so take your time. The other piece of advice is to put all the devices in writing (equipped kitchen or I don't know) that are part of the sale. It’s 90% of the confusion afterwards. I won an oven there at 2000 balls. I really liked this conversation with the saleswoman: - But finally I will take my oven.- No Madam, you sold it to me with the apartment, unless you want to cancel the sales compromise.- But finally, if you don't give it to me, I don't have an oven.- Well yes. And then if I give it to you, I would not have an oven. Logical, right?	fr

Homeopaths charlatans!(Editorial in reaction of the gallery against alternative medicine published yesterday in Le Figaro.)> This is where studies on the DMT (present in Ayahuasca) seem to correlate with the testimonies of Amazonian shamans and natives no.

The DMT is part of the very long list of amines present in tiny quantities in human tissues, which are derivatives of the metabolism of amine acids and neurotransmitters, and which could or not have biological effects.

However, it is a taste of water in the budget. Just like the reduction of journalists is a taste of water in the state budget. The other is that they are privileged, and that there is no reason for that. Just like journalists, where is the justification for this minimal advantage as it is? As you seem to be for the end of the status of railway workers, you should logically be for the deletion of this reduction as well."	fr

7 out of 10 French people are for the end of the status of railway workers> This status is there for a reason. If this reason no longer exists, the status has no reason to be. If there is another problem requiring discussion and new system, it must be done separately. Otherwise we end up with status that does not correspond to anything, and if everyone does like that, it's the brothel and nobody finds themselves there. Because it is more useful to fight to reach the level of rights of your neighbor rather than jealous of those he owns. It seems to me that at a lot of devs (including me), we tend to turn to the Metallo Convention. Status level that has no reason to be in our trades, it would arise there, right?

'Christianity as default is gone': The Rise of a non-Christian Europe that is what I understood and no, it is not equivalent. Let's put (to simplify, it is not the real figures eh) that the indigenous population (non -immigrant) has a stable rate: 100 people of generation 1 give birth to 100 people from generation 2.. Let us put that the immigrant population is twice as fertile: 100 people from Gen1 give 200 people from Gen2. Let us also put that at each generation you add 100 frankly immigrant people who make two children per person (Cad 4 per woman). Let us count young people from immigration generation by generation: ------------------------------------ scenario 1: the descendants of immigrants adopt in a generation the native habits and start to have 1 child per person (= 2 per woman).1. We start with 100 Gen1 2. Immigration: 100 new Gen1 arrives. Reproduction: 200 Gen2. Total 100+200 = 300 3. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 200 Gen3 + 200 Gen2. Total 100+200+200 = 500 4. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 200 Gen4 + 200 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+200+200+200 = 700 5. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 200 Gen5 + 200 Gen4 + 200 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+200+200+200 = 900 There are 200 people more per generation.---------------------- Scenario 2: the descendants of immigrants adopt keep the same growth rate.1. We start with 100 Gen1 2. Immigration: 100 new Gen1 arrives. Reproduction: 200 Gen2. Total 100+200 = 300 3. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 400 Gen3 + 200 Gen2. Total 100+200+400 = 700 4. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 800 Gen4 + 400 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+800+400+200 = 1500 5. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 1600 Gen5 + 800 Gen4 + 400 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+1600+800+400+200 = 3100 Growth is exponential and double at each generation.----------------- In both cases the population believes, but at very, very different rhythms. The question is whether the deconversions are progressing at the same rate.	fr

No. Proof by figures. If we deported as much in France we would have minimum 20% less instantly criminals, and given the recurrence rates probably around 50% in the long term. The majority of crimes are the work of a small number of people impossible to integrate or reintegrate.> Who are false and from propaganda aimed at destabilizing the EU which is true and sourced by official data or articles of Swedish newspapers.> Typically 18-20k/raw per year I would say so you're not far from my estimates. Typically a minimum wage. As I say from the start.> The problem of lack of jobs remains largely linked to automation, and the hard refusal of the right to overcome full employment with allowances The problem comes from international competition for a third party (labor cost), lack of innovation in France (obsolescence) and finally automation for a third party, but the fact that the criminals will not want to work for a minimum wage. The far left countries are even more in shit than the others, because you simply cannot spin allowances while continuing to produce enough value to ensure the sustainability of redistribution. Your allowance solution for all cannot work with massive immigration.>> YAKA remove poverty! No one has ever thought about it!>> The fact is that in a government level we have the means to do so. No. Nor can you delete crime. We already have a system in total bankruptcy unable to provide for his needs, which is forced to borrow more and more to fill his deficits and whose imbalances are only worse. Above all, by mobilizing hundreds of billions for poverty you scare capital and investment elsewhere, and thereby you put in danger of future generations.> And we had virtually almost fully erased great poverty in the French country in the 1960s. Following a great period of rigor with de Gaulle, without RMI, without family immigration, without demographic imbalance, while China was only a dwarf and that Africa was 5 times less populated. Everything has changed.> ""Relative poverty"" (vis -à -vis your neighbors or the country) will always exist, but we can end sustainably in housing, food and basic needs in the country. Not when you welcome 250,000 more people per year.> However, ambient corruption in right -wing governments and billions sent to employers, as well as the neoliberal ideologist (declaring that taxes must be demolished, the minimum wage called into question, that everyone must die to the task to win the slightest euro and that retirement and paid holidays must die);are based on this objective. Whenever you learn that your APL is planed by 10 € more and that your heating bill rises by € 200/year because GDF has been privatized, this is this problem. The APLs did not exist in the 1960s and heating represented around 7% of the household budget as today (source: *energy consumption: as many fuel expenses as in domestic energy *). The billions are taken from small businesses, much more than in the 1960s where the tax burden was lower for craftsmen and SMEs. Large companies save themselves yes but it is one of the effects of globalization and the EU.

'Christianity as default is gone': The Rise of a non-Christian Europe that is what I understood and no, it is not equivalent. Let's put (to simplify, it is not the real figures eh) that the indigenous population (non -immigrant) has a stable rate: 100 people of generation 1 give birth to 100 people from generation 2.. Let us put that the immigrant population is twice as fertile: 100 people from Gen1 give 200 people from Gen2. Let us also put that at each generation you add 100 frankly immigrant people who make two children per person (Cad 4 per woman). Let us count young people from immigration generation by generation: ------------------------------------ scenario 1: the descendants of immigrants adopt in a generation the native habits and start to have 1 child per person (= 2 per woman).1. We start with 100 Gen1 2. Immigration: 100 new Gen1 arrives. Reproduction: 200 Gen2. Total 100+200 = 300 3. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 200 Gen3 + 200 Gen2. Total 100+200+200 = 500 4. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 200 Gen4 + 200 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+200+200+200 = 700 5. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 200 Gen5 + 200 Gen4 + 200 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+200+200+200 = 900 There are 200 people more per generation.---------------------- Scenario 2: the descendants of immigrants adopt keep the same growth rate.1. We start with 100 Gen1 2. Immigration: 100 new Gen1 arrives. Reproduction: 200 Gen2. Total 100+200 = 300 3. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 400 Gen3 + 200 Gen2. Total 100+200+400 = 700 4. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 800 Gen4 + 400 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+800+400+200 = 1500 5. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 1600 Gen5 + 800 Gen4 + 400 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+1600+800+400+200 = 3100 Growth is exponential and double at each generation.----------------- In both cases the population believes, but at very, very different rhythms. The question is whether the deconversions are progressing at the same rate.	fr

"Urban planning: Who do we give the keys to the city?** Three to four slopes ** So today, who manufactures the city? When, as Emmanuel Macron said, then Minister of Economy, in Mipim 2016, ""public money is rare but liquidity is abundant"", would it have those who have these liquidity who have become masters of the game?""The public authorities are perhaps a little financially weakened,"" admits Etienne Marcot, but not at all on the legal level. Politicians have never had so many law instruments at its disposal to prevail its urban vision. What is happening afterwards is his responsibility. ""Elected officials therefore have a power. Admittedly, it can first be used to prohibit: no too high buildings, no building without parking ... or to be forced: all the white aspects, all the roofs with four slopes ... There is no shortage of rules, far from it and, proof that inflation in the field does not guarantee anything, ""all the regulations have never prevented a failed building,"" said the architect Yves Lion one day. Conversely, wanting to make money in real estate does not necessarily mean that you have nothing in the brain. Investors and promoters have expanded their profession to the point of being able to provide all the elements of the urban, including public space. Should we then give them the keys to the city? In any case, this is the reproach that was made in the Re-Invent Paris competition. In this consultation launched in 2015, the City of Paris offered 23 places for sale. Investors and promoters were invited to compete to win the interesting sites. But beware, no question of coming only with your checkbook. The city requested a project for each place, carried by a team containing architects and urban planners, of course, but also landscapers, experts in sustainable development, urban agriculture and very often, artists. Who is the chief in this troop? Whoever has money or the one who has ideas? Philippe Chiambaretta, who participated in the competition with Hines and Eurosic investors, affirms thatconceptor and financed rather at the same level, one who needs the other and vice versa.""The classic scheme in which the mayor says to himself:"" I make plans, I divide my land in lots that I put on sale at best saying with an architectural competition behind "", it is not terrible. With re-inventing Paris, Paris will not sell land to the one who pays the most but the one who will think the most. ”In fact, the first edition resulted in an abundance of urban creativity as we had not seen for a long time. But caused just as many criticisms. The remuneration of architects was at the good will of the investor and a number of project managers have phosphorus for free. The corporation did not fail to complain. In addition, even if re-inventing Paris was an outstanding commercial showcase for promoters, they believe that participation in the party cost them millions. They took charge of the cost of this mega-competition that the city of Paris could not have been able to offer. Since then, the rules of the game of consultations of the same type - on the metropolis or the Seine - have been a little clarified. But still, is it normal for the public power to ask the private sector to have ideas in its place? Would the authorities legitimized by democracy have renounced to manufacture the city? Olivier Malapert, architect, believes that what Paris re-inventing is that elected officials ""do not have infused science. When public power recognizes that it has incompetence, it is good. ""It is far away from the time when Jacques Chirac bursed: ""The architect of the Halles, it's me! Philippe Chiambaretta wants to recognize ""the act of humility of a city that says not knowing, for example, what the mobility of the future will be. But when a mayor says that what he wants to keep is a social mix, he is in politics. """	fr

An “abandoned” Eurostar in the Valenciennois? The more huge trains' maintenance cost. The cancellation of certain euros (called NOLs planned to circulate north of London, the latest branches built of TMSTs, delivered in 1996) is due to the facts that: - the most recent oars of a series are often the first to go to breakage (because generally it is the last which are renovated and find themselves being the most obsolete when we decide to stop renovations)Very first TGV trains which date from 1978 but not the last release in 1985. - The Eurostar have particularities, they are very long (14 cars) and cannot be coupled in multiple unit, in addition to being cut in the middle (which is useless outside the tunnel under the sleeve) and their floor is high (91 cm because it is the height of the quays in England, while in France it is still 58Cars They could do Bordeaux-Marseille services for example), they cannot circulate under 1,500 volts in France, so that prohibits them from access to the south of France.- All of this helped put them to the rebuilding, and the arrival of the Siemens Velao to replace them did not help. As written at the beginning, these oars were originally to ensure trains north of London, but since other series of trains were chosen to make these trains, putting them in the rebuilding. And no one will get wet to buy 20 -year -old trains, very complex and dear to maintenance. In the same category I name Japan, renowned for its disposable TGVs, the oldest in service have been since 1997. \\**Outside RER network which has high quays for certain lines*.	fr

Choosing a bike to go to TAF Welcome to the club, here are my tips from 15 years of practice: * No sports bike has fine tire: too fragile and uncomfortable.* Ideal at first is a used bicycle.* Take Kevlar reinforcement tires * OPTS for solid equipment: new bikes at € 99, ​​it's stew.* Do not neglect lighting: the dynamo of hub may seem a luxury, but you will never have a light problem again.* Clean and fat your channels every 15 days.* Learn how to manage the speeds (Hint: If you have the large tray and large gable at the same time, it's bad) ... or better, opts for a hub: Alfine 9 or 11 * thinks well about rain clothes: for my part I have a kind of orange waxed canvas poncho + onbottes (Dutch material) ... You have to be sufficiently covered, but maintain adequate ventilation.* If you want to last, be always on the alert and prepare to be treated as a harmful element.* Use a quality padlock and always attach your bike to a fixed point.	fr

"In Mayotte violence takes dramatic proportions you have not forgotten to insult me ​​one last time of xenophobic by chance ???> And that's strictly what does. Besides, you take the opportunity to make propaganda for your little theory of Xenophobic. It's not a theory, it's reality. This is precisely what you don't understand. There is no question of thinking about this or that is a question of facts.> She is very good. Another personal attack, without proof. In short, if you have fun comfort yourself in this idea that I think all foreigners are bad guys. It corresponds to your Manichean vision - either you like all foreigners and you are cool or you don't like them all and you are xenophobic> It's good that you put your finger on your Islamophobia. You assume that unlike other religious, Muslims are all fundamentalist who take the text at the foot of the letter. Why are you talking about my alleged Islamophobia when I see an idea and not an idea? And yes I know they are not all fundamentalists thank you. However, it is part of the value of Islam and Muslims live according to Islam. And I don't see how to worry about it and pointing out is xenophobic. To believe that pointing out that Islam is homophobic is in fact Islamophobic. Strange right?> Precisely, you don't admit it, it's written black on white just above. And that's why you are Islamophobic. Yes because I understand this in the same way as: ""Nazism is anti-semite. So not all Nazis are anti-Semites species of anti-Nazis"" you defend an intolerant ideology because practitioners of this ideology do not practice all these intolerant acts. Either, as I told you I know it depends on everyone. But hey we are not going to expect the PC to claim to claim more liberalism> but of course, you have enough to demonstrate that all the Muslims are homophobic. Once again we come to the limits of what you think is arguments. I just presented that the ideology which serves as a base for Muslims is homophobic. And that countries applying this ideology as rules of life or as the main religion are also homophobic and there are laws in this sense. You conclude what you want but I did not conclude anything, you can reread> We can browse your history, it is full of xenophobic positions. Not so much. Finally for you not to be xenophobic it is to emit absolutely no criticism of people so yes necessarily my history must seem rigorously xenophobic to you. It remains to be seen if this is the opinion of everyone (in any case not that of the dictionary)> and that does not change that your conclusions are xenophobic. Given that each time you understand nothing about what you are told and that you debit your speech without thinking, it's a bit painful to chat with you. Especially when you think that your instrumentalizations can be called arguments. But if I have zero and not valid arguments, why don't you destroy them? Why don't you show me that there is no difference between people. Why don't you show me that all countries share the same culture? And that all cultures are equal? Surely because you can't. So you attack me on the emotional level (you are bad xenophobic) either on me (my history). I ask you to debate ideas, and give me arguments. I have brought documents that can go in my sense, in turn> we, call it instrumentalizing sources and it has nothing to do with it. How so ? I have not instrumentalized there. I took the raw info and I had it c/c especially in relation to Hofstede> It is LKA cherry on the cake this conclusion. How is this conclusion the icing on the cake? What am I saying about it? I think you really have a problem seeing evil everywhere. You see the world under the spectrum that minorities are to be protected or are victims all the time I have the impression. Suddenly I have the impression that highlighting the twists of these minorities (at the cultural level, value, religion) makes you uncomfortable or creates in you a violent feeling because you have to defend them."	fr

To avoid a shortage of butter supply, the import limit will be 13,000 tons in the new fiscal year. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is providing subsidies to protect dairy farmers, and designated organizations are limiting production and maintaining milk prices. Nothing will change as long as we do this. The production of raw milk is set at the very least every year to prevent milk prices from falling, so if an unexpected increase in demand or supply occurs, we cannot prepare it in advance. The pre-made season is only winter when demand is circulating, so if it's not enough, you can't make it unless you import it. If they give away the remaining amount, the milk prices will drop, so dairy cows and dairy farmers won't make any profit. However, because milk prices are maintained, dairy farmers' incomes will plateau and end up leaving farming, so the situation is currently in progress. I think the idea is that even imported products have stable quality, so there is no need to process them in Japan.	ja

'Christianity as default is gone': The Rise of a non-Christian Europe that is what I understood and no, it is not equivalent. Let's put (to simplify, it is not the real figures eh) that the indigenous population (non -immigrant) has a stable rate: 100 people of generation 1 give birth to 100 people from generation 2.. Let us put that the immigrant population is twice as fertile: 100 people from Gen1 give 200 people from Gen2. Let us also put that at each generation you add 100 frankly immigrant people who make two children per person (Cad 4 per woman). Let us count young people from immigration generation by generation: ------------------------------------ scenario 1: the descendants of immigrants adopt in a generation the native habits and start to have 1 child per person (= 2 per woman).1. We start with 100 Gen1 2. Immigration: 100 new Gen1 arrives. Reproduction: 200 Gen2. Total 100+200 = 300 3. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 200 Gen3 + 200 Gen2. Total 100+200+200 = 500 4. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 200 Gen4 + 200 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+200+200+200 = 700 5. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 200 Gen5 + 200 Gen4 + 200 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+200+200+200 = 900 There are 200 people more per generation.---------------------- Scenario 2: the descendants of immigrants adopt keep the same growth rate.1. We start with 100 Gen1 2. Immigration: 100 new Gen1 arrives. Reproduction: 200 Gen2. Total 100+200 = 300 3. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 400 Gen3 + 200 Gen2. Total 100+200+400 = 700 4. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 800 Gen4 + 400 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+800+400+200 = 1500 5. Immigration: 100 Gen1. Reproduction: 1600 Gen5 + 800 Gen4 + 400 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+1600+800+400+200 = 3100 Growth is exponential and double at each generation.----------------- In both cases the population believes, but at very, very different rhythms. The question is whether the deconversions are progressing at the same rate.	fr

How the work of Adam Smith was diverted to serve wild capitalism> There are exactly 0 economists (including Marxists) who thinks that free and non -distorted competition is bad. Most heterodox economists, including Marxists, criticism of the CPP because it is not feasible and its proposal under the pretext of positive analysis, then turned into a normative proposal.(Basically at the beginning the liberals We say describe the economy with competition without regulation, then it extrapolated positive consequences. Following that many postulates of the Hypothetico deductive method were called into question, it then took free and not fausée competition, or CPP, it is similar, as ideal to be achieved.) A lot of economists challenge the possibility of doing it orto deregulate the markets. Many economists want, in certain sectors to reduce competition situation, especially for public monopolies. And moreover, even some liberals abandon CPP's hypothesis for a more realistic analysis in oligopolistic competition.> And you will find almost no economist who will tell you that globalization is bad nobody will say it as it is, but economists will show the negative externalities of the last wave of globalization (since globalization is analyzed as a differentiated phenomenon according to eras).> If you are one and you think that the happiness of a Chinese or a Vietnamese has less than that of a French or a Norwegian, you just understood nothing. It's so simplified. I will not deepen myself, but it is not because the BRIICS know a development that globalization is not a problem, even in the countries which are experiencing strong growth. There is the ecological problem, of course, but also problems related to competition and the fact that it pushes to deflation of wages in a context of globalized competition in the labor market. The Marx reserve army could be updated for eg. At the time of Keynesiano Fordian capitalism, we had the possibility of increasing national wages but it is more and more complicated with the opening of customs borders. The increase in wages can quickly be felt in deficit in the trade balance.> We must stop confusing 'economist' with 'asshole of American libertarian'.

7 out of 10 French people are for the end of the status of railway workers I would not want to be alarmist but (yes therefore I am), the wash of neo-liberal brain is advancing great at the moment. If the subject polarizes so much the French is that it is extremely revealing of the current mentality where we prefer to level the working conditions on the altar of a so -called crisis which affects those who do not have much and who are ready to save this little step. If we look at the current state of the world and France, we see that there have never been so many riches in circulation and have never been captured by as few people as today. Not to mention the technological and structural advances that constantly increase general productivity (capital gains discreetly captured by a minority), we see that the majority of French people are now convinced that the crisis is the fault of the fainters who have too many advantages. At the same time, the majority of French people think to work long enough and quite productive by rejecting the other. The other today is the railway worker, tomorrow it will be any status or profession having working conditions not so bad as that. Soon, the vast majority of employees in France will have working conditions and life below that of previous generations. We will then see who will be blamed, the old generations who have done anything or the employers who have never been so rich? I have in the idea that small old people will go to the scaffold or will be forced to live in the street long before the elite ends up dropping some crumbs to the people.	fr

'Christianity as default is gone': The Rise of a non-Christian Europe> Nothing that looks closely or far from a caliphate in France. Because you think the caliphate they looked like caliphate? Must stop the fantasy for two seconds, the Arab conquests is an extreme minority of conquerors resulting from a specific ethnic group (~ the Arabs of Hejaz) which is imposed by war in countries mainly populated by different and very varied ethnic groups and religions. In fact it is very similar to the barbaric conquests in Western Europe, the Franks are Germanic warriors converted to arianism which go to the conquest of an essentially Gallo-Roman country and still strongly attached to polytheistic cults. Then the Muslim system is much more flexible than the Christian system vis -à -vis other religions: it will take centuries for the Islamization of the Machrek to be effective when it is a region which is at the heart of Muslim space! Far from the fantasies of an aggressive Islam, historical reality is quite different. Just ask yourself, how is it that there are so many Eastern Christians in countries that have been Muslim for 1400 years? Finally, the reality of the Muslim presence in France is a subject which in the middle of the site in French historiography. We are frankly in a period when it is difficult to rule on the subject because the discoveries are linked.20 years ago we thought that the Arabs only made raids in France, now we realize that septimania was under direct influence of Muslim powers and that there were well -established colonies, and that many places in the South have Muslim cemeteries that date from that time. We all know the battle of Poitiers, but we forget that Poitiers is still really high in France. You already almost crossed half of the country to arrive in Poitiers. In short, the ve-viiie century is still a very little known period in our history, we will have to wait a little longer to better fix historical knowledge.	fr

After several general strikes having largely proven their nuisance power, but also their revolutionary means of contesting (before it was via arms, we killed representatives of the State. Bof Bof). And well appear that after all these episodes, strangely, we see a lot of social measures being taken by successive governments. As if the social and democratic pressure exerted by a political party had an effect. And besides, concomitantly, since the 1980s and the ideological defeat of ""USSR"" type communism we are witnessing a big step back on these social achievements.

A people who die, it dies for a long time I cannot say that I am a sovereignist, say that I am trying to be convinced and to be proposed a project that joins me but I think that I can answer some of your questions. What are the real reasons that animate the sovereignist movement? I see a very big one. Roc and Quebec do not form a united people. In fact they are two peoples with large differences living in the same country. The biggest difference is cultural. We do not have the same culture at all, we do not have the same references. The rock has no idea what is happening on the Quebec music scene, does not listen to our films or our TV. They do not read our books either, do not follow the same personalities as us. The reverse is also true. I think the only common point is that we love hockey. We don't really have an emotional link with the British monarchy. We are more on the left than the rock. Quebec detaches itself a lot from religion, becomes more secular. I'm not even talking about the language that makes Quebecers and Canadians are two isolated groups that each have their own media which even increase the difference between the two peoples. You were talking about Saguenay and Gaspésie, Greater Montreal. These regions may form distinct groups but they have a common link with the rest of Quebec. They are more a subgroup than a separate group. A similar link does not exist with the rest of Canada. When Gord Downie is dead, I did not feel anything and I imagine that the rock would give a damn about the death of one of our local stars. I could have continued but I have to look into something else. Why separate. One of the reasons is that Quebecers are able to judge what is good for them. Currently, for major laws to be adopted (such as medical aid to die, abortion, etc.), it is necessary to support people (the deputies of the rock) who probably never set foot in Quebec, nor even consumed Quebec media and culture, which have no idea of ​​what is going on here. To move forward, the Quebec people must constantly ask another people very different from us in terms of values ​​and culture. Economic point of view. Quebec would also be very busy. We are one of the most developed economies in the world. To separate does not detract from our economic institutions, our industries. There will be a period of uncertainty as there have been in Russia, Germany and which will arrive in Great Britain. I am convincing myself.

"Bordeaux: Muscled confrontation between students and police it was 8 p.m., firm college at 9:30 p.m. So technically they had the right to be in the premises, especially since they were only discussing.

But this is not the case, the university completely closes the debate of the selection, which is not a surprise when you know the positions of the president of the University of Bordeaux, because each university apparently has the choice to apply or not the selection, and therefore the students seek to change their minds. You will admit that violence in the face of peaceful people is not correct ... even if they do not want to move. Students on the spot reported the following facts: - The students were in human chain at the top, sitting - The CRS surrounded them, cornered against the outdoor wall - the CRS typed for a quarter of an hour - ""When they calmed down, they did things of P*te, like they tear you away from your bag, throw it two meters in front of you, ask you to pick it up, while you are looking."	fr

"Making insurance: a flagship promise of Macron emptied of its substance> It borders on the title fake, the content is not as clear. Oh come on. I want us to defend his darling in politics, no harm to that, but do not care about the world ... We go from a promise of universal unemployment insurance to a slight increase in the number of cases where we can benefit from it, in a truncated manner as well with the amount allocated as the duration ... Yes the promise of Macron is emptied of his substance. As a resigning employee, to benefit from the unemployment allowance, in addition to the condition of the uninterrupted 5 years, it will therefore be necessary to have a project which requires professional training, and necessarily that this project corresponds to the needs of the labor market, implied, if you are leaving to do a job in tension very well, if you go to realize your dream of becoming a radio host, since there is not specially shortage of animators, VTFF. If you want to become an electrician since it requires training it goes, if you want to become a community manager you can go and make yourself see. As an independent, it's worse. Already, almost all of the micro-entrepreneurs are not affected, since they are rarely in liquidation. While the measure had been presented as planned for them. It also dismisses all those who want to close their box proper, rather than organizing their bankruptcy and by fucking the cock to their suppliers. In addition, an annual profit around 10,000 euros at the same time as compulsory liquidation, good ... in general when you liquidate it is that you make losses, not profit. And all that for a ridiculous 800 balls per month for 6 months: barely more than the RSA+APL (finally ... as long as they still exist it is true) for a ridiculously weak period to turn around. Pitiful. Frankly at this price as much to contribute to a private insurer ... Yes the concept of ""universal unemployment insurance"" and the beautiful speeches of Macron as ""in today's society we can no longer reserve unemployment for employees only when the forms of work become multiple Blabla there is more work for life blablabla"" have completely disappeared from the arbitrated system.> In 3-4 years, an assessment can completely decide to change the thresholds/income, on the basis of the real impact.

Let us put that the immigrant population is twice as fertile: 100 people from Gen1 give 200 people from Gen2. Let us also put that at each generation you add 100 frankly immigrant people who make two children per person (Cad 4 per woman). Let us count young people from immigration generation by generation: ------------------------------------ scenario 1: the descendants of immigrants adopt in a generation the native habits and start to have 1 child per person (= 2 per woman).1.

About twenty ex-deputies of the block demand the departure of Martine Ouellet at worst let the members settle which is right. I am cool that Martine puts all-in independence. Anyway returned everyone to ignore it in Ottawa, we get it on it and there is not one of the kinds of 50 deputies of the PLQ or 15 deputies of the NPD who says a word. The block serves as a guard dog but no one listens to it. The problems of sharing power in a confederation and abuse of this one interest not at all young and older. I will never vote something other than the block, or like a rhino or an independent, bouerice and its gang can eat the mard. Also go with a bang if it's the same as it happens. It will make a less sovereignist party less, with who died there will be just the PQ and qs .. I find it sad the same as the death of the Bloc cause of laughter and insults, it is a piece of our history which leaves and the block deserved to leave with honor ..	fr

"You are caught in the act of manipulation or fake news (Bannon speech at the FN) agree with you on the merits. In particular these accusations of racism at all VAC had the effect, for 30 years, of stopping the debate however necessary on ""sensitive"" subjects such as immigration. On the other hand:> democracy vacillates, not because of said populist Marine Le Pen and Bannon are themselves specialists in these manipulations. When they are accused, they answer that they only adopt the techniques of their opponents. It is largely true;For example when we see the ""decoders"" criticizing the FN, it's ridiculous, it's an ideological pharmacy against another. But it depends on adversaries, and often the FN is rather worse (for example during the Le Pen - Macron debate). In any case, the former Bannon, Trump, is an absolute disaster in the matter, insulting, lying, manipulating like no one before him. On Reddit on the_donald, which is more or less directly a creation of Bannon, and whose little interest in truth is seen daily. To say that we will not talk about banners anymore in two days is to forget a little quickly that we will only speak of Trump for still years or even decades, depending on the level of damage that he will continue to inflict. In short, all that to say that I rather agree on the substance, but that I think that you have to be careful not to make things make things great. To denounce the manipulation wherever it is, including when it affects ""political adversaries"" is absolutely essential for democracy to work. Responding to manipulation manipulation, on the other hand, it can only lead to the generalized disintegration of society, and it is happening.

This sentence does not make sense. Influence on what? > If I may have you traveled outside Europe? No but serious, what is this question. > We notice that people are similar in every way on a human level, we share the same feelings, we are human. Do you do a cling competition? Sorry you call it arguments. > But when you observe more precisely the functioning of society you note that people have very different ways of organizing and thinking, which is cultural. And some cultures can be confronted in different points and then. It's just a sentence in the air that is strictly useless. > Okay, the same if you want to formulate it like that, let's go. I consider that there are more compatible countries with each other than others, due to the differences between the population. If for you it means that there are some that I don't like it, then let's go it's you who don't stop criticizing and wanting to make a classification. > And there are bad ones. It's the same as everything there are both sides I will not say that it is that positive or negative, however you only comment on the negative. Chance, I don't believe it. > It's a double problem yes. Religious and social. And it took time in France too but I know that mentalities changes because the young people who defined themselves Muslims from their birth does not allow themselves to be done because they are in a society which encourages freedom of religion, unlike many others we do not define these or that of birth, we are defined as such, it is much later that we define ourselves, the minimum being to have acquired. I don't see strictly or you want to come. > It is possible that you felt that I generalized I did not feel it, I noticed it when you read you and it does not date from today. You systematically reduce the same xenophobic and Islamophobic catchphrases. > I would like to know your opinion on the thing. That you tell me concretely what you think. If you think that all societies are equal, if the values ​​are equivalent, if you think that mixing people have no social consequences, etc ... I just think that this classification is a stupid approach that does not make a lot of use. Societies are all the fruit of exchange and mixture, to be for or against it is absolutely no meaning. I think that we have something else to fuck than this base on ethnic origins to move forward, what matters is acts, that you are a French or senagalais asshole does not change the problem, an asshole must be treated as such independently of its origin. > You absolutely be right to point out. I could have taken them as an example also but the subject did not focus on them (we would have talked about Chechnya at the limit). Otherwise yes I condemn them just as much. All religions make people make people, all, Christianity and others. You should do it with what I never see you do, that's why we can talk about phobia. It is always on Muslims or Africans. I see homophobes as homophobic, not like Muslims or participants in the Manif pour tous. It is much more effective in dealing with the problem. > In addition it can be seen clearly because they have a treatment of homosexuals just as intolerant and no I am not obsessed with Muslims. We only debate. I am not obsessed with each subject that I approach you always approach the same subject with the same targets while claiming the opposite. Do it with everyone and we can talk about it. You have passed I don't know how many comments to explain to myself that Muslims were the most awful in the world, you even theorized it, we can speak of obsessions. I am against this kind of speech, I attack it when seeing them, you are not the only one I answer. > Yeah it's clear. But hey I try to point out as I can only if we leave the benefit of doubt for an ideology why not for another? By what some organized the final solution and not others. Not to mention their ideology which is only a set of theorization of racism and other fadies on the upper race. It has nothing to do with it. > Well yet it is a false question because we can say that Nazism is based on the hierarchy of races while Islam no here is. > But maybe you understand what I mean. No, not really, I don't think you will find an example that works. > Waiting Christians or Muslims to be tolerant of homosexuals for example, while their religion indicates the opposite. I do not see how it is supposed to arrive unless people abandon religion, and still it can remain impregnated for a long time in society I shit on religions but it would be dishonest to say that part of the religious has not evolved and that some are not able to adapt to an open and tolerant world. If this was not the case, given the number of believers, we would be permanently at war and the planet would be on fire and blood. > I would like to know your opinion on the thing. That you tell me concretely what you think. If you think that all societies are equal, if the values ​​are equivalent, if you think that mixing people have no social consequences, etc ... As I said above, I think this question makes no sense and is useless. If we focus on France, I do not think that real problems are linked to immigration whether near or far. It is just a cloth that we wave to occupy the gogos so that they do not seek the real cause of their problems. And it is cause are linked to the structure and values ​​of our society. > Let's say that it does not concern me more than that because I am not personally confronted, but otherwise yes it can concern me especially if they are discriminated against because of a religion because what I don't like is religions is a bit of an confessions of instrumentalization. I would believe you the day when I would actually see you using as much energy to unzip other religions as Islam. Besides, it would undoubtedly allow you that the problem is religion and that they must all be fought as a whole, not by taking them one by one and by making a classification between them. > I especially support on this point to demonstrate that there are ways to think and organize different society around the world, which influences the levels of tolerance and there have been advances and backs in all regions of the world. > We could talk about tolerance towards the Jews also for example. As countries that systematically refuse Israeli passports I think that a country that commits war crimes and does not respect resolutions must be punished. Israeli is a nationality, not a religion, I do not think that these countries accept Muslims more than the Jews from the moment they have an Israeli passport. To say that it is an intolerance towards the Jews is to make a more than doubtful shortcuts.	fr

Are Women Paid Less Than Men for the Same Work?> One might also wonder why we also value the trades that women choose, who are very beneficial to society, even if all this is true. I do not think that we devalue their professions more than we devalue the male professions voluntarily, this is a case by case and you must be able to find examples of valued/devalued profession for the two sex. A plumber will not be valued just like a hairdresser will not be. A nurse will be valued as well as a policeman will be.(I voluntarily gave jobs or both sexes can be present but are mainly gendered in collective thought) on the other hand we can say that the predominantly female trades pay less in a good part of the cases. And I think (personal opinion huh, if you don't agree I will be delighted to discuss it), that it is linked to two things. The danger of the profession for a part (accidents/deaths at work are very mostly male). And the capitalist world. The professions linked to culture (female dominance) produce less value (in euro, not in social/educational or other value) than the trades linked to industry (male dominance) for example.	fr
