"Cédric Villani - We are not lying March 24, 2018 There is above all a complete misunderstanding of your interlocutors on the whole problem. They make two major errors of reasoning: 1) The algos used are expert systems (If then with all of the cases coded in hard) while in reality we have Deep Learning algos trained on millions of cases which make an ""instinctive"" decision - in view of my experience based on thousands of cases, I would have to do that. There will never be a dev in charge of saying ""In this case we kill the baby, but in this case we go for the car"" 2) that the world is deterministic. Even when thinking about it, impossible to predict how the environment will react. If I think, does the car behind me manage to brake? Is it an autonomous vehicle elsewhere, in which case it can react better? What about people's reflexes around? In short, the question will never arise in ""I must kill X or Y"", it will always be ""if I do this there is such risk, if this one there is such other risk"", and these risks cannot be calculated precisely, it will be right, as said above, an ""instinctive"" reaction built by the accumulated experience of the software. In short, you preach in the desert."	fr

"At the origins of Crispr the most interesting part, I think, is as follows:> Crispr is not a technological DIY, it is the implementation of a natural phenomenon. A Silicon Valley engineer said Jennifer Doudna: ""Give me any problem and I will invest $ 10 million and then hire the best team and I will solve the problem.». Does this apply to Crispr? Probably not, because, as she explains in the conclusion of her book, this discovery ""was inspired by a research motivated by curiosity towards natural phenomena. The technology that we have created did not ask ten of twenty million dollars to be developed, but it required a in -depth understanding of chemistry and biology of bacterial adaptive immunity, a subject that may seem unrelated to genes. This is only an example of the importance of basic research - the continuation of scientific research in order to understand our natural world - and its relevance in the development of new technologies. I already had this debate there with colleagues researchers. They take you out of the GFP (Green Fluorescent Proteins), taxols (natural extract of the IF used in chemo) or CRISPR/CAS9 as examples of discoveries of basic research which have concrete and important applications. The problem, as I argue each time, is that it was never the discoverer who had the idea. It is not a sofa/carpenter who discovered the CRISPR, it is very brilliant European microbiologists but for whom the idea of ​​a practical application did not even touch the mind. It is clearly missing in France, in fundamental research, engineers dedicated to patenting and the implementation of discoveries, which would make it possible to effectively finance fundamental research through operating licenses of these patents. But tell the researchers and most of them go up direct on their big horses, ""I do science, môssieur, not trade"". While complaining that their budget is reduced because the product of their discoveries is exploited by the private sector."	fr

Your experiences in a hair salon I rarely go to the hairdresser because - if I had to spend 40 € each time I want to make a touch -up, I should file for bankruptcy - I rarely come out of the result, anyway. So even if it means having to cut behind and feeling like having spoiled money, as much as I cut/colors myself. I also cut my guy's hair (who, suddenly, has not screwed up in a hair salon for 6 years - he hates that) I go to the hairdresser when I want to do something that really comes out of my abilities (lately, a scan), but it's max once a year. I am clearly not hairdresser but at least I know my hair and how they react, while the hairdressers who start by washing your skull twice in a row and brushing you with hell: perfect, you have returned my hair in a state that will never happen naturally, suddenly as soon as I get out of my own hair it looks more like nothing. So, what I would like for my ideal hair salon: - A hairdressing salon without the radio that turns to donf: put a small calm music - people who speak slowly, and no intrusive questions (serious sometimes I had the impression of taking a interrogation) - listen to the requests of your Sivouplely customers, instead of always doing your sauce.- Time ranges on appointment only to reduce the wait- Retouching packages at low prices, like for roots or for fringes otherwise, I was never asked if I had washed my hair the same day, and in this case just wet it would be sufficient. Or if I have a sensitive scalp. Make my scalp do not come out of it all, what. And stop with your habit of putting lacquer all the time.	fr

Even today, when DNA is tested, there are times when blood is not associated with blood 5. There can be a very low probability (if you keep being shaken strongly, you will become a punching dranker) 6. There is a true story about the Abe Sada incident 7. As a lobotomy, I think it's rational because it doesn't make a hole in your head (though there are problems with lobotomy itself) 8.

Need a return of experience on vasectomy recently a male pill attempt revealed that the problem is partly in risk assessment. Médocs are tested in an individual * on `(risk avoided)-(risk caused)`. For a woman, the pill will induce certain health risks (including blood clot), but these risks are much lower at the same risks in the event of large. So `(risk avoided)> (risk caused)`, everything is fine. For a man, it's different. The pill causes (among other things) to a higher risk of blood clot ... but avoids none. The male pill does not avoid pregnancy to the one who takes it, so the sum `(risk avoided)-(risk caused) is negative, so it's not good and the drug must be refused. Obviously, the male pill takes a risk to a man to avoid his partner, therefore from the point of view of the couple the balance is positive. But it is not like that, if I understood correctly, that the calculation is done.	fr

"Are Women Paid Less Than Men for the Same Work?> What 3% measures is what is purely to an institutional bias once you remove the effects of all other factors. The argument is returnable right?

The vast majority of women avoid this sector during studies. Consequently, what relation with a patriarchal bias/promotion within a company if women do not have this qualification and that being a social worker, maternal assistant (98% of women), secretary (98% of women), it pays less than engineer in computer science? At my job it's terrifying, women are in HR, Comm, account and don't care about my job deemed ""technical and austere"" (like the account is not austere ...) and never in the big one they would have wanted to do the same studies as me ...

"Washington does not want labeling against junk food in Alena countries the problem will come to the same with indications per 100g. In fact, if you take your example of cereals, a quick calculation (mental) will give you a more precise result if you add 1 portion + 1/2 portion either 30g + 15g or 45g that if you do your calculation from 100g, or you will have to do a complicated calculation either by dividing by two, you are with less precise data than the previous ones. For oils, I made a quick verification, I have 5 different brands, 2 coming from the US, 3 of Canada (1 in spray). The Americans give all the nutritional information for 1 tablespoon or 15g, the Canadian women have all the same information 2 teaspoons, 10g. If you drink your canned campbell (who dares to eat it is so full of sugars, salt and other preservatives) you can easily know how much you consumed. The people who will worry about the color of the label are already those who return the boxes to read the labels, who take the time to do ""the calculations"" either by what they are concerned about their health either by what they have a health problem which obliges them to verify what they eat. The target of these labels are the people who are not interested in what they eat, they will not care on the contrary, as I said in another message, whether you put the proportions in 100g or tell them a color code or a letter, they may trust it but not in the sense that the authorities hear it. They will say to themselves ""Here is a product with code A, so it's good, I can eat it without restriction"" or then ""if the portion indicated is 100g it means that I can eat 100g without problem"". So in the end, the problem will be moved but not resolved. I do not believe that this will solve the problem of obesity and cardiovascular disease, education in the analysis of the labels would be much more effective but again the target populations will either not interested or unable to understand them. Note: If I am not mistaken, the quantities indicated on the packages correspond to the quantities to be consumed recommended by the nutritional guides."	fr

"WWF: Faced with ""climate shock"", biodiversity threatened with massive extinctions;If warming continues up to +4.5 ° C, half of the species of the regions richest in fauna and flora (Amazon, Australia & Grande Barrier de Corail, Mekong) will risk disappearing by 2080 except that if you have 10 species of different plankts and that you reduce to 5, the 5 remaining can very well be occupied (there is less competition). There is a big difference between having a species that disappear and all the species that fulfill a role in an ecosystem. For example in tropical forest you can find ultra specialized species that only live in a few places with some plants. If they disappear Bah from other plants which support warming will take the place and bring their ultra specialized species with it. After yes if a whole link in the chain disappears would be catastrophic but given the redundancies it is unlikely that we are witnessing a collapse. After all compared to the tropics, temperate climates are already a biodiversity desert (since long before man exists)"	fr

You are caught in the act of manipulation or fake news (speech from Bannon to the FN) indeed, although having a pro-Trump tendency (for economic and human protectionism), I remember being lit on The_Donald after having questioned their support for a law repealing the neutrality of the Internet. The_Donald is a curious mixture of propaganda, disconnect and freedom of expression (therefore not really free) that one does not find elsewhere even by transposing to other movements or political parties. I give you your opinion on the methods of politicians. It is mainly manipulations and simplifications by the mass media (and recovered by people) that pose me problem.

The administration we would like to be able to choose a person trained in the administration, who knows himself perfectly in the sector, and who has no interest in going in the direction of the bank. But it is not possible.** On the other hand **, in response to your sentence:> Is it me where there is a conflict of enormous interest there? I'm going to make the devil's advocate voluntarily but having worked at Goldman Sachs does not reveal a conflict of flagrant interest. Nothing says, a priori, that this person will abusive his position to go in favor of Goldman Sachs. There would be a certain conflict of interest if this person continued to work for Goldman Sachs in parallel with his mandate as Secretary of State. Now we are ** well agree **: the chances that it happens are far from zero. And there is a good chance for his past professional relationships to try to use his position to take advantage of it.

Classification of world fortunes: a Frenchman climbed in 4th place the concern is that if he dies, the State would take roughly 45% of what it has. Beyond the moral and ideological considerations, let's look at what concretely it would do: - it has 46% of LVMH, or 46% of a group of a market capitalization of 122 billion.- It would be 25 billion for the State in LVMH action (45% above 1 million euros). The concern is that the state is not intended to be the owner of LVMH, so it would sell the shares.- Large increase in the offer of LVMH shares -> Fall of actions.- Loss of the influence of a Arnault family in the LVMH group, with the arrival of new shareholders. Potentially a new decrease in shares. His death would be equal to the ruin of the company he built. He understands it then he goes to Belgium where the taxation of the transmission is much lower. Same when there was the ISF, he should have selling roughly 1% of his shares every year (being also taxed on the benefit of the sale), after 20 years it would like that the LVMH group would only have at 25% by him. You don't have the same control over a group with 25% as with 45%. This is the concern for these taxes on capital, it has an economic impact beyond the tax revenue of the State. He as a rational guy will never want to lose control of his box in 2 decades just to be a good citizen. So he steps.	fr

Following the manual, he wraps the tiger's head in a towel and slams it against the wall repeatedly to death. Although he is a child, he is a ferocious tiger.
