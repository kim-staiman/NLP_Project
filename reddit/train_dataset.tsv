"Washington doesn't want labeling of unhealthy food in the country of Alena. The information is already available. Fat is included and listed as lipids with trans and non-trans fats. Carb include fiber and sugar, which are actually called sugars. I regularly get products from Europe, and the nutrition information available on the packages are less detailed than on local packages. Besides the raw data in grams, you're given the daily percentage. For example: it's written 15 g of carbohydrates and they tell you that that's 10% of what you should eat as carbs per day, so you know that if you eat this product in the quantity written on the label, you know that you'll have consumed 10% of the carbs you need for the day. Otherwise, if you don't know how many grams of carbs of lipids you should eat per day, you can always refer to the percentage. The color or letter codes just tell you if the product is good for your health or not as long as you respect the quantity consumed written on the back of the package with the nutrition information. But a category A products can be as harmful as a category D if the person consuming it doesn't make sure to consume it in a reasonable quantity. The problem I see with this system is that people (those who care little about their health) will take an A product, but eat it without limits. ""Well, yeah, sure,"" because it's an A product, so it must be good for your health. They won't necessarily realize that if they eat the product without controlling the quantities they're swallowing, they might as well ruin their health with a category D product eaten in a reasonable quantity. The codes may give a false image of a product. In my opinion, it would be better to educate people on how to read labels rather than telling them that A is good and D isn't good."	fr

13 security vulnerabilities & backdoors in AMD's Ryzen / EPYC processors and their chipsets found by Israelis.

Your tips for a healthier life? Personally: Make donations and have a donations budget, even a small one (5 - 10eur per month). I tell myself that I help making the world turn in the right direction, and it's not costing me much Be vegan too. I'm not 100% vegan, I started with a single vegan meal per week, limiting meat consumption, helping me discover new recipes. Generally I always prepare very healthy dishes while enjoying the food itself Treat myself to a solo movie session, if I fancy watching a movie, I just walk in and do it Walk, take the time to discover new city neighbourhoods. At first, it might seem counter intuitive, simply walking without an objective, but just going where you feel like, I can't believe such a practice is being lost Write someone a letter. Again, thanks to technology everything has become so instant, it's truly a great feeling to take the time to write something down, wanting to hear back how the other person is. Gifting, even small ones, just like that, for no particular reason, simply for the person.	fr

Hmm, good right-mindedness, really greasy and really disgusting. IF YOU DON'T THINK LIKE US, YOU DON'T WANT EVERYONE TO LIVE BETTER. This message is beautiful, very intellectual, very honest. I've known kids in high school who have a more developed concept of politics than that. I admit that I voted for Macron to kill lazy salary payments and for the poor to die with their mouths open, also, I want the planet to die, and if possible, allow for tax deductions for people who are rich enough. Or then, just wait, it's going to get crazy. People observe the same problems but arrive at different solutions because of philosophical and political differences. Mind. Blown. But, no, continue to shout that the FN are racist assholes, Macron is all the elite assholes who hate the poor, and then that FI, well, they're the little cute nice guys who want to save the world.

When a people dies, it dies for a long time. I’m replying here to follow up to /u/KnownYogurt, and especially my own comment above. I’m going to start by bringing up certain points then will deal with the comment I’m replying to. Already, let’s praise your effort at a diversion. I would have appreciated for you to deal with the fact that you don’t know the history of Quebec (or at least, you don’t realize the impacts) because your concept of history is a large part of the problem and is your biggest obstacle to understanding the independentist position. It’s more of an issue of “we fought a long time ago.” We’ll get back to it. As for the illogicality, I’m sorry you see it like that, but it’s false. Feelings are not only illogical. First of all, my arguments weren’t only feelings. I could have produced a practically identical text to the one from /u/KnownYogurt (and I’ve written a few of them, but anyway, I imagine that forcing myself to say that I think like him will make me appear lazy, but anyway, too bad), these are independentist arguments that have existed since the beginning of the movement. But beyond that, the desire to be an independent nation, from the moment when you know that it’s *minimally* possible from a practical point of view, the desire is mostly emotional. The Yes voters in ’95 were tremendously motivated by a special affect for this dream they were sold, moreover, that the Canadian campaign was itself a movement of emotions (do I have to remind you of the love-in that took place at this time?). I’ll allow myself to be a sociologist here. This kind of motivation is what Max Weber called rational in value, or that we find rational methods to act in accordance with our values. Our emotions construct a certain logic of our action while being related to pragmatic reality. You do this every day, in every action where you act without being specifically motivated by a purely instrumental logic: you chose to pay more to eat something that you enjoy the taste of more that something else, you voted for some politician because you like their ideas more than those of another one, all while knowing *rationally* that I could tell you that it’s absurd to think they’ll do everything they say. You voted to stay in Canada  (we’re talking in theory here) because you built yourself a network of reasons that justifies the fact of staying, and you believe in your position as good because it’s *logical* while other see your arguments as illogical, restricted, and naïve. We’re all a bit “illogical” because we all have values that predominate our pure rationality, and we’re all a bit logical because we defend things we think are better for our condition. Reducing our actions only to an instrumental logic (which can be calculated as “more positive”) is completely misguided. I’ll give you a good example. For nearly 250 years (rounding up), our world has been mainly dominated by the absurd logic that capitalist development, or exploitation for profit through growth, is a factor of developing civilization. The proof is unshakable, through capitalism, our quality of life has improved exponentially! We have come to see growth as a factor of improvement of the common good, and since then, all large countries in the world have adopted the method: what is more logical is “think big Sti” and aiming for growth. When a federalist gets out of the economic arguments against separation, for example, refer to this logic: disrupting the economy is disrupting everything. So, we try to grow as much as possible because it’s logical. However, since the ‘60s, scientists have noticed that capitalist rely on a particular practice: the exploitation of our resources. They have also noted that our resources are limited in quantity. On the other hand, capitalist exploitation is so polluting that the biosphere is no longer able to reabsorb our pollution or consumption. Obviously, capitalism has proposed to reorient itself on sustainable development, a wonderful oxymoron, thinking that it’s possible to maintain exploitative growth while erasing costs, but the truth that more and more people seem to be accepting, is that it would illogical to think that capitalism can, in the long term, be sure to give us what it had been giving us over the past two centuries. We’re beginning to think that decreasing is the only logical way, an absolutely anti-profit way that could perhaps even be against our material welfare in the short term. So, my question to this long development is where is the true logic? What is rational? Has what used to be rational changed today? So, then what’s rational is not objective. We could very well understood illogicality 100 years earlier and avoid the potential disasters we’re risking today. Canada is still and forever aiming for growth (also having resorted to immigration to make up for low birth rates), but you can wonder why this growth is. It seems to me that the relativism this raises and the space this creates may (and has always) been filled by the “emotional illogicality” our rationality in values that dictates us what is good for us or not, which helps us to make societal choices because there is no objective and absolute response. It’s not a question of “because it tempts us,” but rather “because this is what we want.” *** > People I’ve met who have a desire to separate from Canada are often people who aren’t able to benefit from Canadian unity. These same people complain they’re being assimilated by the “English,” but they can’t see the irony of the situation when they decide to turn a deaf ear when the First Nations give them the same arguments. Beginning with the end, you’ll allow me to reply to your whataboutism with another one, which is, what is the relationship between Canada the First Nations? Seriously, this is a rather empty moral argument, and I sincerely think that a sovereign Quebec would be able to better solve its relationship with indigenous peoples. But here again, this is a very particular situation that deserves its own development. I don’t think that either you or I are able to debate this adequately for the moment. Reducing independentists to people who are complaining about being assimilated is an absurd yet common reduction. Allow me to simply ignore the strawman. However, the fact of benefiting from Canadian unity is a (hilarious) new one for me. You can develop this if you want. I’m curious. *** > Do you really believe that someone who lives in Vancouver has more in common with someone from Newfoundland than with someone from Quebec? No, certainly not. I even believe that Canada is an absurdity as a nation, and that many provinces would benefit culturally and politically from being independent. I think the real solution would be an economic union similar to the European Union. Obviously, the problem is still economic. Also, the “history” of Canada is mainly one of economic expansion, but I won’t go anything further with this due to a lack of space. > Yet at the same time, holding a grudge between our ancestors fought each other isn’t only counterproductive but also detrimental for everyone. Every time I hear this (very often), I tell myself that the new federalism taking up with the new generations is due to pathetic knowledge of our history. Our ancestors only fought each other twice: the Plains of Abraham and the Patriot Revolt. We weren’t at war: we were a colonized people. This was true until the Quiet Revolution (seriously, I’m not giving you a history lesson, but if you don’t understand the context of “speak white,” of Lake Meech, of the current constitutional context and everything that encompasses, I can’t do much for you.) > Quebecois and Ontarians, Albertans, etc. subscribe more or less to the same values. Emphasis on “more or less”! Look at all the electoral maps before 2015 for undebatable proof of this (there’s also an Imgur gallery with a selection of proofs of the different values between Quebec and the ROC, but I can’t find it anymore). > Every region of a country has its own demands, which cannot always agree with everyone. Well yes, this is a big truth. But beyond saying “that’s the way it is,” it doesn’t contradict “it should be different.” Your relativism isn’t clearing up anything. > If your point is that we could be economically independent, you could be convinced, but not because we could do it, we have to do it. If we want to do it, we should be able to have the right to. I don’t want to kick a police officer. I want to go and live in an apartment for my narcissistic parents to stop controlling my life. We don’t have the same values and their influence is harmful. They wanted me to build a pipeline in my bed the other day! Once again, I’m referring to my example above. Economic prosperity isn’t perhaps the goal to be sought. > […] Quebec is highly capable of working with other provinces of Canada. In a context of an economic union? Probably, but from a cultural and political point of view right now, we’re far from having the capacity for emancipation that you think the Canadian Federation is providing to us.	fr

"Cash Impact and pesticides: between errors and sensationalism. So the starting point is knowing if pesticides are a health problem (public or ""specific""), so: > You need to refer to the use of pesticides on farming land. No, you need to refer to the surface that needs pesticides (i.e., included in a technical itinerary where this makes sense), otherwise you dilute your numbers with surfaces that don’t have or have very little (temporary or permanent meadows or other pasture) and you don’t know the real dose injected. This results in the whole problem with comparing with countries that don’t have the same technical itineraries. The question is that on average, if a conventional farmer produces wheat, how much should he use of such-and-such pesticide? Eurostats doesn’t answer this question. It produces numbers whose purpose is to provide answers, but I’m the one wondering if these numbers are useless (the overall volume of pesticides is interesting for an economist who works on these markets). > Well no, we’re not that far off. Apart from the notion of the minimum extend, which I’m not citing, we’re more or less in the same ballpark (except the exact numbers of the size of these plants, etc.). I’ll cite it from memory, but it also seems that the FAO includes covering criteria, which is 10% (you spoke of 10% shading, you’ll have to look for the shade) and talks about surface. 10% is very little, hence my joke about the tundra (tundra is not supposed to have trees, and you can still often get to more than 10% coverage rate). Then, you were talking about ecosystems, and here again, I doubt that FAO wil take any risk on this because you’d be far from it in many cases (poplar groves, palm groves, etc.). Finally, you need to know what isn’t in the definition of FAO. They collect stated data from countries (and they begin to verify this data). Governments don’t always have an interest in providing the right number, and FAO also has its own interests."	fr

"In Calais, migrants refuse government meals. Systematic return to their countries would be the best solution. For one simple reason. Illegals pay thousands of euros to come. This money comes from the family or entire villages who send their ""son of the country."" At every step, illegal migrants go to a Western Union type office to get money for the next step. The logic is that this person will then start a money-pump. He'll get his family, his children to come and will make money. At the same time, he'll reduce the financial pressure on his village (fewer mouths to feed) and pay back his debt (with lots of interest), then send a few hundred euros to help out his loved-ones. Since 98% of illegals arrive in France to stay there long-term, it's only a question of time. The village will see its efforts rewards. If the illegal migrant is sent back home, the villages will see: 1) the physical proof of failure. 2) that the money invested has been lost. This would be the most efficient way to prevent deaths in the Mediterranean. But the No-Borders don't care about the God Complex."	fr

"Your opinions on men's perfumes? Already, r/fragrance exists. It's a sub that's a little bit biased because the Americans do not necessarily like the same things as us, but you will be able to have a lot of recommendations and ideas. He says he gets at least a new fragrance every day. In the lot it is necessary to differentiate two types of offers: - The designer perfumes. These are the classics Dior, Hermès, Chanel and also Zara, Devred, etc. Basically any perfumer of whom it is not the only job. They are rarely very original but smells good. Please note: big brands often have two lines, a mainstream that you can find in any Sephora, and another one, which is more exclusive that you will find in a luxury store or brand store. The price varies between 10 € to 250 € per bottle in general. - The ""niche"" perfumes. There we are in another universe with more strange and unique things, where the notion of gendered perfume tends to disappear. We oscillate between things that are better versions of existing things, or very original things. I regularly recommend Zoologist (Canadian perfumer), that creates fragrances inspired by living places and animal diets such as elephant, fruit bat or dragonfly. The prices of niche perfumes vary enormously, and the highest is... painful. I advise you to test the perfumes well before buying them. Nothing is worse than paying 100 € for a bottle and then telling yourself that you do not want to wear it. If you are in a big city, you will have a lot of possibilities in the shops, but otherwise sites sell what the Americans call ""decant"" (basically they share bottles in multiple sample size vials). It allows you to test rare or expensive stuff without losing a kidney. One point that I usually pay attention to is the performance of the perfume. 3 criteria are taken into account: - Longevity: does the perfume last? - Wake (fragrance trail): does the perfume leave a fragrance trail left by the wearer? - Projection: Does the perfume carry or is it ready for the body? Note that apart from the longevity that is critical, if you wear a perfume for you, the rest is less important. Sometimes niche perfumes sacrifice longevity to the olfactory art, I think among other things because some odorous molecules simply cannot last long on the skin (it is generally noted on citrus scents). Terre d'Hermès fulfills these 3 criteria. It has become a classic, rather worn by men over 30 years old, but in reality the perfume has no age (and not much of a sex). If you like the smell, go get it! Note that if, in theory, the concentration of aromatic molecules is different between Eau de Toilette, Eau de Parfum and Perfume Extract (at least to the most concentrated), this is not always the case and some perfume versions are less efficient or just very different from their toilet counterpart. The conditions also play on the performances: ambient temperature, ambient hygrometry, your body temperature and lipid levels on your skin. Terre d'Hermès fulfills these 3 criteria. It has become a classic, rather worn by men over 30 years old, but in reality the perfume has no age (and not much of a sex). If you like the smell, go get it! Some other tricks to test easy to find: - Bleu de Chanel - Habit Rouge - Guerlain (Eau de Toilette) - Kouros - Yves Saint-Laurent - Sauvage - Dior - Tom Ford - Black Orchid (Eau de Toilette, women's department) - Egoiste - Chanel - Zara - 9.0 In the brands niche easy to find and with a varied offer and some original references, you will have Acqua di Parma and Atelier Cologne."	fr

7 French people out of 10 favor the end of the status of train workers. I'm sure that you're one of those people who rise up for laws to be voted 40 to 10, even though there are nearly 600 deputies. This is naive. Most votes are decided ahead of time. If you know that the majority party in the parliament will vote massively for or against a law, there's no good coming out to vote. Worst case, the opposition will make the vote fail. The majority will re-propose it 3 days later, and this time, they'll come out en masse and the vote will pass. You're just stalling it for 3 days for nothing, and you make deputies come out for nothing much in the end. A deputy's job isn't only to sit in the parliament. They might be on a committee (where 95% of policies are decided nowadays), they may be on a diplomatic trip abroad, or be in their precinct, for example. There are tons of reasons why a deputy isn't at the assembly. Some of them abuse this, of course, but the vast majority of deputies, even when they're not at the assembly, are still working. Firing them just because they didn't show up in a place where they will for the most part be useless, is just stupid.	fr

One hypothesis is they indeed grew to serve as an argument and as a sexual stimulus when man started standing up, and that they no longer had access to the usual stimuli (buttocks). So then, they moved back into the curves they had in front of their face. 2 - Talking about it lets you use words and raise awareness with young women not to be careless with their breasts. With the number of cases of naked photos circulating on social networks in middles schools, where I work/have worked, I think that it's a good thing to make things clear. 3 - Prudishness about breasts that will be used to seduce the handsome Ethan is surprising. This is indeed the case, and talking about in clear terms seems wise to me. Otherwise, stop all this that helps to highlight your seductive assets. Ah yes, only when your an adult? And how do you know when you are one? And when do you learn this? And from whom? 4 - From memory, the extract mentioned doesn't praise large breasts, but instead, because he never says that ""the bigger the better,"" and he ends up instead with ""a small chest is very pretty as well"" or something like this, in short, an ode to difference. And to finish, I'll give my personal opinion: this controversy has reinforced my concern about people's ability to read, analyze and take a step back. Social networks promote the fast spread of simple, pre-digested information. We're becoming sheep with no real personal opinion or judgment ability. On this, we agree."	fr

You shouldn't act like the old women in their 40s and 50s who were raised back when Japan was flourishing who search for a rich husband. There are some ""3K"" (good academic background, high income, tall) bachelors out there, but there aren't many of them (the 3K bachelors actually out there either have bad personalities or are ugly). I think soon it will be commonplace for both husbands and wives to do both work and household chores and raising kids. If the situation regarding Japanese business isn't considered, the declining birth rate won't go away."	ja

7 French people out of 10 in favor of the end of the status of train worker. Great inequality, then. They have compensation because their salary is bad.

"An elementary school teacher said to a class of 4th graders, ""Do you all know about sexual intercourse?"" She then continued to talk about her own experiences and said things like ""Your teacher does it too"". If the teacher were in her 40s or 50s then I can picture a comic with a virgin repeatedly saying it's gross. To respond to it seriously, the number of parents/guardians is double the number of students, and if even one of them is a landmine then this will become a problem. School teaching has become something like a sport of avoiding landmines, so a teacher who talks about her own sexual experiences should be criticized. (She might be a good teacher, but if even a single parent sees that as a problem then it's no good.)"	ja

"Alexandre del Valle: ""The Islamic correctness is doing it for the terrorists""> ICM Poll (2016): 21% of British Muslims decline to condemn stoning adulterers (5% openly support them). Same thing: unrepresentative survey. Then, here is the question and the detail of the results: ""Tell me whether you sympathize or condemn people who take part in stoning those who commit adultery"". - 2% «\\ncompletely sympathise » - 3 % « sympathise to some extent » - 10 % « neither sympathise nor condemn » - 13 % « condemn to some extent » - 66 % « completely condemn ». - 6 % « don’t know » So, the figures that you are using don't really match the results then. >Pew Research (2016): A majority of Muslims in 10 countries favor basing laws on the Quran (inc. Pakistan, Pal. Auth, Malaysia, Jordan, Senegal, Nigeria, Indonesia, Lebanon and Turkey). Educated Muslims also favored Sharia, including 55% in 'secular Turkey'. The first sentence wasn't written by Pew Resarch. Here is the right quote: « Across 10 countries with significant Muslim populations surveyed by Pew Research Center in 2015, there is a striking difference in the extent to which people think the Quran should influence their nation’s laws. ». Same thing for the second sentence. Here is a real quote from Pew Resarch: ""Generally, more-educated people say laws should not follow Quran"". And the figure about Turkey is wrong: it's 45%. > Arab Observatory of Religions and Freedom (2016): 79% of Libyans believe Sharia should be the sole source of legislation, as 63% in Algeria and 60% in Morocco. So the question was not phrased in this way ... The question was not in relation to ""The Shariaa as the unique source of legislation"", but in relation to ""Shariaa as the unique source of inspiration for the law"". Secondly, the figures you quote are the sub-total Strongly agree and agree somewhat. However, the two answers are not necessarily equal ... If you just look at the strongly agree, it is 57% in Libya, 40% in Algeria, 40% in Egypt, 33% in Morocco, and 11% in Tunisia. > Africa Young - Arab Observatory of Religions and Freedom (2016\\n): Most Muslims in North Africa say they are Muslim first and citizens second. This is a principle source for migrants to Europe.\\nNo. The wording of the question is to feel rather Muslim than citizen of a country, not ""to be"". Then, this question was not spontaneous: we did not just ask the respondents ""what do you feel most about? By letting them answer freely, they\\nwere guided by several choices, which may have influenced their responses. And, impossible to know if they had the possibility to give several answers. Then there is a lot of variation between countries, and the differences between the percentage of those citing Muslims and those citing citizens are higher or lower depending on the country. Unfortunately, I do not have time to look at the few references that remain (I might do it later). Instead of bombarding with approximate numbers, often misunderstood, from sources more or less reliable and interesting, it might be better to focus on one or two studies, to enquire, and rely on solid figures that you really know and whose you can judge the impact... (And not just that you saw on the Daily Mail or Breitbart that are far from being references in reading statistics ...) One last point that I didn't really bring up: for all the cited studies , there are other figures that can qualify or even thwart the ""selected"" figures here or in the different articles. So, focus each time on one or two figures and ignore those who help less with the demonstration that we want to do, it is a rather questionable process and lacks rigor ...\\n"	fr

"If you think about it rationally, even if you find a girlfriend at work, if you break up or get dumped it will be uncomfortable, and there are various risks, right? I've never used it so I don't know, but I know an example of meeting via SNS. There are cases where things come together with somebody who Tweets like they are around the same age (Misty from Pokemon was my first crush, I watched Battle Athletes, etc.). So being of similar age you start to talk and get closer, and through popular things like Hatsune Miku or Vocaloid you get even closer, then while kidding around with online sex (like saying, ""Let's ***."" Wait, it's coming from them so it's not sexual harassment) it becomes earnest online sex, and you both start talking about meeting up, so you settle on a place to meet through direct messaging, then you start dating. Well, for my younger brother, by the way, he thought they were the same age but she was actually four years younger, so when they met he was a freshman at college and she was a 9th grader, kind of like that. She seemed to be into things that you'd expect of somebody the same age, so until they actually met he thought they were the same age. When she opened up it turned out she was a 9th grader, a cute, good girl. She did chores at home, and maybe the little sister was jealous or unable to stomach things, so she ended up making a mess of things and breaking them up."	ja

He wanted to create a more direct, ""simpler"" relationship between parents and teachers.

In my opinion, it's their experience that gives them the right to take a step back. Asking them to get off their pedestal, isn't it also denying their experience in some way.

Volkswagen promises one new electric vehicle per month from 2019. And how will this work on a large scale? Let’s say that 10% of its vehicle fleet is converted into electric vehicles. This makes 4 million vehicles. Let’s take an average of 10,000km per year with 30% of fast recharge, so 5-6 passages per year on the fast track (with 600km of autonomy). Immobilization time while plugged in of 1h each time (very optimistic since from what I saw for 200km of autonomy you need 30 minutes on a 125kW plug for a Tesla), so 6hx per year per car vehicle with 4 million vehicles it makes 24,000,000 hours, so roughly 3,000 plugs. Put like that it’s not so huge. I agree it’s feasible. However, you’ll need to convince the average person that it’s normal for the community to finance personal travel (which is currently the case with public plugs), and that it’s normal to wait 1 hour to refuel (personally having 2 people in front of me at the gas station pisses me off).	fr

The cards places on the table serve as a platform. *with limited usage: there's a certain number of curses to solve, but once it's done, the fun interest reduces since you already know the terrain. Of course, there's some randomness, but it's limited. In practice, players select a curse at the beginning, which gives the location of the the start and a clue. The starting *card* is a clue. There's a small portion of the *map* drawn on it. On the card, there may be challenges (strength, hunting, stealth, etc.) and there could be numbers on the borders. These numbers designat other *cards* that, put side-by-side, will form a larger *map*. The objective is to go across the territory to arrive in the place where you can lift a curse. You can compare it to, for example, books where you are the hero.	fr

Hugtto! PreCure is amazing. I don't know much about other Toei works, but in the case of PreCure, it feels like depending on the year and the episode things are scattered. From the start with season 1 through season 3 or 4 things would come to a close at the end of a season with 12 or 24 episodes in pretty standard fashion. But with each passing year the overall quality improves, and recently even aside from those wrapups the image quality is good and they are well produced, and as far as years go there are some years where they keep the quality high without missing a beat. I am filled with expectation hoping that this is one of those years.	ja

In a survey employing plagiarism checking software, it has come to light that over 20 of Shakespeare's works use lines and phrases copied from other work.

Here, we're not even talking about Monsanto (it's Syngenta who's concerned) and there's still one guy who replies. And it's so frustrating, it kills all conversation right away, then it's really easy as a reply. And above all, it's *really far* from the scientific reality of the problem. And even the political and ecological reality of the problem actually, the potential danger of humans, *we really don't care.* So yes, cancer and conspiracies sell better than the thinning of the arable layer (for example), yet it's still the most important thing.

"Unemployment insurance: Macron's flagship promise emptied of its substance It is on the brink of the fake title, the content is not so decided. Promise 1> Every five years, everyone will be entitled to it, if they choose to resign to change their activity or develop their own professional project. This will encourage companies to make an effort to improve the quality of life at work in order to keep their employees, which strengthens the bargaining power Arbitration: after 5 years of unemployment insurance, right to receive benefits after resignation ** if ** real and serious redevelopment / training project , approved by the regional joint commission. It is the social partners who imposed this condition, out of fear of abuse. But it does not empty the promise of its substance, which mentioned ""to change / develop"". Promise 2> We will allow all workers to qualify for unemployment insurance. Craftsmen, independent traders, entrepreneurs, the liberal professions, and farmers will have this protection like the employees.  Arbitrage: 800eu / month, only valid for judicial liquidations and those who had at least an annual profit around 10 000 euros. The risk of abuse was obvious, so it was absolutely certain that there would be a ""harsh"" condition and the obligation to be in liquidation makes sense. It proves that the adventure is finished and duly registered at the ICC. The profit condition, on the other hand, is a real problem. It is again to avoid abuse but it will get a lot of entrepreneurs out of the regime the ones who mess up in year 1 or 2, and may dissuade many people to even try their luck. I am an entrepreneur and I think it is still the right approach. In 3-4 years, an evaluation can completely decide to change the thresholds / income, based on the actual impact."	fr

Need to be checked by a pro? - Same for electricity. - How much are the property and council taxes? - In an area with historical landmarks and restrictions? - Rainwaters evacuation? -Ventilation? Does it work? - Concrete reinforcement on exterior walls / crack = no - If stairs: can a mattress/furniture/whatever you need fit with enough of a margin? - If stone house, is the exterior parging made of concrete? Humidity problems and not good for the walls - Distance job / bakery / school / supermarket (measured in real time, not estimated) Don't sign the sales agreement without having the mandatory diagnosis documents several days in advance.

With Deliveroo, the labor inspection attacks Uberization. – Article in the comments ## Deliveroo thinks it has the right as far they’re concerned. Officially, Deliveroo is not worried in the least. The company reminds us that the positions of the labor inspector are “against the Labor Law of 2016, which introduced into the Labor Code the notion of independent workers on digital platforms.” This is accurate, as explained here by Mediaprt. The Labor Law now distinguishes bike deliverers and other Uber drivers: since January 1, those who make at least 5,100 euros in annual income through platforms have the right to request them to reimburse the amounts they pay to insurance companies to insure themselves against workplace accidents. Deliveroo reports that it “goes even beyond this to assume our corporate liability,” by proposing since last September “civil liability insurance and additional health and providence insurance for free,” which cover all deliverers using its application. The future reform law on unemployment insurance should go further to distinguish workers on platforms from other independent workers because the government has planned to offer them within the next few days a specific condition to access unemployment benefits, different from the one that will be reserved for classic independent workers, whether they’re company managers, farmers, liberal workers or micro-entrepreneurs. “We are indeed moving toward creating a third status, and the labor inspection has understood this properly. It’s not just a simple law that will change the definition of what is and isn’t work,” objects Jérôme Pimot, a figure for bike workers fighting against platforms (whom we presented here, and invited here). Questioned “for more than seven hours” by labor inspectors, Pimot warns that he does intend to be a civil party in this case, which will have to trigger an investigation carried out by an inspecting judge. He intends to gather the greatest number possible of his former colleagues in the suit. “The challenge is uniting couriers who understood what Deliveroo is in terms of payment and working conditions, to get to the heart of the matter,” he says. These announcements do not trouble officially Deliveroo in the least, whose representatives say they are “confident about the legal outcome of this case.” It’s true that legally speaking, for now, the company has always been validated in its stance. The Paris supreme court has therefore, for the first time, confirmed in the Decree of November 9, 2017, the title of independent worker for a Deliveroo courier. Several other decisions, mostly in small-claims, have been similar. Jérôme Pimot himself was dismissed on February 1, along with two other couriers, for his requests to requalify into a classic work contract his contract with another platform, Tok Tok Tok. He will repeal. On September 26, nine other couriers who work for Take Eat Easy were dismissed. The judges rules that they were not competent to deal with relations between a company and self-employed workers, estimating that the workers should address the Tribunal of Commerce. This is the fourth time that the Paris small claims court have given a similar ruling. “It’s a battle that is far from being over,” says Parisian lawyer Kevin Mention, who is waiting for the small-claims ruling for 4 other Take Eat Easy couriers, and will be defending about a hundred others. “But the opinion of several law professionals is that this type of working relationship cannot be done under the status of an independent worker. A courier is not independent,” he insists. He gives the example of the situation that a Deliveroo courier presented to him: “He is questioned by the company because doesn’t have the right validate his orders until just before arriving to the restaurant he’s getting them from, as he usually does.” “They control him, they manage him, and there is clearly the notion of sanctions in the background,” the lawyer says. Furthermore, additional lawsuits are aiming at Deliveroo. The Regional Directorate of Equipment sent to the Paris public prosecutor’s department two tickets for “undocumented work” and “activity as a public road transporter of merchandise without being registered” specifically regarding the 252 Deliveroo couriers who work on their scooters. A last ticket for “abusive use of temporary contracts” to the company’s headquarters was also sent to the public prosecutor. ## The URSSAF calculates the loss of social withholdings. Eventually, the courts will have to choose between the judges’ current position and that of the administration, who have meticulously built up their cases over several months. One thing is now certain: by resorting to precarious and poor labor, by not being truly independent, rather than employees, digital platforms are exempt from the obligations that employers have on working time, health protection and safety for employees, workplace accidents, representation, payment for overtime, firing, etc. “The damages for workers” are listed in the ticket from the labor inspection: reduced health covering and pension rights, payment per task, blocked working times, precariousness, difficulty to find housing and loans, etc. A recent study from the Ministry of Labor about the “platform economy” confirms that if this new type of job offers “freer organization of working time.” And it risks also “degrading the quality of jobs by increasing precariousness and psycho-social risks.” Above all, by resorting to self-employed worker, Deliveroo pays much fewer social charges than if it employed salary deliverers: the company “eluded” 964,000 euros in social withholdings in 2015, and 5.46 million in 2016, according to a report issued by Urssaf to the labor inspection on December 7, 2017. Because besides the labor inspection, the URSSAF, which is in charge of gathering social withholdings due by companies for their salaries, also has its argument. It also has engaged a collections suit in at least one case. On December 7, 2016, its branch in Nantes notified Take Eat Easy of an overall claim of 718,000 euros, including nearly 493,000 euros for paying social withholdings, 28,000 in late penalties, and 197,000 euros in “additional collections for violating undocumented work.” The liquidator for the bankrupt company is contesting this collection in court. Have lawsuits also been applied by the URSSAF for Deliveroo? This would seem logical, but a spokesperson for the administration does not want “to comment on the situation of a specific company.” She still reminded us that the URSSAF is “always trying to have employee rights respected.” She estimates also that “we are indeed in the same type of situation as with Uber. This is the same kind of relationship between an employer and micro-entrepreneurs.” However, ruling that Uber was employing its drivers as classic salary employees, even though they are registered as independent workers, the URSSAF indeed attacked the American company, which is shadowing taxi work. Two distinct lawsuits are underway: the first one is penal, for undocumented work, and the second one is before the tribunal of social security affairs (TASS), to make Uber pay 5 million euros in unpaid withholdings over three years. A year ago, the TASS sided with Uber in First Instance, canceling the collection procedure, but only for reasons of form. The URSSAF is appealing the decision.	fr

"'Christianity as default is gone': the rise of a non-Christian Europe I'm exaggerating a bit. There are some, But apart from words of places or locations, I see others that do come from latin and then went back. For example ""Charrue"" comes from ""char"" and comes from transalpine Gaulish, but this word became curribus which means ""plough with two wheels"" in latin, and then became ""char"", (but not specifically ""charrue""). ""char"" is also ""carro"" in spanish and describes the same car. It's the same root. However, In Spanish they say ""arado"" (the thing that works the earth, from the latin arare) instead of ""charrue"". Pliny the  Younger already referred to chariot races as : ""curribus"", plural of ""currus"" (the chariot) in the year 50 AC. It's a Gaulish root which went through latin, latin that absorbed a bit of Gaulish before before spreading it everywhere it was spoken. In the same way, there are words that come from the Iberian Peninsula, and then integrated themselves into latin and that we use in French nowadays. Just like 'gordo' which is 'gurdus' in latin, which is 'grosse' (fat) in French, whereas before in latin they used to say ""magna"". Both etymologies were conserved to say different things. Basically, you get a mix and there are words leftover from before. But nowadays no one speaks Gaulish anymore, it's a language which disappeared completely 2000 years ago. We speak latin."	fr

"Can someone get me a figaro premium article? It's an ordinary winter evening. It is a little past 5:00 PM and on line 5 of the Paris metro, which goes north, the cars are crowded. A thirty-year-old, black cap sunk to the eyes, is glued behind a girl about twelve years old. Hooked, like her, to the center bar, he lets himself be rocked, pelvis forward, according to the braking and acceleration movements. A ""frotteur""? It is not easy for the police to surprise these men who take advantage of the high influx to sexually assault passengers. And yet, in the metro, there are ""predators"" ... According to two recent surveys, in Île-de-France, 43% of serious violence acts against women occur in transport, and in France, 87% of female travelers say they have ever been victims of sexual harassment. In order to ""free women's voices"", raise awareness among witnesses, generally passive, and punish the perpetrators, an information campaign and a single alert number for all Île-de-France public transport were both launched this Monday. Eighty police officers work in the brigade to fight against attacks on transportation security (Blast). Every day, in groups of two or three, in civilian clothes, they mingle with travelers and travel the lines in all directions. In search of the flagrant offense. ""The main problem, until recently, was pickpocketing,"" details the commander Nicolas Monrepos, chief of the Île-de-France network brigage security service. ""Recently, we've been seeing a lot of robberies with violence. As for the frotteurs, they represent 1% of the activity of the Blast: 31 arrests in 2017, a stable figure. ** Teen victims and retirees ** On the platform, we can already detect potential attackers: ""They position themselves behind, back to the wall, to better identify their victim,"" explains Maxime, one of the police. ""They can let two or three pass, to come back, come out, get in the next car ... then turn around and take the metro in the opposite direction. These men will stay standing, wherever the most people are, looking down. We spend the day observing people, their eyes, their hands, the waist circumference, to watch for inconsistent behavior. As soon as we find someone acting weird, we tail him (follow him, Ed). Before, these predators did not suspect that police could be onto them; today, they know."" Their profiles? ""All ages - 12 to 86 years old, all socio-professional backgrounds, all nationalities."" Suites, ties, like sweat pants, but ""often loose pockets, for touching themselves."" They are concentrated on the north of the RATP network, lines 2, 4 and 13. ""They cross the most criminal sectors of Paris and are used by a lot of tourists,"" comments Fabien, Maxime's teammate. Even if there were Europeans and also a Chinese, in the more than ten years that I've done this job, a very large majority of the perpetrators I've arrested are of Maghreb origin."" As for the victims, they are teenagers as often as retirees. And men too, more and more. Back on line 5, at the République station, where the supposed ""frotteur"" is still standing behind the girl. Fabien pulls the alarm signal. The suspect disembarks immediately, discreetly followed by Maxime. ""The gentleman behind you ... did you feel something?"" Fabien ass the pre-teen. But she did not notice anything; no need to disturb it further. Meanwhile, the man with the cap ""is already on another victim"", in another train, warns Maxime by SMS. Except that this young woman didn't notice anything either... ""One does not address the matter without the agreement of the victim,"" emphasize the policemen. Some do not want to complain: no time, shame, afraid to meet this man again someday ... So we try to convince them: next time, the author will perhaps take a girl ... While a complaint allows us to take his DNA, and he will be stuck. ** ""I settled my case alone"" ** The surveilance is finally abandoned: the suspect met a friend. But suddenly, in the crowded wagon, a man's voice rises. ""Oh, what's up with you,"" fumed a passenger. ""You done touching me?"" In the reflection of the glass, Fabien saw it all: a man in his sixties, his hand on the fly of a young man. ""Because of pride,"" he will not file a complaint either. ""What I don't want is him fiddling with me!"" he says. ""I settled my case alone."" As for the perpetrator, he plunges his nose under his scarf and disappears without asking for the rest. ""We must end this taboo! ""exclaims Commissioner Amandine Matricon-Charlot, head of the Regional Transport Security (RTS). ""Women think, wrongly, that there will be no consequences,"" she continues. ""For many, it's just an incivility. But it's sexual assault! The least violent, perhaps, but sometimes the most traumatic: frequently, when there has been ejaculation, the victim moves, changes their habits. As for the perpetrators, they often reoffend; it is therefore essential that they know that they risk 5 years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros. It is to the Gospel Street police station in the eighteenth arrondissement that the victims are led. They are hosted by specialized investigators of the sexual offense group (GICS), created in 2015. Last year, the GICS worked on 218 complaints of sexual assault throughout the Ile-de-France; 128 perpetrators were placed in police custody and 41 received prison sentences. ""This shows that it is not pointless to complain,"" insists the commissioner. ""And if there is no policeman in the area, you can always press the alarm button, in the wagons or on the platforms. The video surveillance images of the RATP are kept for 72 hours."" Alert numbers (3117 by phone, 31177 by SMS and the 3117 application) now make it possible to geotag the victim and trigger an intervention by agents, 24 hours a day."	fr

Washington doesn't want labeling against bad food in the NAFTA countries. Of course, and as your reward you get yourself downvoted. To answer your question: the economic principles on which the principles of free exchange are founded presuppose rational economic agents, that is, who know exactly what they are buying and have the ability to do the calculations to choose what is best for them. When you prevent people from making rational choices (either by hiding information or by making it too complicated), the market can't play its role, the race for the production of the best product at the lowest cost is transformed into a race for the conception of the best scam. Simple, informative labeling and ads that don't lie are the conditions necessary so that competition can play its role. If you take that away it becomes a race to the scam, and everyone loses (because instead of making efforts to produce useful things we all find ourselves making efforts to scam our neighbor or to avoid being scammed by him).	fr

Are convenience store onigiri getting smaller? Rice prices are soaring to stop depletion. If you think about it with common sense, stopping depletion→increases supply→price is reduced. I've heard that everyone wants to make branded rice, but the rice business is a field that seems to have a future, and I have a feeling that it might become polarized. It's strange that it's so extreme, but maybe it's specialization. It is said that there is a type of rice that's suited for beef bowls to be used in beef bowls, one that's suited for curry in curry, one suited for onigiri in onigiri, and it is said that there is a movement for rice production in cooperation with the restaurant industry. To simply say rice business=cheap rice is not the case, and I wonder if it will become more specialized by its usage. Well, the restaurant industry tends to buy up the rice but the amount ordered is stable so there may be an advantage in joining hands. In this aspect the situation is pretty different from milk, which has varied pricing. In the medium to long term the trend of reduction in household rice consumption must be tough.

Changing Martine's mind. It's basically a dispute between the pressed sovereignists, who believe that their cause is lost if a referendum isn't announced tomorrow morning, and the sovereignists with a more patient and strategic approach. The dispute predates Martine's arrival thanks to one of the only Bloc Québécois members who still support her: Mario Beaulieu, another pressed sovereignist. The thing is that in the last PQ run, the members and separatists went with J.F. Liseé's patient approach while Martine finished dead last (excluding PSPP), which should have drove home a clear message on the strategy that the members had chosen. However, sore loser Martine, who couldn't respect the PQ members' decision, decided to be pig-headed and push her pressed strategy on the Bloc while not caring at all about the PQ members' democratic decision to follow JFL's slow approach. So everything is playing out negatively in the PQ court and JFL's good deeds have been sabotaged since the beginning of the election year to make room for the good old sovereignist dispute in the media and hurt the whole movement.  At worst, she just has to call for a confidence vote among Bloc members and if she wins, she would have the right to stay and if she loses, we could turn the page and focus on the 2018 Quebec general election campaign.	fr

Games are not just for high level people. As always Ark uses last generation matchmaking and isn't being improved. Tekken hasn't been improved since the 7th generation arcade machine, and there's also that thing with character selection. Since 3 the household version has been continually getting worse. There are still rumors that the developers and top players are in collusion. Capcom does have the most stable matchmaking, but they are trying to reproduce the arcade timed releases for household use, and while I personally do think it's interesting and tried it, other than that it's been neglected and left to die.

On the origins of CRISPR. Absolutely. We're reaching levels now in the world of AI (or machine learning, or deep learning, let's not fight over the name). In the 5 best labs around the world that  deep seach on fundamental learning, you can find: -Deepmind, an English start-up that was bought and currently heavily financed by Google.  -FAIR, Facebook's research group on AI.  -OpenAI, a non-profit lab financed by about 100 million dollars a years from private fortunes in the US (including Elon Musk). --It's basically a ''charity'' gift but it's organised to be ble do research in a non-university lab that's also isn't commercial. In all these cases, you have teams that are organised in different ways but they're all proud that some have a fundamental research orientation whereas others are more about applied sciences. In France, in a university lab, 90% of the time it means ''admin system'' for ''real'' researchers, et the pay is terrible.  At the same time, almost no French think-tank would dream of paying researchers to do fundamental research. All of a sudden, the two fields are almost completely disconnected in most cases. It's not going to be easy to change this way of thinking, even though it's happening slowly (15 years ago, un doctorate was badly seen if you wanted to work in the private sector, right now the situation isn't ideal but at least it' fairly well regarded in certain areas). In sum I mostly agree, it's easy to make fun of university spergs who think commercialisation is a net loss for research, and some of that is true, but the thing is that on the other side, it's the labs that systematically refuse to do any kind of useful research and that even in some cases, complain they need to attract R&D funding.	fr

So, ending the status is a simple fiscal necessity, but it's a drop in the ocean for the budget. Just like the abatement of journalists is a drop in the ocean for the state budget. The other is that they are privileged workers, and there is no reason for that. Just like for the journalists, where is the justification for this benefit, as minimal as it is?

"Unemployment insurance: a flagship promise from Macron empty of substance. This smells a bit like the fake title. The content is pretty straightforward. Promise 1 > Every five years, everyone will have the right, if they choose to resign to change activities or develop their own career plans. This will incite companies to invest in improving the living conditions at work in order to keep their employees, for whom we'll also be strengthening their negotiation power. Arbitrage: after 5 years of adhering to unemployment insurance, they'll have the right to receive compensation after resigning **if** the project is real and serious for reconversion/training, approved by the regional equality commission. Social partners are who impose the condition for fear of abuse. But this doesn't take the substance out of the promise, which was talking about ""changing/developing."" Promise 2 > We won't allow all workers to have the right to unemployment insurance. Artisans, independent business owners, entrepreneurs, liberal professionals and farmers, like employees, will have this protection. Arbitrage: €800/month, only valide for receivership and those who had at least ""an annual profit or around 10,000 euros."" The risk of abuse was obvious, so it was absolutely certain that there would be a ""hard"" condition and the obligation of being in receivership is logical. This proves that the adventure has finished and duly registered at the Chamber of Commerce. The condition of profit, however, is a real problem. Again, to prevent abuse, but this will take out of the scheme a good number of entrepreneurs who screw up in year 1 or 2, and may dissuade many people from even trying their luck. I'm an entrepreneur and I think it's still the right approach. In 3-4 years, an evaluation may completely decide to change the threshold/income based on real impact."	fr

Criteria for the purchase of a house. My advice is a bit different from your question but here it is anyway: take your time! You have the right to go see, see again, see something else, re-re-see, see with a friend you know, an artisan who will give you an estimate for any work... you will take on several decades of debt so take your time. The other advice is to put in writing all the appliances (equipped kitchen or whatever) which are part of the sale. That's 90% of the trouble afterwards. I won an oven for 2000 bucks. I really liked this conversation with the seller:  - But in the end I'll take my oven. - No, madam, you sold it to me with the apartment unless you want to cancel the sale agreement. _ But finally, if you don't give it to me, I won't have an oven. - Well, yes.

Map of the latest electoral projections. I come form Marie-Vic, and from the 450. My family all comes from there, everywhere in Montérégie. I think it makes sense that Montérégie is now getting rid of CAQ. I can understand the mentality of people who are getting rid of CAQ from the region. But Marie-Vic is a mean, mean big PQ stronghold and also has a star candidate that is extremely loved by the people locally. PQ electors in the country are *so* already acquired, it's pretty crazy. They're PQ to death. If I rely only on my feelings, I think the numbers are wrong for Marie-Vic. I have a really hard time believing that the PQ is in any danger in M-V. But in places like Vachon, Montarville and Chambly, it's logical I think. M-V is a real political bubble on the south shore.	fr

"7 French people out of  are for the end of the status of train workers. Today, I found out that the SNCF is disconnected form the French and world economy. > What bothers people with the special status train workers hold is not that they have better conditions than average. Yet, this same gripe continues and with no justification. Make a list of the advantages and disadvantages of train workers. Once you've done this, you'll observe that the balance is far from being as advantageous as you might think. > They have these conditions at the expense of the rest of the population. No problem: starting tomorrow, you'll be paying your train tickets at their actual cost, and in exchange, you won't have to pay your share of the tax that funds these subsidies. Spoiler: you're going to lose a lot of money. > If any company wants to give jobs for life or pay for early retirement, no one would be bothered. The problem is that when this company demands 13 billion in subsidies per yer to be able to give this out, otherwise they'll freeze everything (the country). It's like hospitals: they're paid partially by the state because it's a public service. Look at hospitals today: they're chock full, their working conditions are horrible, and nothing is changing because they're not allowed to strike (under penalty of people dying). The result is that the system is crumbling due to a lack of means (voluntarily). This can justify privatization and so you'll have to pay much more for care (hello, USA). This will be the same thing for the SNCF: the only thing attracting people to them is the status. Once you take it away, you won't have enough staff or it will be under-qualified. This will screw up and boom, you've got privatization. The result is that you'll be paying more (hello, Great Britain). > Here, precisely, those who are seen as selfish ""fuck you got mine"" are train workers, not the rest of the population. You have a large majority convinced that they're working beasts that that others are lazy. We've been hearing the same lies to them about train workers for years. There's nothing objective about them. Bonus edit: ask any French person, and they'll be against reforming their job to remove social protection. Like I said in my first comment, today it's the train worker, tomorrow it'll be the dockers (who are breaking cancer records), after than, another public service, etc. In the end, you'll have only private companies that will cost an arm and a leg for barely any better quality service (or even worse service)."	fr

Unemployed people: the government unveils a new arsenal of sanctions - L'Express ranting. Are we living badly in France? A couple of modest people, having done little study, having average jobs lives quite ok (holidays, trips, cars...). Frankly, it blows me up to read things or we would believe in modern slavery while just going outside to realize that we are still a very rich country. Just go to a coconut country or a former coconut country to realize that the standard of living is significantly lower. So capitalism certainly has flaws but I do not see the crushing of people in France... Ok, there are poor people, but there are also a lot of people who go soft on the money that others have earned. It's not going too far in your opinion, no? We are in a country with lots of holidays, very good wages (especially for average jobs), very cheap hospitals, free studies, well paid unemployment for a long time, all sorts of help for those who have no job, very low direct taxes for most people and you come to present this as fucking misery, move your ass and go work a little.

"Criteria for buying a house. My advice doesn't exactly answer questions, but here it is anyway: take your time! You have the right to go and see, see again, look at something else, see again and again, see with a friend who knows about the matter, a worker who will give you an estimate for possible construction work, etc. You're going to have it for several decades of debt, so take your time. The other advice is to really put down in writing all the appliances (equipped kitchen or whatever) that are part of the sale. It's 90% problems later. I won an oven worth 2,000 bucks. I really like this conversation with the seller: ""So in the end, I'm going to take my oven."" ""No, ma'am, you sold it to me with the apartment, unless you want to cancel the sale compromise."" ""But, if you don't give it to me, I won't have an oven."" ""Well, yes. And if I give it to you, I won't have an oven. Logical, isn't it?"""	fr

The guy from Nice was just an ordinary Muslim, and so were the Kouachi brothers, etc. There's no real link between Salafism and Jihadism, and if it's so porous, and it gives them a framework, it's not automatic, either. Beleive me, if we knew, we would have done something about it a long time ago. Their only point in common is that they use Islamic scripture to justify their desire to kill people."	fr

Criteria for purchasing a house. In no particular order, my personal cheklist poise: -Flood-prone area? -Good internet access? (ask the former tenant or check with a neighbor) -Talk for 5 minutes with each neighbor available (don't hesitate to come back another day without having the seller with you) -Roof last replaced when? Needs verification by a pro? -Same for electyricity. -Amount of property and living tax? -In a historical monument area with restrictions? -Rainwater drainage? -Every door and window in good working order? -Ventilation? Working? -Concrete reinforcement column on the outer walls/cracks = Nope. -If there are stairs: will a mattress/piece of furniture/whatever fit with enough room? -If stone house, concrete spackle outside? Moisture problems and not good for walls. -Distance to work/bakery/school/supermarket (measured as real time, not estimated). Don't sign any compromise without having several days with the docs with the required diagnostics. You need to read them with a clear head. They're sometimes full of useful information. During the visit: -with each eluded or answered in an unsatisfactory manner, note it down and ask it later: don't let a single thing slide. -Don't believe what the seller is saying (take it as an indication). -Laser telemeter for all measurements. -All estimates for construction work are largely underestimated by the seller. No estimate = you don't know.	fr

Criminal responsibility lies directly with the person who committed the crime. The rapist should be judged for rape just as a murderer is judged for murder.

The important thing is that the the alignment between the philosophy of the current administration and the views of the popular comedians of the day is not always pandering or aligning to the establishment view, but is what they really think, and the mainstream view among we modern Japanese people.

There are two essential principles in the status of train worker: one is that they cost too much and the SNCF is in debt. So, the end of the status is a simple accounting necessity. However, it's a drop in the budget. Just like subsidizing journalists is a drop in the state's budget. The other is that they're privileges, and there's no reason for this. Just like journalists, where is the justification for this benefit, no matter how small it is? Since you seem to be in favor of the end of the train worker status, you should logically be in favor of removing this subsidy as well."	fr

No matter how hard many men work they can't even get their hands on sex robots, nobody would work hard in a hell like that. About 80% of the reason men work hard is to get sex, so there's no way that taking that away is a change for the better. Growth in the West is built on immigration and the exploitation of Asia, but those are almost at their limit. With Asian independence and a lack of sex being supplied to the losing males in the West, it will all end for real. The value of women will crash and women will work to support some men, but there's no way that can last so in the end it will mean ruin.	ja

"You were caught red-handed manipulating and spreading fake news (Bannon's speech at the FN). I'm pretty much with you on that since the arguments that Bannon  presented aren't fake news.  >Sovereignty. For the last time, Europe doesn't affect the sovereignty of the U.S. in any way. It has to be looked at as a mandate. If I give my brother a mandate to vote on my behalf and he does so, has he taken my rights? Of course not because he could only exercise this right of mine by virtue of my express authorization to do so, and it's the same with Europe.  >Freedom  Catch-all word that doesn't mean much anymore and I know what it means. Surely the freedom to bear arms, perhaps? Freedom of speech? Apart from the fact that every country, indeed including the United States, has limits on freedom of speech, which has never been absolute.  >You're debating about your country and they call you racist. Oh pardon me, but the thin veil of ""but I just mean the Muslims"" does exist. It's a nice little ""loophole"" if we don't look beyond. 1) Yes, I hate all Muslims because it's a ""hateful religion"" 2) I think no whites, but rather only Arabs and blacks can not only be Muslim but always will be. (There's just the problem with the Sikhs and other religions who get caught up in the shit because they're thought to be ""Muslim""). So the mixing of races and religions, under the pretext of using religion to criticize a race, is... *drum roll* racist.   -----------  After all, it only concerns people like Bannon and co. who don't know how to debate without abominable rhetoric. There are good people who vote for the far right, not necessarily by ignorance. These people are just hidden by the genuinely racist and xenophobic masses because if France is so racist and xenophobic, who would we vote for? Mélenchon? Macron? It would either be like under Juppé (whose sight the youth can't stand) or Le Pen, and...there you have it.  Edit: →Sikh."	fr

Nor are we really in a situation where coaches are threatening to kill the TGV. But still, the TGV is still very expensive to operation. More than a coat per passenger, in any case. So, even in absolute terms, it would indeed not be stupid to create a third class in the TGV with seats closer to each other that in second class, the costs would remain higher (understanding that as long as the ticket isn't subsidized to nothing) than those of a coach, and I'd be willing to bet that the discount option wouldn't be appreciated that much by customers (you have to admit that ""3rd class"" isn't really considered good nowadays), who will prefer to take a cheaper coach, even if its surely slower and slightly less comfortable."	fr

"Can someone get me a figaro premium article? AN ORDINARY WINTER'S EVENING. It's a bit past 5 o'clock and on line 5 of the Parisian subway, heading north, the cars are chock full. A thirty-something man with black cap pulled down to his eyes is squished behind a girl of about twelve. Like her, he's holding onto the central bar, letting himself sway with hip hips thrust forward as the car brakes and accelerates. Is this a ""frotteur""? It isn't very easy for cops to surprise these men, who take advantage of the high density to sexually assault passengers. And yet, in the subway, there are lots of ""predators."" According to two recent investigations, in Île-de-France, 43% of serious violent attacks against women take place in transportation, and in France, 87% of female travelers state having been victims of sexual harassment. In order to ""liberate the voice of women,"" raise awareness with witnesses, who generally do nothing, and punish the perpetrators, an informational campaign and a single alert number for all public transportation in Île-de-France have been launched since Monday. Eighty officers work in the Anti-Safety Infringement Brigade in Public Transportation (Blast). Every day, in groups of two or three, under cover, they blend in with travelers and travel the lines in every direction. Looking to catch them red-handed. ""The main problem is that until very recently, it was pickpocketing,"" says commander Nicolas Monrepos, the head of the safety department of the brigade on the Francilian network. ""Now, we're seeing lots of violent theft. As for frotteurs, they represent 1% of Blast's activity: 31 arraignments in 2017, which is a stable figure."" **Teenage and retired victimes** On the platform, you can already detect potential aggressors: ""They set themselves back with their backs against the wall in order to better spot their victim,"" says Maxime, one of the officers. ""They may let two or three trains pass by to suddenly get in then leave, then get back into the next car. Then turn around and take the subway in the opposite direction. These men will stay standing wherever the most people are, looking downward. We spend the day observing people, their eyes, their hands, their belts, trying to find unusual behavior. As soon as we find something unusual, we'll track them. Before, these predators never suspected that officers could be watching them, but today, they know."" Their profil? ""All ages, from 12 to 86 years old, from all socioprofessional backgrounds and all nationalities."" Suits and ties or tracksuits, but ""often with unsewn pockets so they can rub themselves."" They’re concentrated in the north of the RATP network, on lines 2, 4, and 13. “They cross the most crime-ridden areas of Paris and are taken by lots of tourists,” says Fabien, a teammate of Maxime’s. “Although there are Europeans and also a Chinese guy, in the more than ten years I’ve been doing this job, the perpetrators I nab are very, very mostly of Maghreb origin.” As the victims, they can be teens or the elderly. And men as well, increasingly. Back on line 5, at the République station, where the alleged “frotteur” is standing behind he girl. Fabien sounds the alarm. The suspect gets out immediately, discreetly followed by Maxime. “The guy standing behind you – did you feel anything?” asks Fabien to the preteen. But she didn’t notice anything, so there’s no use bothering her any further. In the meantime, the man with cap “has already found another victim,” in another train, warns Maxim by text message. Except this young woman didn’t feel anything, either. “We don’t pursue anyone without the victim’s consent,” say the officers. “Some of them don’t want to press charges because they don’t have the time, are ashamed, may run in the man again one day. So, we try to persuade them. The next time, the perpetrator may attack a little girl. But pressing charges will let us get his DNA and he’ll be on file.” **”I solved my case by myself.”** The pursuit is eventually dropped: the suspect met up with a friend. But suddenly, in the packed car, a man’s voice is raised. “Hey, what’s wrong with you?” shouts a male passenger. “Have you finished touching me now?” In the reflection of the window, Fabien saw everything: a sixty-year-old with his hand on a young man’s zipper. “Out of pride,” he didn’t want to press charges, either. “What I don’t want is for him to fondle me!” he shouts. “I solved my case by myself.” As for the perpetrator, he buried his nose in his scarf and disappeared without asking for anything. “We’ve got to end this taboo!” exclaims commissioner Amandine Matricon-Charlot, who’s at the head of the Regional Transport Safety (SRT) commission. “Women wrongly think that it won’t happen again,” she continues. “For many, it’s just bad manners. But it’s actually sexual assault! Perhaps the least violent kind, but sometimes it can be the most traumatizing: frequently, when there’s been an ejaculation, the victim will move houses or even change their habits. As for the perpetrators, they often strike again, so it’s crucial that they know that they risk 5 years of prison and 75,000 euros in fines.” At the police station on Rue de l’Evangile, in the 18th arrondissement, the victims are taken. They are welcomes by specialized investigators in the Sexual Crimes group (GICS) created in 2015. Last year, the GICS worked on 218 complaints of sexual assault in all of Île-de-France, 128 perpetrators were detained, and 41 were charged with prison sentences. “This shows that it’s not useless to press charges!” insists the commissioner. “And if there are no officers in sight, you can also press the alarm button, in the cars of on the platform. The videosurveillance pictures from RATP are kept for 72 hours.” Alert numbers (3117 by phone, 31177 by text, and the application 3117) now let you geolocate the victim and trigger an intervention by agents, 24 hours a day."	fr

How Adam Smith's work has been distorted to serve savage capitalism. Damn! No! There are exactly 0 economists (including the marxists) who believe that free competition that is not distorted is bad. Because rightly it can't not be distorted unless it takes externalities into account. (By the way, no economist thinks a monopoly is a good idea, and that if a monopoly has to exist, it should be in public hands). And you will find almost no economist who will tell you that globalization is bad because if you are one and you think the happiness of a Chinese or of a Vietnamese person counts less than that of a Frenchman or a Norwegian, you really haven't understood anything. You will find lots of economists on the other hand who think that it's an important role for the state to redistribute the gains from globalization.

A French village name generator? You can make a simple, effective version without deep learning by concentrating on names with two or three words. For example. You don't keep anything except villages with three words: Esnières-sur-Gironde   Couilly-les-bains   Breuil-le-soc    You cut each name in three:   ['Esnières','sur','Gironde']     ['Couilly','les','bains']   ['Breuil','le','soc']    And to randomly choose one piece of each:   Esnières les Soc    You can even mix the first and the third part:  Breuil Les Esnières  You add a bit of an algorithm to manage plurals, some inconsistencies, etc.  In Python it goes quickly.

'Christianity as default is gone': the rise of a non-Christian Europe  That’s what I understood and no, it’s not the same. Let’s say (for simplicity, it’s not the real numbers, understand) that the native (non-immigrant) population has a stable rate : 100 people of generation 1, who give birth to 100 people of generation 2. Let’s say that the immigrant population is twice as fertile : 100 people of generation 1 give birth to 200 people of generation 2. Let’s also say that every generation you add 100 people who are immigrants and who also have 2 children per person (i.e. 4 per woman). Let’s count young immigrant people generation per generation:  ------------------------------- Scenario 1: the descendants of immigrants, in 1 generation, adopt the native habits and begin to have 1 child per person (=2 per woman).  1. We start with 100 gen1  2. Immigration: 100 new gen1 arrive. Reproduction: 200 gen2. Total 100+200=300 3. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 200 gen3 + 200 gen2. Total 100+200+200 = 500 4. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 200 gen4 + 200 gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+200+200+200 = 700 5. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 200 gen5 + 200 gen4 + 200 gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+200+200+200 = 900  There are 200 more people per generation.  --------------------- Scenario 2: the descendants of immigrants keep the same growth rate.  1. We start with 100 gen1  2. Immigration: 100 new gen1 arrive. Reproduction: 200 gen2. Total 100+200=300 3. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 400 gen3 + 200 gen2. Total 100+200+400 = 700 4. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 800 gen4 + 400 gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+800+400+200 = 1500 5. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 1600 gen5 + 800 gen4 + 400 gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+1600+800+400+200 = 3100  Growth is exponential and doubles every generation.  -----------------  In both cases the population grows, but at very, very different rates. The question is whether deconversions progress at the same pace.	fr

US army responsible for frequent accidents. Marine Corps says 37% of helicopters are ready for flight. No, the response was that of the weapons installed, it's standard for only 30% to be active. But 90% of fighters are online, and that's apparently the strength behind the US army and JSDF. That's what it said, at least. That's why in the first response it said that it wasn't helicopters. You should treat these as two separate issues. According to the original article, a liutenant general with the Marine Corps reported that the rate of online helicopters for the Marines is not more than 37%. So if you look at that reference, even though it's unclear to what extent that has decreased, you can clearly tell that for the Marines, it's now at a level too low to ignore. Simply put, it may be nothing more than a plea for an expanded budget.	ja

Deportations **avoid** the majority of crime in Danemark and in Norway, it should be nuanced. > It is simply ridiculous to pretend that they replaced jail sentences with deportation in their model to fight against crime. No. Here is factual evidence. If we used deportation to the same level in France, we would instantly have at least 20% fewer criminals, and given recidivism rates, about 50% fewer in the long run. The majority of crime is committed by very few people who can't be integrated or reintegrated. >Which are wrong and come from propaganda sources aimed at destabilizing the European Union. Which are true and come from official data sources or Swedish press articles. > Typically 18 to 20 thousand of yearly gross income, so not very far from what I estimated. Typically the amount of minimum wage. As I said from the beginning. > The problem caused by a lack of available jobs remains partly related to automation, and the unwillingness from the parties on the right to fight against the scarcity of full employment with social benefits. The problem is by one third caused by international competition (labor costs), by some lack of innovations in France (obsolescence) and for the last third by automation, but anyway, criminals will not be okay working for being paid minimum wage. Left extremists countries are even more in trouble compared to others, because you can't simply give social benefits and still have a production that makes enough value to make sure wealth redistribution will last forever. The solution you are proposing, with social benefits for everybody, cannot work in the case of a massive influx of immigration. >> You just need to eradicate poverty! Nobody ever thought about that! >> The point is that we have the possibility to do it at a government level. No. Nor can we eradicate crime. We already have a totally bankrupt system, which is incapable of supporting itself, which needs to always borrow more and more in order to make up its deficit and whose imbalance gets worse and worse. Moreover, if you use billions to fight against poverty you'll repel capital financement and send investors off to other places, and by doing so you endanger future generations. > And we had almost eradicated poverty in France during the sixties. After long years of budgetary discipline under De Gaulle, without minimum income allowance, without family immigration, without population imbalances, with China just being so small back then and Africa five time less populated. Everything has changed. > ""Relative Poverty"" (regarding your neighbors or the country) will always exist, but we can eradicate situations with housing, food and basic needs in the country. Not when you welcome 250,000 people every year. > However, common corruption among governments from the right parties and the billions sent to bosses, as well as the neoliberalist ideologies (saying that taxes should be abolished, that minimum wage questioned, that everyone needs to work themselves to the bone for every single euro earned and that retirement and paid vacation have to cease), are by essence not compatible with this objective. Every time you learn that 10 euros have been deducted from your housing allowance and that your heating bill is 200 euros more expensive every year because the National Gas Provider Company became a private company, this is the right problem. Housing allowances did not exist in the sixties and heating bills accounted for about 7% of household incomes like they do today (source: *Energy consumption: equivalent expenditures between fuel and domestic energy*). The billions are collected from small companies, way more than in the sixties, when the tax burden was lighter for craftsmen and SMEs. Large companies are fully benefiting  from it, but this is one of the consequences of globalization and the EU.

'Christianity as default is gone': the rise of a non-Christian Europe  It is what I have understood and no it is not same. Let's put ( to simply, it is not the real numbers ) that the indigenous population (non immigrant) has a stable rate : 100 people of the generation 1 give birth to the 100 people of the generation 2. Let's put the immigrant population twice more fertile : 100 people from gen1 give 200 people from gen2. Let's put also that each generation add 100 people frankly immigrated who do two children per personne ( means 4 per wife) Let's count how many young immigrant there is generation per generation .......................Scenario 1 : the descendant of the immigrant adopted in a generation the indigenous  et start to produce  children per person (=2 per wife). Let's start with 100 gen 1 . 2 migration : 100 new gen1 arrived. REproduction : 200 gen2 Total 100 + 200 = 300 3. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 200 Gen3 + 200 Gen2. Total 100 + 200 + 200 = 500 4. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 200 Gen4 + 200 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100 + 200 + 200 + 200 = 700 5. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 200 Gen5 + 200 Gen4 + 200 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100 + 200 + 200 + 200 = 900 There are 200 more people per generation.  ---------------------Scenario 2: Descendants of immigrants adopt the same growth rate.  1. We start with 100 Gen1 2. Immigration: 100 new Gen1 arrive. Reproduction: 200 Gen2. Total 100 + 200 = 300 3. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 400 Gen3 + 200 Gen2. Total 100 + 200 + 400 = 700 4. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 800 Gen4 + 400 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100 + 800 + 400 + 200 = 1500 5. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 1600 Gen5 + 800 Gen4 + 400 Gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100 + 1600 + 800 + 400 + 200 = 3100 growth is exponential and double for each generation.  -----------------in both cases the population believes, but at very, very different rates. The question is whether the deconversions are progressing at the same rate.	fr

"Urban planning: to whom are the keys of the city given? ** Three to four slopes ** So today, who makes the city? As Emmanuel Macron, then Minister of the Economy, said at Mipim 2016, ""public money is scarce but cash is abundant"", even if it is those who have the cash that have become masters of the game? ""The public authorities are perhaps a little weakened financially,"" admits Etienne Marcot, ""but not at all on the legal level. Politicians have never had so many instruments of law to make their urban vision prevail. What happens afterwards is their responsibility."" The elected representatives therefore have a power. Admittedly, it can first be used to prohibit: no buildings too high, no building without parking ... Or to compel: all white shutters, all roofs with four slopes ... The rules are not lacking, far from it and, proof that domain inflation does not guarantee anything, ""no regulations have ever prevented the construction of a failed building,"" the architect Yves Lion told us one day. Conversely, wanting to make money in real estate does not necessarily mean that you have nothing in your brain. Investors and developers have expanded their business to the point of being able to provide all elements of the urban, including public space. Should we then give them the keys to the city? It is in any case the reproach that was made in the contest Re-invent Paris. In this consultation launched in 2015, the City of Paris offered 23 places for sale. Investors and promoters were invited to compete to win the development of sites of interest. But be careful, no question of coming with his checkbook. The city asked for a project for each venue, supported by a team of architects and town planners, of course, but also landscape architects, experts in sustainable development, urban agriculture and, very often, artists. Who is the leader in this group? The person with the money or the person with the ideas? Philippe Chiambaretta, who participated in the competition with investors Hines and Eurosic, said that the receiver and financier were rather at the same level, one needing the other and vice versa. ""The classic pattern in which the mayor says to himself: 'I make plans, I divide my land into lots that I put on sale to the best with an architectural competition behind them,' it's not terrible. With Re-invent Paris, Paris will not sell the land to the one who pays the most but to the one who will reflect the most."" In fact, the first edition has resulted in an abundance of urban creativity such as we haven't seen in a long time. However it also caused as many criticisms. The remuneration of the architects was at the goodwill of the investor and many of the prime contractors did their work for free. The corporation did not fail to complain about it. Moreover, even if Re-invent Paris was an outstanding commercial showcase for promoters, they estimate for their part that the participation in the festival cost them millions. They took on the cost of this mega-contest that the City of Paris could not afford. Since then, the rules of the game for this type of consultation - regarding the metropolis or the Seine - have been clarified a little. But still, is it normal that the public power asks the private to have ideas in its place? Would the authorities legitimized by democracy have renounced manufacturing the city? Olivier Malapert, architect, believes that what Re-invent Paris shows is that elected officials ""do not have the infused science. When the public power recognizes that it has weakness, that's good. It is far from the time when Jacques Chirac trumpeted: ""The architect of Les Halles, it's me! Philippe Chiambaretta wants to recognize ""the act of humility of a city that says it does not know, for example, what will be the mobility of the future. But when a mayor says that what he wants to keep is a social mix, he is in politics."""	fr

"An ""abandoned"" Eurostar in Valenciennes? Plus the cost of maintenance of wagons that is huge. The cancellation of some Eurostars (so-called NOLs planned to circulate north of London, the last trains built from TMST, delivered in 1996) is due to the fact that: - The most recent trainsets in a series are often the first to be scrapped (as it is usually the last ones that are renovated and end up being the most obsolete when deciding to stop renovations), which makes that it still circulates the first TGV trains which date from 1978 but not the last ones that came out in 1985. - The Eurostars have special features, they are very long (14 wagons) and cannot be coupled in multiple units, in addition to being cut in the middle (which is useless outside the Channel Tunnel) and their floor is high (91 cm because it is the height of the platforms in England, while in France it is maximum 58 cm*). Even worse (with 14 wagons they could do Bordeaux-Marseille services for example), they cannot circulate under 1500 volts in France, so it prevents them accessing the South of France. - All this contributed to scrap them off, and the arrival of Siemens Velaro to replace them did not help. As explained in the beginning, these trains were originally used to ensure trains in north London, but since other train sets were chosen for these trains, they were a waste. And nobody is going to put their neck out to buy of 20 year-old trains that are very complex and expensive to maintain. In the same category I name Japan, famous for its disposable TGV, the oldest in service since 1997. \\* *Except RER network which has high platforms for certain lines*."	fr

Choose a bike to go to work. Welcome to the club. Here's my advice from 15 years of practice: *No sports bikes with thin tires: too fragile and uncomfortable. *Ideally in the beginning, get a used bike. *Get tires with kevlar reinforcement. *Get sturdy material: new bikes for €99 are rubbish. *Don't forget lighting: a hub dynamo may see like a luxury, but you'll never have problems with light. *Clean and grease your chains every 15 days. *Learn how to manage speeds (hint: if you have the big wheel gear and big pedal gear at the same time, this is bad), or better yet, choose an Alfine 9 or 11 hub. *Really think about rain clothing: I use a sort of orange poncho in coated canvas + overboots (Dutch equipment). You need to be sufficiently covered, but maintain adequate ventilation. *If you want to last, always be defensive and prepare to be treated like a dangerous object. *Use a quality lock and ALWAYS attach your bike to a fixed object.	fr

"In Mayotte, violence takes major proportions. Did you forget to insult me for the last time and call me a xenophobic???   > It's exactly what you're doing. While you're at it, you even take advantage of the situation for the propaganda of your xenophobic theory. It's not a theory it's reality. It's precisely what you don't understand. It's not a question of thinking this or that. It's a question of facts.  > That's a good one. A personal attack again, without proofs. If it makes you happy, do comfort yourself with the idea that I believe that ALL strangers are villains. It fits with your Manichean view - either you like every foreigner, and you're cool, or you don't like them all, and you're xenophobic. It's good that you realize your own Islamophobia. You come from the principle that unlike other religions, Muslims are fundamentalists who take the text by the letter. Why are you talking about my pretend islamophobia when, once more, I'm talking about facts, not ideas? And yes I know they're not all fundamentalists thanks. However, it's part of Islam's values, and Muslims live according to Islam. I don't see how worrying about it and underlying it is xenophobic. It's like underlying that Islam is homophobic it to be Islamophobic. Strange no? > Exactly, you don't admit it, it's clearly written above. And it is why you are Islamophobic. Yes, because I understand it the same way that: ""Nazism is antisemitic. Therefore, all Nazis are not antisemitic; you're anti-Nazis"". You defend an intolerant ideology because people practising this ideology are not all intolerant. Either, as I told you, it depends on everyone. But we can't ask the PC to demand more liberalism. > Of course, you can demonstrate that all Muslims are homophobic. Once again, we're getting to the limit of what you believe to be arguments. I only discussed that the ideological basis of Muslims is homophobic. And countries applying this ideology as a way of life, or as the main religion are also homophobic and have laws going that way. You can conclude what you want, but I didn't conclude anything, you can review the conversation.  > We can browse through your history, it's full of xenophobic position.  Not so much. Well, for you to not be xenophobic is not to criticize anybody. So yes, obviously my historic must seem rigorously xenophobic. But is it everyone's opinion (at least it's not the dictionary)  > And it doesn't change that YOUR conclusions are xenophobic. Every time you don't understand anything about what you're told and you do your speech without thinking, it's a little annoying to discuss with you. Even more when you believe that your instrumentalisation can be called arguments. But if my argument have no value and are invalid, why don't you destroy them? Why don't you show me that there is no difference between people. Why don't you show me that every countries share the same culture? And that all culture are equals? Certainly because you can't. So you either attack me at the emotional level (you bad xenophobic), or me directly (my historic). I'm asking you to defend your ideas, and to give arguments. I brought documents that are going my way, it's your turn  >We call that instrumentalising sources, and it's not at all the same. How is that? I didn't instrumentalise anything. I took raw informations and I c/c them. Especially relative to Hofstede. This conclusion is the cherry on the cake. What did I say wrong? I think you really have issues, you see evil everywhere. I feel like you see the world through a filter that minorities are to be protected or are always victims. So I feel like I am bringing forward the flaws of these minorities (at the cultural, values, and religious level) makes you uncomfortable and brings out strong feelings because you have to protect them."	fr

Avoiding a butter shortage. Import ceiling of 13,000 tons for the new year. Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries issues subsidies for protection of dairy farmers, with production being restricted to selected entities to keep the price of milk steady. Doing this nothing will change. Every year the amount of milk produced is set to keep the price of milk just as it is, so if there is an unexpected rise in demand or fall in supply there is no way to make preparations. A season for making preparations is essential and it can only be during winter, so if there isn't enough it can't be produced without being imported. If there's extra then the price of milk will drop so dairy farmers won't make a profit. But the price of milk is kept steady, so the income for dairy farmers is being maxed out, and in the end they'll have no choice but to give up the profession. At any rate, even if butter is imported there are quality protections, so it seems like one thought is maybe it's fine if it isn't produced in Japan.	ja

'Christianity as default is gone': the rise of a non-Christian Europe. This is what I understood, and no, it's not equivalent. Let's put forth (to simplify. These aren't real numbers, ok?) that the indigenous population (non-immigrant) has a stable rate: 100 people in generation 1 give birth to 100 people in generation 2. Let's suppose that the immigrant population is twice as fertile: 100 people in gen 1 make 200 people in gen 2. Let's also suppose that with each generation, you add 100 freshly immigrated people, which makes two children per person (i.e. 4 per woman). Let's count young people coming from immigration, generation by generation: ------------------------------- Scenario 1: descendants from immigrations adopt in one generation the native customs and and start having 1 child per person (= 2 per woman).  1. Begin with 100 gen1  2. Immigration: 100 new gen1 arrive. Reproduction: 200 gen2. Total 100+200=300 3. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 200 gen3 + 200 gen2. Total 100+200+200 = 500 4. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 200 gen4 + 200 gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+200+200+200 = 700 5. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 200 gen5 + 200 gen4 + 200 gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+200+200+200 = 900  There are 200 more people per generation.  --------------------- Scenario 2: descendants of immigrants keep the same growth rate. 1. Begin with 100 gen1  2. Immigration: 100 new gen1 arrive. Reproduction: 200 gen2. Total 100+200=300 3. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 400 gen3 + 200 gen2. Total 100+200+400 = 700 4. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 800 gen4 + 400 gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+800+400+200 = 1500 5. Immigration: 100 gen1. Reproduction: 1600 gen5 + 800 gen4 + 400 gen3 + 200gen2. Total 100+1600+800+400+200 = 3100  Growth is exponential and double with each generation.  -----------------  In both cases, the population is growing, but at very, very different rates. The question is knowing if de-conversion will progress at the same pace.	fr

1914-2018: How Toulouse has become the Toulouse of innovation. Example number 1: at a site where 15,000 people work, you don't have a subway or a tram.

Example number 3: if you still want to get to the site of 15,000 people by public transportation, you only have one bus line from the city center. Positive point (no joke): the subway closes relatively late on the weekend. 3 in the morning, I think, and that's pretty cool.	fr

Dumping Ground Friday - 02/03/2018 I'm finishing the skiing season in Revelstoke, and it was one of the best decisions I've made in my life. In the short term, I'm going to work hard this summer to have the money to maximize skiing for another season. I'd like to go to the Southern Hemisphere and I want to do long trips on splitboards. In the long term, I need to go back to college. I have an idea of the study/book/thesis in social science (a blend of politics, ethics, and economics that deals with leadership, collaboration, hierarchy, and gaming theory). In even the longer term, I need to build a company that will allow me to finance my addiction for powder snow. As someone who's resourceful for fun, I'll need to find an old long and hard snowboard I can cut in half to make a splitboard (you split a snowboard, put on ski style modulable attachements on the bottom of the snowboard and shoes so you can wear it as a snowboard), then I have plans of brewing a guard beer inspired by combined fermentation (saccharomyces, brettanomyces, pediococcus) that they make in the Lambic region.	fr

"How Adam Smith's word has been distorted to serve wild capitalism. > There are exactly 0 economists (including with the Marxists) who think that free and non-faked competition is bad. Most heterodox economist, including Marxists, critique the CPP because it's not doable and its proposal under the pretense of positive analysis has then transformed into a normative proposal. (In short, at the beginning of the liberals, they said they could describe the economy with competition without regulation, but it extrapolated from this positive consequences. Following what many postulates of the hypothetical-deductive method called into question, it then too free and non-faked competition, or CPP, which is similar, as an ideal to be achieved). A lot of economists recuse the possibility of getting there, nor the way of doing things to deregulate markets. Many economists, in certain sectors, want to reduce situations of competition, especially for public monopolies. And also, even certain liberals are abandoning the hypothesis of CPP for a more realistic analysis in oligopolistic competition. > And you'll find nearly no economist who will tell you that globalization is bad. No one will say it like this, but economists will show the negative external aspects of the latest wave of globalization (because globalization is analyzed as a differentiated phenomenon depending on the era). > If you are one and you think that the happiness of a Chinese or Vietnamese person matters less that that of a French or Norwegian person, you just don't get it. It's so simplified. I won't get any deeper into it, but it's not because the BRIICs are experiencing development that globalization doesn't pose a problem, even in countries experience high growth. There the ecological problem, of course, but also problems relating to competition and the fact that it encourages deflation of salaries in a context of globalized competition of the job market. Marx's reserve army could be reactualized, for example. In the time of Keynesian-Fordian capitalism, we had the possibility of increasing salaries at the national scale, but it's more and more complicated with the opening of customs borders. The increase of salaries can quickly be felt in deficit on the commercial scale. > You have to stop confusing ""economist"" with ""asshole American libertarian.""

7 in 10 are in support of abolishing the status of railway workers. I would not want to be alarmist but (yes so I am), the neo-liberal brainwashing is going very well right now. If the subject polarizes the French so much, it is extremely revealing of the current mentality where one prefers to level down the working conditions on the altar of a so-called crisis which mostly affects those who have not much and are ready to do anything to save this small step. If we look at the current state of the world and France, we see that there has never been so much wealth in circulation and which has never been hoarded by as few people today . Not to mention the technological and structural advances that are constantly increasing overall productivity (gains discretely hoarded by a minority), we see that the majority of French people are now convinced that the crisis is the fault of the leaders who have too many benefits. At the same time, the majority of French people expect to work for quite a long time and quite productively by placing the blame on other people. The other people today are the railway workers, tomorrow it will be any status or profession which has working conditions that are not as bad as that. Soon, the vast majority of employees in France will have lower working and living conditions than previous generations. We will see who will be blamed, the older generations who did whatever they felt like, or the bosses who have never been so rich? I have the idea that little old people will be put down or will be forced to live in the street long before the elite ends up letting go of some crumbs to give to the common people.	fr

'Christianity as default is gone': the rise of a non-Christian Europe > Thing that really resembles at all a Caliphate in France. Because you think that Caliphates used to look like Caliphates? Stop fantasizing for two seconds. The Arab conquests were an extreme minority of conquerors from a specific ethnicity (~the Arabs from Hejaz) who imposed themselves by war in countries mostly populated by different and highly varied ethnicities and religions. In fact, it's very similar to the Barbarian conquests in Western Europe. The Franks where Germanic warriors converted to Arianism who went off to conquer an essentially Gallo-Romain country that was still strongly attached to polytheistic cults. Then, the Muslim system was must more flexible than the Christian system with regard to other religions: there needed to be centuries for Islamization of Mashrek to be effective, although it's a region that's at the hear of the Muslim space! Far from the fantasy of aggressive Islam, the history reality is something else entirely. Ask yourself simply how it was that there are still many Eastern Christians in countries that have been Muslim for 1,400 years? Finally, the reality of the Muslim presence in France is a subject that is being worked on in French historiography. We're frankly in a period where it's hard to say anything about the subject because there are more and more discoveries. 20 years ago, we only thought that the Arabs only did raids in France, but now we ralize that Septimania was under the direct influence of Muslim powers and that there were well-established colonies, and that several places in the South have Muslim cemeteries that date to this time. We all know bout the Battle of Poitiers, which is still really far high in France. You need almost cross half the country to get to Poitiers. Anyway, the 5-6th centuries are still a very little-known period in our history. We're going to need to wait a little longer to better fix our historical knowledge.	fr

A people that's dying takes a long time to die. I can't say that I'm a sovereignist, let's just say I'm looking to me convinced et to get a project proposed to me but I think I can answer some of your questions. What are the real reasons keeping the sovereignist movement alive? I see a very big one. The rest of Canada and the people of Quebec don't form a single people. Actually, they are two very different people living in the same country. The biggest difference is culture. We don't have the same culture at all, nor the same references. The rest of Canada doesn't have any idea what's happening with the music industry in Quebec, they don't watch our movies nor our TV. They don't read our books nor follow the same people as we do. The opposite is also true. The only think we have in common is hockey. We don't realy have an emotional tie with the English monarchy. We are more on the left then English Canada. Quebec is less religious. I'm not even speaking about the language that means that Quebec and Canada remain two separate groups that each have their own media, and which increases the differences between them even more. You were speaking of Saguenay and Gaspésie, and of the greater region of Montreal. Theses groups perhaps have their own personalities but they're still strongly connected to the rest of Quebec. They are more of a subgroup than a separate entity. Un link like that doesn't exist with the rest of Canada. When Gord Downie die, I didn't feel anything and I imagine Canada wouldn't care if the same thing happened to one of our celebrities. I could go on but I have to talk about something else. Why should we separate? One of the reasons is that Quebecers can decide what's good for them. Right now, for major pieces of legislation to be adopted (like medically assisted death, abortion, etc.), you need the help of people in Canada (the deputies) that have probably never set foot in Quebec, never watched Quebec media or learned about Quebec culture, and who have no idea what's happening here. To advance, Quebecers constantly have to ask the opinion of people that are very different from us in terms of values and culture. Economically speaking, Quebec would do very well. We are one the most developped economies in the world. To separate wouldn't take away anything from our economic instituations and our industry. There will be an incertainty period like there was in Russia, Germany and that will happen to the UK. I'm convincing myself right now. What about you, HydroRaven, what are your reasons for wanting to stay in Canada?	fr

Criteria for buying a house. In no order, here's my personal checklist: - Flood zone? - Good internet access? (ask for the old telephone number or check with a neighbor) - Talk 5 mins. with each neighbor available (don't hesitate to come back another day without the seller hovering) - When was the roof redone? Does it need to be verified professionally? - Same for the electricity. - Amount of property and housing tax? - In a historical monument zone with restrictions? - Rainwater drainage? - Properly working doors and windows? - Air ventilation? Does it work? - Concrete reinforced column on outer walls/cracks = no - If there's stairs: can a mattress/piece of furniture/whatever you need fit with enough room? - If the house is built from stone, is there concrete rendering outside? Dampness issues and not good for the walls - Distance to your job/bakery/school/supermarket (measured in actual time, not estimated). Don't sign the compromise without having the documents with all the required diagnostics a few days beforehand. You really need to read them with a clear head. They're sometimes very revealing. When visiting: - with every question evaded or answered unsatisfactorily: note it down and ask later. Don't give up on it. - Don't believe anything about what the seller tells you (consider it as an indication) - Laser telemeter to measure anything - Any estimate for the amount of construction is largely underestimated by the seller. No estimate = you don't know.	fr

"Bordeaux: muscular confrontation between students and police \\nIt was 8 pm, the university closes at 9:30 pm. So technically they had the right to be in the premises, especially since they were just talking. Yet, I agree, staying at night is a security problem and there have already been problems with vandalism in this type of case in Bordeaux. But this is not the case, the university completely closes the debate of the selection, which is not a surprise when we know the positions of the president of the University of Bordeaux, because each university apparently has the choice to apply or not the selection, and therefore the students seek to change the president's mind. You will admit that violence against peaceful people is not right ... Even if they do not want to move. Students on the spot reported the following facts: - The students were in a human chain up, sitting - The CRS surrounded them, cornered against the dead wall - The CRS beat them for a quarter of an hour - ""When they they were calmer, they've done hoe stuff, like they tear your bag out, throw it two meters in front of you, ask you to pick it up, while you bend over, strike in the belly """	fr

"Unemployment insurance: Macron's flagship promise is devoid in its substance> It borders on the fake title, the content is not so decided. Oh COME ON. I do not mind defending his darling in politics, no harm in that, but do not worry about the world... we go from a universal unemployment insurance promise to a slight increase in the number of cases where can benefit from it in a truncated way both in terms of the amount allocated and the duration... Yes the promise of Macron is devoid of its substance. As a retired employee, in order to benefit from the unemployment allowance, in addition to the 5-year uninterrupted period, it will therefore be necessary to have a project that imposes professional training, and that this project must correspond to the needs of the labor market, implicit, if you go to do a job out of stress very well, if you go to make your dream of becoming a radio host come true, since there is no special shortage of hosts, vtff. If you want to become an electrician because it requires training it works, if you want to become a community manager you can go and try it. As a freelancer, it's worse. Already, almost all micro-entrepreneurs are not concerned, since they are rarely in liquidation. Whereas the measure had just been presented as planned for them. It also rejects anyone who wants to close their office properly, rather than organizing their bankruptcy and fucking their suppliers. In addition, an annual profit around 10,000 Euros at the same time as a judicial liquidation, good... in general when one sells when they make losses, not profit. And all this for a ridiculous 800 bales per month for 6 months: little more than the RSA + APL (finally... as they still exist it is true) for a ridiculously low time to turn around. Pitiful. Frankly at this rate as much to contribute to a private insurer... Yes the concept of ""universal unemployment insurance"" and the nice speeches of Macron as ""in today's society we can no longer reserve unemployment to only employees while types of work become multiple blahblah there are no more lifetime jobs blahblah have completely disappeared from refereed device. > In 3-4 years, an assessment may decide to change the limit/income, based on the actual impact.

'Christianity as default is gone': the rise of a non-Christian Europe. This is indeed what I understood, and no, it's not equivalent. To simplify (not the real figures, ok?) let's say that the native (non-immigrant) population has a stable rate: 100 people in generation 1 give birth to 100 people in generation 2. Let's say that the immigrant population is twice as fertile: 100 people in gen. 1 make 200 people in gen. 2. Let's also say that with every generation, you add 100 people who have just immigrated, which makes two children per person (i.e. 4 per woman). If we count young people from immigration, generation by generation: ------------------------------- Scenario 1: the descendants of immigrants adopt the native habits in one generation and start producing 1 child per peron (=2 per woman). 1. We'll start with 100 in gen. 1. 2. Immigration: 100 new people in gen. 1 arrive. Reproduction: 200 in gen. 2. Total 100+200=300. 3. Immigration: 100 in gen. 1. Reproduction: 200 in gen 3. + 200 in gen. 2. Total: 100+200+200 = 500. 4. Immigration: 100 in gen. 1. Reproduction: 200 in gen. 4 + 200 in gen. 3 + 200 in gen. 2. Total: 100+200+200+200 = 700. 5. Immigration: 100 in gen. 1. Reproduction: 200 in gen. 5 + 200 in gen. 4 + 200 in gen. 3 + 200 in gen. 2. Total: 100+200+200+200 = 900. There are 200 people more per generation. --------------------- Scenario 2: The descendants of immigrants keep the same growth rate. 1. Start with 100 in gen. 1. 2. Immigration: 100 new people in gen. 1 arrive. Reproduction: 200 in gen. 2. Total: 100+200=300. 3. Immigration: 100 in gen. 1. Reproduction: 400 in gen. 3 + 200 in gen. 2. Total: 100+200+400 = 700 4. Immigration: 100 in gen. 1. Reproduction: 800 in gen. 4 + 400 in gen. 3 + 200 in gen. 2. Total: 100+800+400+200 = 1500. 5. Immigration: 100 in gen. 1. Reproduction: 1600 in gen. 5 + 800 in  gen. 4 + 400 in gen. 3 + 200 in gen. 2. Total: 100+1600+800+400+200 = 3100. The growth is exponential and doubles with every generation. ----------------- In both cases, the population is growing but at very, very difference paces. The question is knowing if de-conversions will progress at the same pace.	fr

Some twenty ex-deputies of the Bloc call for the departure of Martine Ouellet. If you have to leave the members decide who is right. I'm cool for Martine to move to all-in independence. Anyway, given that no one gives a fuck in Ottawa, we'll get on it and there won't be one of the like 50 deputies of the PLQ or the 15 deputies of NPD who'll say a word. The Bloc serves as a guard dog, but no one is listening. The problems with sharing power in a confederation and their abuses doesn't interest young people or older people at all. I'll never vote anything besides for the Bloc, or like Rhino or an indpendent, Boulerice and his gang can just go and eat shit. Also, leave with a bang if the same thing happens. This will make one fewer sovereignist party, with ON, which is dead, there will just be the PQ and QS. I think it's sad as well that the death of the Bloc causes laughs and insults. It's a piece of our history that's leaving, and the Bloc deserves to leave with honor.	fr

"You've been caught red-handed manipulating or faking the news (speech by Bannon to the FN). Agree with you generally. Especially these hasty accusations of racism has stopped the debate for 30 years, but they're necessary for ""sensitive"" subjects such as immigration. However: > Democracy is wavering, not because of these populists. Marine Le Pen and Bannon are themselves specialists in these kinds of manipulations. When they're accused, they reply that they's only adopting the techniques of their adversaries. It's partially true; for example, when you see ""decoders"" criticizing FN, it's ridiculous. It's one ideological back room against another. But this depends on the adversaries, and often, the FN is rather worse (for example, during the Le Pen - Macron debate). In any case, the former protégé of Bannon, Trump, is an absolute disaster in the matter, insulting, lying, manipulating like no one else before him. On Reddit, you've got The_Donald, who is more or less directly a creation of Bannon, and where you can see how little interest for the truth they have every day. Saying that we won't be talking about Bannon anymore in two days means you're quickly forgetting that we'll only be talking about Trump for years, even decade, depending on the level of damage he'll continue to cause. Anyway, all that just to say that I rather agree with you basically, I think that you need to watch out not to greatly worsen things. Denounce manipulation where you find it, including when it affects ""political adversaries."" This is absolutely essential so that democracy can work. Answering manipulation with manipulation, however, can only lead to the general disintegration of society, and this is happening already. Or even, to use this excellent quotation by Dubya: ""Too often, we judge other groups by their worst examples - while judging ourselves by our best intentions."""	fr

A hostage taking underway in an Aude supermarket. When I see the downvotes I realize that Air France is really anti-weapons. And yet, I moderated my remarks by principle. Yes, you’re absolutely right. I’m a shooter so I know that hitting your target is not like in “Call of Duty”, especially when you’re in a stressful situation. This is why, among other things, that I don’t want everybody to have a gun. At a minimum, it requires a bit of training, with checks for both physical and psychological fitness. This is already what is basically required for licensed shooters. But in any case, whatever the situation, you can always imagine the worst. I didn’t say, “arm supermarket staff”. I was just trying to understand a different point of view, not based on “bang bang bang I have a gun I’m invincible”. In short, this is not the place to talk about that, too bad. Let’s stay hoplophobic by principle, like good Frenchmen.	fr

In Mayotte, violence taking dramatic proportions > Yes, if you prefer to say it like that. I'm still convinced that it's a reality because it's precisely to avoid these problems of incompatibility that such a measure was invented. You explain in your previous comment that this isn't the case and that you're the one who drew this conclusion. Make a choice. > Deep down, do you really think that differences have no influence? This phrase makes no sense. Influence on what? > If I may, have you ever traveled outside of Europe? No, really, what is this question? > Note that people are similar in every respect on the human level. We share the same feelings. We're human. Are you holding a cliché contest? Sorry, you call these arguments. > Yet when you observe more closely the functioning of society, you notice that people have very different ways of organizing themselves and thinking, which is cultural. And certain cultures may clash in various points. So what? It's just an empty phrase that does strictly nothing. > Well, same if you want to formulate it like that, go ahead. I believe that there are countries that are more compatible with each other than certain others, due to differences between the population. If you think this means that there are those that I don't like, go ahead. You never stop criticizing and wanting to create a ranking. > And there are bad ones. It's the same as everything with two sides. Well, I won't say that it's positive or negative. Yet you only comment on the negative. By chance, I think not. > It's a dual problem, yes. Religious and social. And took some time in France as well. But I know that mentalities change because young people who identify as Muslims as soon as they're born, don't allow themselves to do this because they're in a society that encourages freedom of religion, unlike many others. We aren't defined as this or that from birth. We're defined as such much later when you define yourself, as long as you have acquired speech. I don't see at all what you're getting at. > It's possible that felt that I was generalizing. I didn't feel that. I observed it by reading and this didn't just start today. You systematically spit out the same xenophobic and Islamophobic trash. > I'd like to know what you like about this. That you tell me concretely what you think. If you think that all societies are worthy if their values are equivalent, if you think that mixing people has no social consequences, etc. I simply think that this classification is a stupid approach that will result in nothing useful. All societies are the fruit of exchange and mixing, and being for or against this means absolutely nothing. I think that we have other things to worry about besides basing this on ethnic origins in order to progress. What counts is actions, whether you're a French or Senegalese asshole changes nothing the problem. An asshole should be treated as such no matter his origin. > You're completely right to point this out. I could have used the example also but the subject doesn't have to do with them (we could have been talking about Chechnya after all). Anyway, yes, I condemn them just as much. All religions do shit to people - all of them - Christianity and the others. You do indeed need to do this because I never see you do it, which is why we can speak about phobia. It's always against Muslims or Africans. I see homophobes as homophobes, not as Muslims or participants in Manif Pour Tous. It's much more effective to deal with the problem. > In addition to this, it is clearly observed because they deal with homosexuals who are just as intolerant. And no, I'm not obsessed with Muslims. We're only debating. I'm not obsessed with every subject I bring up. You always bring up the same subject with the same targets while you claim the contrary. Do it with everyone and then we'll talk. You've put up who knows how many comments explaining me that Muslims were the most awful people in the world, and you even theorized this. We can talk about obsessions. I'm against this kind of discourse, and I attack it when I see it. You're not the only one I'm replying to. > Yeah, it's a bit clearer. But anyway, I'm trying to point out as I can that if we leave the benefit of the doubt for one ideology, why not for another? Because some of them organized the final solution, and others didn't. Not to mention their ideology, which is only a set of racist theories and other nonsense about a superior race. There's no relation. > Ok, again, it's the wrong question because you can say that Nazism relies on the hierarchy of races, but Islam doesn't. There you go. > But perhaps you understand what I mean. No, not really, I don't think that you'll find an example that works. > Waiting for Christians or Muslims to be tolerant toward homosexuals, for example, while their religion says the opposite. I don't see how this is supposed to happen unless people give up religion, and again, this may stay present in society for a long time. I shit on religions, but it would be dishonest to say that some religious people have not evolved and that others are not able to adapt to an open and tolerant world. If this wasn't the case, given the number of believers, we'd constantly be at war and the planet would be fire and blood. > I'd like to know your opinion on this thing. For you to tell me concretely what you think. If you think that all societies are worthy, if values are equivalent, if you think that mixing people has not social consequences, etc. Like I said above, I think this question has no sense and does nothing. If we focus on France, I don't think that the real problems are related to immigration, whether it's from near or far. It's just a rag to shake to occupy the kids so they won't search for the real cause of their problems. And these causes are related to the structure and values of our society. > Let's say that this doesn't really concern me that much because I don't have to deal with it personally. But otherwise, yes, this may concern me, especially if they are discriminated against due to a religion because what I don't like is religions. It's a bit of an admission of instrumentalization. I'd believe you the day when I see you indeed use as much energy trashing other religions besides Islam. Also, this would surely allow you to see that the problem is religion and that they all must be fought together, not by taking them one by one and ranking them against each other. > I especially insist on this point to show that there are ways of thinking and organizing different societies all over the world, which has an impact on levels of tolerance. And there has been progress and setbacks in in every region of the world. > We could speak about tolerance toward Jews as well, for example. Like countries that systematically refuse Israeli passports. I think that a country that commits war crimes and doesn't respect resolutions should be sanctioned. Israeli is a nationality, not a religion. I don't think that these countries would accept Muslims or Jews as long as they have an Israeli passport. Saying that it's intolerant to Jews means you're making a more than suspect shortcut.	fr

Bitcoin and almost all forms of virtual currency are losing value fast. There was also a short time when all transactions were suspended.

There is no value in using it and the tax cost is enormous. Therefore, it is hard to use it on transactions and can only become an object of investment.

Are women paid less than men for the same work?  > we could also wonder why we don't value profession chosen by women, that are beneficial to society, even if all this is true. I don't think we devalue their profession more than men's voluntary, this is a case-by-case situation, and you should be able to find profession valued/devalued for both sexes. A plumber will be valued when a hairdresser will not. A nurse will be valued as well as a policeman. (I voluntarily included professions in majority gendered by society for both sexes). However, we can say that professions with a majority of women are paid less most of the time. And I think (my thoughts only uh, if you don't agree I'll be happy to discuss it with you), it's related to two things. The dangerousness of the profession (work-related accidents/deaths are in majority practiced by men). And a capitalist world. Culture-related professions (with a majority of women) generate less value (in euros, not as a value for society/education or other) than industry related professions (with a majority of men) for example.	fr

"December 29, the New York Times used the first and eighth pages to publish the long article ""She Broke Japan’s Silence on Rape"". The article was about how the mainstream Japanese media turns a blind eye. We need to break down the silence regarding rape in Japan (NYT article translation). It is being broadcast online. People who only watch the mainstream media in Japan won't be reached even if the NYT reports on it. Is it even conceivable that a NYT broadcast could bring about a change to the mainstream Japanese media? Well, I guess it basically has no effect."	ja

"Compiègne: the kids deal drugs, the whole family is kicked out of the housing > But here, the goal, and they say this in the article, is to ""set an example"" and to dissuade others from doing the same.

I know it's probably difficult to imagine for some, but not everyone has this possibility. In particular, in the suburbs/ZEP (priority education zones) with a very high rate of school failure and a lack of jobs (that will only worsen with rampant true free-market neoliberalism that we've had from government to government). The ""just strap your boots and just find a job"" is, to be honest, populist discourse from the extreme right. > The mother pays the consequences, but they’re her kids. Not strangers. Shit, just pray that you never have kids who screw up with your logic. Oh no, of course, you’ll magically be a better parent who will succeed in everything and never have any problems raising your kids, sorry /S > This will probably be a firm penalty 10 x higher than what he’s risking. When I was talking about the right that is becoming radicalized and prefers to resort to brutality by claiming that it works without solving anything about reality, you’re the perfect example. Then, are you going to cut off their hands as long as we’re here? > And then? Do you prefer to assign housing to a family of 2 parents and 4 (older) kids, 3 of whom deal drugs, or the same, but without dealing? Both questions have nothing to do with this. The right to housing is one thing. Don’t mix up the crimes of an individual with those of his neighbors. Another thing, address this problem of drugs with the third thing, which is still separate. > Might as well kick them out and bring in another family into the residence.

BPIFrance bets 25 million euros on a dirigeable for transportation. I'll never understand how you can still inject money into this stupid tech in the 21st century. Dihydrogen will never be used again because it's much too dangerous, will necessarily and up like the Hindenburg, and using quantities of helium for transporting freight is just obscene. Helium is an endangered resource, which has more important applications elsewhere than doing what a train or truck can do, like MRI and lots of other scientific instruments. Also, this is why transportation via zeppelin is expensive: the price of helium, and it's not going down soon. BPIFrance is loyal to its reputation of wasting public money in idiotic and at best, useless projects that try to reinvent the wheel and that will never work, like Qwant.	fr

What’s the deal with Macron? 1. You have to understand that when you tax people too much, like Hollande wanted to do, then people leave the country. 2. Rights are so reduced that unemployment has dropped (which was not the case before when we had all the rights) 3. Demagogy without any arguments: already the SNCF will remain public and we have to think that a company with such debts needs to be reformed. From +pk the railway workers should escape the reform of the public service. 4. So, there’s no hypocrisy: to better welcome people, you have to welcome fewer people. It’s a mathematical principle, and if the police bothers the migrants, it’s not for nothing (i.e. the Mayor of Calais who said in an interview that migrants are not all nice). Moreover, this reform and more largely the limitation of immigration is welcome by the majority of French people.	fr
