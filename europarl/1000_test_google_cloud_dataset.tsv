In some Member States, it is not simply a matter of informing an opinion that is not as well informed as it could be. That is certainly important, but it is also a matter of combating the disinformation spread by a very active anti-European movement and existing anti-European organizations. The Commission will have to be very vigorous in its responses to certain comments that will reach it as part of this campaign. Mr. Corbett, thank you for your appreciation. I gladly accept your invitation and, if I understand correctly, you would like me, when I come to Yorkshire, to discuss not only the reform of the European institutions, but also the structural funds. I will therefore come to perform this dual task. I forgot, moreover, to mention my concern to go, and I have already done so, before the national parliaments, not only by meeting their representatives here, but by going to see them in person. Ten days ago, I was in Westminster. You see, Mr. Corbett, that I am not afraid of difficulties. I am going to the Bundestag in Berlin next week. I have appeared before the French Senate. So, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will also go directly to the national parliaments. Dialogue with citizens is not about propaganda or marketing, not even communication. I would like this dialogue to be truly a dialogue, and after a short film objectively explaining the issues of institutional reform, those here in the gallery can intervene and respond with an open microphone. We are going, I repeat, to conduct this dialogue initiative in ad hoc or structured cooperation with the Member States, and I very much hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will be able to join in this dialogue initiative, according to the terms they deem most appropriate and most suitable. Mr President, I would like to join the study circle set up by Mr Barnier, which includes 700 trainees, so that he has people to talk to. It is hardly pleasant to have to discuss issues of transparency or issues relating to the Intergovernmental Conference individually. Regarding the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier stated during his presentation to the House that social policy would not be decided by majority vote, but I note from page 63 that the fight against discrimination, freedom of movement and the right of residence – that is, the directives on the right of residence – all of social security, the renewal of Regulation No 1408, and social policy measures will be voted on – with a few exceptions – by qualified majority vote. Does Mr Barnier care that he is attacking the very heart of the legislative process in the Member States? It is to defend these issues that people go to the polls to determine a new majority in the Danish parliament, or in any other parliament. Can these issues be managed by Brussels? Are we here in the process of decentralization that Mr. Prodi spoke to us about this morning?	fr
Here are two simple examples of the real problems behind the slow pace of the European justice system; delays in this field can cause serious personal hardship and sometimes even tragedy. I am not saying that our national legal systems are perfect, but all too often they have to wait for a preliminary ruling from the European Court. Statistics show a worrying trend towards longer waiting times for preliminary acts: I am not blaming the Court or its staff for anything, but rather criticising the structure of the Court itself and the lack of resources at its disposal in a rapidly expanding European Union. The proposals in this report are certainly acceptable as a temporary palliative, but Europe is a legal construct, for the proper functioning of which the courts are an essential element. In view of the forthcoming enlargement, the IGC must implement a radical reform and restructuring of the judicial system; otherwise we, as elected representatives, will have to deal with the growing dissatisfaction of our citizens who cannot obtain justice quickly and effectively. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report. I also fully agree with his conclusions, especially where he proposes to increase the number of référendaires of judges at the Court of First Instance and to give it its own translation service. I believe that this is indeed necessary because we heard - when we were visiting the Legal Affairs Committee in Luxembourg - that, naturally and by virtue of decisions taken so to speak from above, when it comes to using a common translation service, the Court of Justice enjoys a certain priority over the Court of First Instance which consequently often fails to deal with important issues. However, I am also of the opinion that reforms must go beyond what we are about to decide here at this moment. For example, it is worth starting to reflect on those areas in which there already exist judicial bodies that operate in a similar way to the courts and on a preliminary basis: it is enough to remember Alicante, or what is provided for in the law on the European civil service. The Court of First Instance, after having assigned the necessary competences, could therefore become the last instance. In my opinion, we should also take action on the Commission's attitude towards renationalising, i.e. bringing decisions on competition matters back to the national level. I think we need to think about this, since these cases will no longer reach the Court of First Instance but will have to be examined, when documents are produced, directly by the Court of Justice. We need to think about how to resolve this situation. If necessary, provision should be made for the competent section of the Court of First Instance to examine the production of documents on competition matters. We should also think about whether it is right or not - we have even had cases of Members of Parliament or parliamentary groups who have brought actions against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to have jurisdiction over these matters, although in reality these are constitutional issues which, strictly speaking, should be the responsibility of the Court of Justice rather than the Court of First Instance.	it
"If this is the role the Commission intends to play over the next five years, we, convinced federalists, are certain that this is not the right path, and in this regard, we will ask for explanations and judge what the Commission intends to do. Reform is important, but if it leads to a weakening, reduction, and diminution of the Commission's supranational powers, the consolidation of European integration, which the Founding Fathers intended for the European Commission, is at stake. Mr. President, regarding the other points, for example, that of economic and social policy: it is true that the European social model is undergoing a profound crisis. It is true that the problem of unemployment is no coincidence the number one problem that none of our policies have managed to resolve. But it is not true that it can be resolved by formulating a list of the problems we addressed in the past, without having a clear vision, a proposal, a proposal by virtue of which, in our Europe, there are economies that are advancing at one of the most sustained paces, and it is no coincidence that these are the economies that have managed to make flexibility in the labor market and businesses their number one objective. If we continue to get bogged down in proposals that have yielded poor results to date, I do not know what we will do or what the Commission will be able to do. The same applies to enlargement itself, without it being linked to a much more effective reform of the European Union and its structures, as well as to proposals that the Commission could have formulated even within the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference. Mr. President, I would like to say something positive, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members, about the telegram you sent to the Austrian Government. Your position has convinced us: you were right not to further isolate that country. Nevertheless, we will see what the concrete gestures will be in practice. I repeat, Mr. President, in our opinion, this is a somewhat short-sighted vision. Above all, there is a lack of impetus in the areas I have mentioned, for example, regarding the Balkans. Is it possible to continue leaving the Balkans out of enlargement, without considering that Croatia, Macedonia, and other countries also have a right to be part of this common House? Madam President, Mr. Prodi, I would like to commend your proposal for a radical decentralization of the Union's activities and ask you why you are then presenting a legislative catalogue that centralizes. I remind you of your predecessor's speech five years ago. Like you, he promised ""less and more,"" and Mr. Santer ended up delivering ""much more and much worse,"" and I don't think you can deliver what you promise either. You talk about decentralization and centralize. The legislative catalog is a long list of areas where citizens lose influence and where you, Mr. Prodi, take it away from them, even in social matters."	es
The fourth point, which Mrs. Hedkvist Petersen just emphasized, is the promotion of a policy of equal opportunities for women and young people. The fifth point is the importance and role of small and medium-sized enterprises, as Mr. Vatanen said very vehemently just now. Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the Structural Fund management system, the motivation of officials when they manage these Funds, even if it is sometimes complicated, and the importance of making further improvements to the Commission's evaluation, monitoring, and control procedures. I would like to inform the European Parliament in this regard of my intention to organize a seminar in mid-2000 with national and regional authorities on this issue of evaluating procedures for exchanging good practices in the management of the Structural Funds. I would like to raise a few specific points. Mr. Berend, you expressed the wish that zoning be implemented quickly. We are putting an end to zoning. Tomorrow, four new countries will be the subject of a Commission decision, and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy's turn. So, you will be satisfied on this point, since all the countries covered by Objective 2 will be zoned. Regarding the underground economy that you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject rely on the reliability of the data, and as Mr. Cocilovo mentioned, there is a problem with the reliability of these data. To a certain extent, they are taken into account in statistics on GDP and labor force surveys, and in any case, I would like to emphasize the efforts that Eurostat is making and will continue to make to improve the quality of statistics. You also mentioned, Mr. Berend, like Mr. Aparicio Sánchez, the lack of reform in the fisheries sector. On this point, which is of personal interest to me, I would point out that the small size of this sector - which does not mean that it is negligible - and its concentration in a very small number of regions do not make it easy to analyse it within a regional framework. This type of sectoral analysis is more a matter of practice and the competence of the Directorate-General for Fisheries, under the authority of my colleague Mr Fischler. However, I would like to assure you that the Commission will endeavour to include such an analysis in the second cohesion report, which will undoubtedly be more suited to these concerns. Several of you have mentioned points that should be included in this second cohesion report, and your rapporteur has touched on some of these points. I would first like to assure you that the merger of the periodic reports and the cohesion report should not lead to any loss of information or loss of interest in the content of this cohesion report which, for me, Mr Rapporteur, is an extremely important instrument, not only to account for what is being done and to say so in a transparent and rigorous manner, to examine or evaluate future directions, but also to create a public debate with citizens and, beyond that, with the elected representatives that you are, on this regional policy and on what a European regional planning policy could one day be.	fr
What criteria will the Commission use to accept or reject these Member States' programs? Which Community body will monitor the financing of the Steering Group and the Monitoring Committee, as well as the correct and proper implementation of the program? Given that the European Social Fund's contribution for the period 2000-2006 amounts to EUR 2.487 billion, and the EQUAL initiative is co-financed by the Member States, will the Commission state how much Greece's contribution will be? The EQUAL initiative is not limited to specific groups of people. It aims to combat discrimination in the labor market. The initiative was adopted in Berlin, and there it was also determined that the relevant measures must also take into account and include professional groups of asylum seekers. I would like to emphasize this important element of the initiative. The Member States' programs drawn up within the framework of the Community initiative must comply with the provisions of the Social Fund Regulation. The EQUAL initiative is therefore subject to the Social Fund Regulation. It has been submitted to Parliament, and we expect its opinion next month. I must stress that EQUAL responds to national needs and plans, which are defined in accordance with the agreed European strategy. The Member States or national governments are primarily responsible for setting up the joint implementing bodies, submitting proposals, selecting those who will implement the programmes, and monitoring them. Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation, and budgetary control is naturally also carried out by the Directorate-General for Financial Control, the Anti-Fraud Office, and the European Court of Auditors. A final part of the question concerned the amount of the contribution made available. Greece has been awarded ECU 98 million. The grant amounts to 80%; in the case of island regions, particularly the remote Greek islands, the initiative contributes up to 85%, with the own contribution being 15%. Mr President, in my view, the guidelines for the EQUAL Community Initiative, and in particular the four actions they lay down, result in a very complicated, bureaucratic and, paradoxically, also non-transparent structure. For example, one wonders how a development partnership is supposed to prove that it meets the conditions of cooperation and representativeness, as required in paragraph 33 of the instructions for Action 2. On the other hand, the obligation to transnational cooperation and the complex requirements for planning and implementing development partnerships inevitably lead to large-scale projects, since only they can meet these conditions. This, however, contradicts the declared intention of focusing the general objectives on decentralised action plans, at the level of local authorities and in agricultural regions. At the same time, the participation of the truly disadvantaged, namely asylum seekers, immigrants and others, is made impossible or reduced to a symbolic level. Finally, given the small total—€2.8 billion for 15 Member States and such ambitious targets—I fear all we'll be able to do is demonstrate the evil that unemployment is. Since we're now at the drafting stage in Parliament, I would like to say, first, that it would be truly helpful in every way if you could put forward concrete proposals that we can consider.	de
I appreciate Parliament's flexibility on such a sensitive and complex issue as water service charges. I fully support the call for water prices to be set so as to provide incentives for users to use water resources sustainably. I also support the idea that each economic sector should contribute appropriately to covering the costs of water services and can therefore accept Amendments 43-46 and Amendment 85 in part and in principle. I believe we need legally binding rules requiring each economic sector to cover the costs of water services. This provides a clear economic objective against which progress can be measured. I therefore support the overarching objective of Amendment 105, which reflects the Commission's original proposal. I also support a gradual move towards covering environmental and resource costs. We are aware that the pricing of water and water services is an extremely complex issue and that it must take into account not only environmental but also social and economic objectives. However, this must not be used as an excuse for subsidising polluting and inefficient economic sectors. A Commission communication is planned for the near future that will address precisely this issue. I agree with Parliament that the 16-year period for implementation of the directive specified in the common position must be significantly shortened. The same applies to the possibility of an extension of a further 18 years. Amendment 28, which deletes the third extension, represents a step in the right direction and can therefore be adopted. On the other hand, a period of 10 years, as proposed in Amendments 24 and 26, among others, is too short. In my opinion, consideration should be given to including an explicit and mandatory provision to prevent deterioration in the overarching definition of the draft's requirements. The draft must also include stricter criteria for extending deadlines for heavily modified or artificial water bodies, as well as for setting less stringent environmental objectives. This concerns Amendments 6, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 78, 80, 102, and 104. These can be accepted in substance and are supported to achieve a comprehensive solution. However, the requirement in Amendments 27 and 29 that the Commission must agree to any extension goes too far and therefore cannot be accepted. Another important area is the protection of groundwater. To break the current upward pollution trend, we need both a starting point and an end goal. Stricter criteria for interpreting monitoring results are equally essential. The most important sections of Parliament's Amendments 25 and 73 can therefore be accepted in principle. However, the new definition in Amendment 72 is too strict and cannot be used for these purposes. I propose incorporating Amendment 92 into a broader solution. Amendment 71 does not take into account seasonal variations or annual changes in the groundwater level.	de
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has played a pioneering role in affirming human rights within the European Union. We know that governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik, to commercial, geostrategic, or economic interests. We have defined conditions for states that wish to join our Union, and we must also define conditions for the states whose candidacy we support. Because we are among those who believe in democracy and its values. We know that freedom of the press and public information are the lungs of democracy. The air of freedom of the press must breathe through a democratic state. And democracy must also go hand in hand with free and informed public opinion. And there is no free and informed public opinion without unsupervised social communication, and there is no free and unsupervised social communication if journalists are prosecuted, arrested, or threatened. Mr. President, just as we rightly condemned UNITA's actions, which have undermined the peace process in Angola, and firmly called on both parties to end the war and make peace, we now condemn the persecution and threats and call on the Angolan government to allow journalists to work freely, as this is the prerogative of a democratic state and society. Mr. President, how much longer can we continue to cooperate with Angola? Human rights are systematically and persistently violated there, not only by UNITA but also by the government itself. The trials against journalists violate all legal principles. The Angolan government must immediately authorize a significant UN presence to act as an intermediary and inform us about human rights. Similarly, European observers must be allowed to attend the hearings of the journalists' trials. Europe, despite being a major donor, has so far remained too passive towards Angola. If the Angolan government continues to refuse to cooperate, we will have to take measures. Without national reconciliation, no reconciliation with Europe is possible. Angola will then remain, alas, a diamond in the rough. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I completely agree with the resolution being discussed in Parliament; I agree because the situation of repression affecting journalists, whether Angolans or foreign correspondents in Angola, is so serious and scandalous that we cannot turn a blind eye. But this resolution is insufficient, because in reality, it assumes that Angola is a state governed by the rule of law, which imposes certain difficulties on journalists and represses them. But that is not the point. Angola is not a state governed by the rule of law; it is a repressive dictatorship. Angola is at war, a cruel and protracted war. And we cannot accept the prevailing theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated in order to achieve peace. Therefore, the repeated appeals of the Angolan Church, the appeals made yesterday, for example, by Mandela and Mebeki for new peace negotiations to begin, must be supported by Parliament. We must therefore undertake, as another colleague has already said, a general debate on Angola, and not just on the situation of certain journalists who are victims of repression in Angola.	fr
The financial resources with which the Council has allocated this cultural program contrast sharply with the importance that cultural and education policy and the program have for the objectives pursued by the European Union. Cultural activity creates an identity. Cultural activity is the expression of individuality, it is the expression of one's personality, it builds relationships and establishes communication. We want a diverse Europe. We want a Europe founded on the principle of diversity in unity. We want people to understand and learn to value differences. For this reason, we have spoken out in favor of the distribution of the budget and the allocation of resources to different types of measures. For this reason, we have rejected the heavy concentration of resources in large networks and network structures. We want to encourage small and medium-sized units, individual activity, because we want to make thousands of flowers bloom. I echo the words of the previous speakers. We are faced with a genuine contradiction—the principle of unanimity, the codecision procedure, and the Conciliation Committee—if what we want is to strengthen the principles of cultural policy in favor of a European conscience instead of further weakening them. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you have heard, we all have, regardless of the political group to which we belong, a common political enemy: the Council. Decisions of the Committee on Culture almost systematically end up in the conciliation procedure, since there is always some Member State that takes culture hostage in exchange for other interests. In other words, the principle of unanimity appears to be a first-rate blocking instrument. The struggle for an acceptable compromise lasted almost two years, until the European Parliament was finally able to give the green light. Not even the expiration of the previous programs, Kaleidoscope, Ariadne, and Raphael, could soften the Council's position. The need to create a pilot transition program prevailed. All of this has once again highlighted the weaknesses of the European Union's cultural policy activities. The political battle over funding and program design is completely disproportionate to the funds allocated. Of the 410 applications submitted in 1999, only 55 projects were retained, for a total of just €6.07 million. In the context of this program, the Council was unwilling to give Parliament a single euro! The result is that until 2004, we were left with a modest €167 million. This is equivalent to the expenses incurred by a single medium-sized German opera house over the same period. In Europe, however, this amount is reserved for 29 countries and a period of five years. This is a huge disproportion! Despite our anger, we must be content with the progress made in the area of content. This is something we have made clear and is worthy of gratitude. We hope that one day the Council will be convinced and change its attitude.	es
This would jeopardize a greater number of jobs, as well as the credibility of this House by showing how far removed we are from the real world. I therefore urge this House to reject the entire report and not to make any amendments to the Commission's original proposal, which was excellently balanced. Mr. President, we cannot vote in favor of this report. Indeed, the European Union should place social issues at the heart of its construction. It is social rights that should govern economic choices, not the other way around. This is why we are opposed to the establishment, regarding social protection, of mechanisms copied from the Luxembourg process that run counter to this logic: broad economic guidelines, then convergence criteria, and finally, social issues, which are treated as a residual issue. The European Union should affirm a general principle: social rights acquired in the States cannot be reduced. Any Community intervention should aim to supplement, and then harmonize upwards, existing guarantees. To strengthen the financing of social protection systems, we need a policy of general wage increases and the introduction of a statutory minimum wage in each Member State. To combat poverty, the right to an income and the right to employment are inseparable. Finally, to prevent any commodification of health care, the European Union should take a clear stand against pension funds and oppose private insurance companies having access to the health system. In conclusion, I truly believe that social Europe cannot be satisfied with just speeches and pious wishes. The situation is too tragic for millions of people. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the objective of developing a concerted strategy to modernize social protection within the European Union is certainly a good thing, as was the launch, with the Luxembourg Summit, of the European convergence strategy for employment and employment policies. The labor market and social protection are in fact two sides of the same coin, requiring the synchronization of policies and regulations. If the labor market is efficient in terms of employment levels, flexibility, and wage efficiency, the welfare state and social protection cannot fail to be so, and vice versa. Previously, European countries each defined, in near-autarky, the rules for the operation and financing of the two markets. Fiscal and exchange rate policies were in place to ensure internal and external balance. With Maastricht and the single currency, fiscal policies have been severely limited, and it is no longer possible to resort to devaluation or seek lost margins of competition. Structural and cyclical gaps between countries can therefore no longer be made up for through deficits and exchange rates. As things stand, in the absence of full job mobility within the Union and a redistributive tax policy at the confederal level, the only degree of flexibility left is in the labour and social protection markets to rectify both structural and cyclical imbalances, the so-called asymmetric exogenous shocks.	fr
In recent months, since I last appeared before the European Parliament, important events have taken place, including within the European Union. Allow me to recall two of them, one of which is very welcome to all MEPs and in particular to the Presidency: the inauguration of the Intergovernmental Conference, and the opening of negotiations with the future members of the European Union. We must certainly recall the events in Kosovo and in the Balkans in general, which have touched our feelings and our intelligence; important issues in the Middle East, where the President of the Parliament played a significant role in her last trip; some important events to unblock the summit between Europe and Africa, in which I had the honour of participating, in cooperation with the Portuguese Presidency; the large meeting that took place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America, to try to build deeper relations also between the European Union and the countries of Latin America. Without a doubt, Chechnya has also been close to our hearts, and I will end my speech by saying a few words about this, in the light of an important conversation I had this morning with the representative of the Council of Europe, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, about his recent visit to that region. However, I believe that the Members of this Parliament have requested my presence to speak more directly about foreign policy and especially security policy in Europe after Helsinki. I will dwell briefly on this subject; I will then be happy to answer any questions that the honourable Members may wish to put to me. Let me remind you that the Helsinki Summit under the Finnish Presidency took place just two months ago, and not a century ago. Fundamental decisions for foreign and security policy on our continent were taken in Helsinki. There are mainly three types of decisions, and it is to these that I will refer. The first was the decision to set up, within the European Union, three types of committees for the adoption of decisions on crisis management: firstly, a Political and Security Committee; secondly, a Military Committee, representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries of the Union; and thirdly, decisions on the relations which the European Union should maintain with third countries and with other organisations. I am referring essentially to the relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and to the relations between the European Union and those countries which, although geographically European, are not part of the European Union, or at least not for the moment. I will confine myself mainly to these three points, in order to update Members on what has happened. Firstly, and with regard to the decision-making bodies, this very morning, 1 March 2000, the Political and Security Committee (PSC), established at the last General Affairs Council, met for the first time. Thus, two months after the declaration and decision taken in Helsinki, a PSC meeting is taking place for the first time within the European Union. This morning I had the opportunity to attend, and to see the representatives at lunchtime.	it
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities, because they must be taken into account, under each of the objectives, to varying degrees according to the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions. I would now like to respond quickly to some of the comments you have made, ladies and gentlemen, firstly on the procedure. It is true that the consultation of your House came late. Allow me to remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission, in draft form, in February 1999, following a new procedure designed to facilitate the submission of comments on this text, they were immediately submitted by my predecessor, Monica Wulf-Mathies, to Parliament. However, given the proximity of the European elections, it was only after the final adoption of the text in July 1999 that your House was able to begin examining these guidelines. Arriving in this college, among you, I want, ladies and gentlemen, to assure you that, in the negotiations on the programmes, which are only just beginning - Mr President Hatzidakis asked me about this - for most Member States, your observations will really be taken into consideration. And I can also assure you that, when the Commission adopts the guidelines for what is called the mid-term review, as provided for in the Regulation, the point of view of your Assembly, the one expressed in this report, will also be taken into account. Now, on the substance of the role of the guidelines, Madam Rapporteur, you have stressed that it is indeed within this framework that the aim is to provide guidelines on a certain number of European objectives, often very specific. I will not list them all: the implementation of intersectoral policies, increasing the efficiency of the use of public funds, helping the various partners to build regional or national programmes together, etc. The Commission takes due note of this, but several of these guidelines or questions fall more within the scope of other documents, such as the Vade-mecum or the methodological working document. I would like, in conclusion, to focus on certain concerns that you have raised, Madam Rapporteur. I am thinking, for example, of the idea that the guidelines are not sufficiently specific in their recommendations. This statement in your report must be put into the context of the negotiations last spring. The Commission has adhered to the very wording of Article 10 of the General Regulation on the Structural Funds, which provides that these guidelines are intended to provide Member States with general indicative guidelines, based on relevant and agreed Community policies. This is the very text that I quoted, in quotation marks. Furthermore, the guidelines cannot replace programming, nor ex ante evaluations, which must be the tool used to specify the priorities and effectiveness of these programmes. You then mentioned, Madam Rapporteur, the section on guidelines relating to urban and rural development, stressing that urban development is not sufficiently taken into account.	fr
We will certainly raise the point raised by the honourable Member. We have heard the concerns expressed in this regard, and I will ensure that they are taken into account. Considerable concerns have also been expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage of the area. We will also raise this latter point in our observations. A number of other hydroelectric projects planned by Turkey over the last 30 years have also been the subject of concerns, such as the effect they had on displaced farmers. On the whole, these appear to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily, and I hope that this will prove to be the case with this project, in which the Commission—just to be clear—has no involvement. Question No. 39 of (H-0036/00): Subject: Drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights While welcoming, on behalf of all citizens, the drafting of a Charter of Fundamental Rights, and expressing the hope that it will be able to meet the challenges of 21st-century Europe, I would nevertheless like to ask the Commission the following questions: What are its positions on the content of the Charter? Which citizens is this Charter intended for (those of the European Union or, in the perspective of enlargement, of all European countries, including migrants, etc.)? Will the Charter incorporate the social achievements of the European Union, or will it have a broader programmatic character? What mechanisms will be implemented to clearly translate equality between the two sexes into practice? What is the Commission's view of incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union? Like the honourable Member, the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government to launch the process of drafting a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The Heads of State and Government themselves laid down, in the conclusions of the Cologne European Council, the broad outlines of the content of the Charter. According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights: the rights of liberty, equality and procedure, as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights; the rights reserved to citizens of the Union; and economic and social rights, as set out in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not merely justify objectives for Union action. The Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given to it by the Cologne European Council. However, this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling existing rights from different sources. As I have already had the opportunity to say to this Parliament, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, where appropriate, to adapt and develop these rights, taking into account current circumstances, in particular technological and social developments.	fr
This is absolutely essential. We must also remember that no one voluntarily gives up power, whether man or woman. Men have never wanted to give up their position of power, when they enjoyed it, but very few women have been willing to give up their position of power, and I am thinking here in particular of their position of power with regard to children. I would also like to say in this regard that this is perhaps one of the reasons why there are so few men here today. We would, of course, like to be able to have this debate more or less among ourselves for the same reasons of power politics. What I wanted to emphasize here is that this is a ceding of power on the part of both parties. The Commissioner emphasized that it was necessary to use a combination of many different measures, and she mentioned Finland and Sweden by name. I will just say for the record that she could very well have mentioned Denmark as well. I say this, of course, because I come from Denmark. The Danish government is actually 45% women, which is actually slightly higher than Finland's. We do not have a female president, but we do have a queen, which can in a certain sense be considered equivalent. I would now like to address some of the points mentioned by the Commissioner, namely the question of financial resources. It is absolutely necessary for us to accept the fact that, if women want to achieve equality in the short term, it will cost money. It is also necessary, in the short term, to seek to ensure that our children are cared for and educated responsibly. This raises the question of adequate structures. One may wonder whether traditional industrial culture is truly good, and I am therefore very pleased with the very active participation of the Portuguese minister in the Lisbon conference devoted, among other things, to the development of information technologies. I believe that there are opportunities there, particularly for women, precisely because it is not a question of hierarchy, but rather of horizontal structures. Developments suggest, at least in Denmark, that there are more and more women entrepreneurs. There are two points that have not been mentioned that I would like to mention in conclusion. The first concerns the influence of the media. I think it is very important that we study the stereotypes created by the media. Does this pose a particular problem? I must say that I do not know precisely. I have the impression that it does, but I am not certain. The second concerns enlargement. I think it is very important in this regard to emphasize now that certain requirements must also be set so that the new Member States are represented by both men and women, which will also support women in those countries. I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements, and I agree with the Commissioner when she says that it is time for fine words to be translated into action.	fr
I take this opportunity to ask if the Commission can clarify the reasons for the delay in the Commission's report on the outermost regions, which has been awaited in Parliament for quite some time. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, also for the kind reception she gave to some of our suggestions in her report. Mr. President, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to offer Member States guidance for achieving reform objectives within the framework of programming. However, the objectives formulated by the Commission in this regard, contrary to their purpose of providing guidance, represent more of a catalogue of possible measures within the policy areas. However, their true purpose is to indicate direction and establish priorities. I agree with the rapporteur that, unfortunately, the Commission document contains too few recommendations to Member States on administrative simplification, and I support some demands, such as focusing attention during negotiations on fostering a favorable environment for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are such job creators; clearly establishing targets for alternative sources of financing, including regulations on venture capital and private financing; and creating start-up aid for companies, including new technologies, as well as investments in the field of innovation. I particularly support my group's amendment to paragraph 10, which aims to ensure adequate inclusion of the private sector in the planning and implementation of projects. I would very much appreciate, Ms. Schroedter, if you would include this amendment in your positive arguments, specifically also under the aspect of subsidiarity. Mr. President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we unanimously maintained the view that it was a strategic and priority issue to support interventions from the Structural and Cohesion Funds that worked to improve employment opportunities for the unemployed and equality between men and women. Regrettably, the excellent Schroedter report failed to take this criterion into consideration, despite the abundant evidence—as we will see later in the Berend report—of how these Funds are indeed splendidly helping the most backward regions to close the gap between them and the most developed regions of Europe. They are growing, but at GDP levels. They are growing in competitiveness, but the increase in wealth is not reaching everyone because employment is not rising, and the gap in employment opportunities persists between different regions. Commissioner, read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and make it a priority, because this is the greatest problem facing citizens. And in the review, in the allocation of reserves, please take into account, strategically, employment needs because that, ultimately, is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require. Mr. President, the guidelines must be able to properly orient and strengthen the effectiveness of the programs for the critical seven-year period 2000-2006, so that sustainable development and job creation, especially for women and youth, finally become a reality, and that a balance between social and economic policies and environmental policy is ensured.	es
I will therefore repeat - in the wake of the rapporteur's excellent speech - that LIFE is the only financial instrument for the definition and implementation of a European environmental policy. It is an essential instrument, since it allows innovative actions to be undertaken in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are then taken up and developed by the Member States. This financial instrument is also deliberately democratic in inspiration, being accessible to both government organisations and NGOs. It is for this reason, ladies and gentlemen, that I ask you not to vote for the amendments that have not understood the spirit of LIFE. In fact, LIFE, through associations, can be used directly by European citizens for the benefit of actions of general interest. Several million - and did I say millions - of NGO members recognise in LIFE the Union's desire to build an ambitious policy for the benefit of the natural heritage. LIFE is also the key instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe, which allows us to protect the sites of high biological value in our countries and within which the Member States, in accordance with Community directives, have committed themselves to protecting the natural habitats of rare and threatened animal and plant species, as well as migratory birds. Those who oppose this policy in individual Member States are guilty, in my opinion, of holding back nature protection policies in Europe, which is a shame, since everyone in this House knows that LIFE does not have sufficient financial resources to implement the projects submitted by the Member States, many of which are rejected precisely because of a lack of funds. Let us not forget that LIFE currently represents only 100 million euros per year, equivalent to only one thousandth of the European budget. For information, I would like to remind you that agriculture, which has a real impact on the environment, is allocated - we all know this - 37 billion euros. In this context, my group believes it is vital to increase the funds allocated to LIFE and fully supports Mrs Lienemann's proposal to increase the amount earmarked for LIFE to EUR 850 million, since we are all well aware - and I cannot help repeating this - of the extent of our fellow citizens' expectations with regard to the environment and nature and how hesitant and unacceptable this compromise by the Council on the LIFE budget is, especially since the LIFE programmes have seen the implementation of a great many projects, demonstrating their ability to introduce new practices in the environmental field. The first sustainable development projects are, without doubt, precisely those promoted by LIFE. ? (FR) Mr President, the European Union's environmental programme, which can count on considerable funds (EUR 613 million), raises many questions about the correct use of public funds. A financial instrument of this magnitude must be transparent and effective, unlike what happens in the case at hand for the following reasons: poorly defined selection criteria, ambiguous operations that are not the result of consultation, failure to publish reports, absence of an evaluation policy.	it
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have an important decision to make today. Does the European Parliament support the ecological principle of producer responsibility, according to which manufacturers are responsible for end-of-life vehicles? In Amendment 38, the Christian Democrats answer this question in the negative: car manufacturers and drivers should share the costs exactly. As the Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste, which includes such cost-sharing, shows, this compromise is not working. Packaging still generates significant quantities of waste in the European Union, which also represents an environmental burden. Some Socialists, led by Bernd Lange, consider this principle to be correct, but according to Amendment 45, it should not be introduced until 2010 or 2012. The Common Position mentions 2006, which, in the opinion of the Green Group, gives the automotive industry more than enough time to prepare. I therefore call on my colleagues not to support Amendment 38 tabled by the Christian Democrats and Amendment 45 tabled by some Socialists. If car manufacturers have to bear the costs of recycling their vehicles themselves, they will design them with a view to making them easier and cheaper to reuse. The problem of using plastics in cars will be solved in the future, as PVC will be replaced by bioplastics made from plants, which will ultimately also be cheaper for consumers. For 20 years, the majority of this Parliament has strived to implement European environmental policy even more decisively. Under pressure from the German and French automotive industries in particular, this focus on strictly ecological objectives is now in danger of being lost. I therefore ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote against Amendments 38 and 45. In the Green Group, we broadly support the common position. Mr President, Waste from end-of-life vehicles represents one of our truly major environmental problems, both in terms of the amount of waste and the emission of polluting substances. We in the GUE/NGL Group therefore demand the most comprehensive and consistent regulations in this area. With this directive, we can take a major step forward. However, this presupposes that the Council's position is not dismantled and watered down during Parliament's reading. Some of the amendments tabled would, however, have this effect if adopted. This applies primarily to the amendments proposed by the PPE Group, but unfortunately, in my view, also to some of Mr. Lange's amendments. It doesn't take much imagination to imagine that the automobile industry in certain countries, such as Germany, engaged in intense lobbying before the adoption of this directive. For us, the inclusion of the following principles is crucial: the polluter is liable for the cost. Accordingly, the manufacturer must assume full responsibility, including financial responsibility, for the recycling of the vehicle. There must also be regulations for vehicles in use. We cannot accept any weakening of the Council's position on the entry into force date. The requirements for recycling after a certain number of years, as well as the corresponding percentages, must not be watered down. Furthermore, the use of hazardous substances such as lead must be restricted. We will vote against all amendments that go in the opposite direction in this regard.	de
That is why, dear colleagues, I ask you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange, which will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists because, in fact, they reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while leaving the Member States free to decide how to implement these constraints, since these amendments provide that the systems in place in the Member States, and there are some that work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate. Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the proposal for a directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims, on the one hand, to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to preserve the proper functioning of the internal market in this sector. A word to say that, of course, historic and vintage vehicles must be excluded from the scope of this directive. Cars, I think we will all agree on this, are also part of our cultural heritage. That said, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, that is, the date of application of the directive. The solution proposed by Parliament, namely 18 months after the date of entry into force of this directive, for vehicles put on the market for the first time, is unrealistic. The European vehicle fleet includes several tens of millions of cars that will have to be taken back without having been designed for recycling. The common position was more practicable since it provided for 2006 for vehicles already in circulation. This would also allow companies time to set aside funds to meet these additional expenses. In this regard, I will therefore support, like my group, the common position which represents a balanced compromise, it seems to me, between the constraints on companies and the essential progress in environmental protection. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is faced with an important decision today. Are we committed to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection, or is Parliament willing to accept becoming the servant of the German car industry, as the Florenz, Lange, and other amendments suggest? The credibility of Parliament, one of the pioneers of environmental protection, is at stake. It would be beyond scandalous if the EP were to reverse what the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have proposed regarding producer responsibility and environmental protection. The intention behind the Florenz and Lange amendments is clear: this directive must be annihilated. The proposal for shared responsibility would gut the principle of responsibility and undermine all innovation. By erecting numerous obstacles, they want nothing more than to hinder an ecologically effective material flow management policy; through approvals, they want to delay the implementation of the directives by twelve years or more. This is completely unacceptable. I therefore make a special appeal to German parliamentarians: do not allow a political disaster to unfold today. The red-green government coalition did not cover itself in glory during the debate on the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive.	fr
"However, on behalf of my group, let me make one thing clear: social convergence strategies must not be an alternative to social legislation, but can only represent a very useful complement to what we are developing and what we expect from the Commission in terms of social legislation. The European Parliament should also try to persuade the Council to flesh out the common strategy in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to combat poverty as early as the beginning of 2001. I am pleased that the European Parliament is sympathetic to my group's idea, and I hope, Commissioner, that we can also count on your support. Finally, we are urging the European Parliament, the social partners, and social NGOs to be involved in this process without fail. This strategy is only likely to succeed if it has a broad, democratic basis, and we therefore hope for your support. Mr President, in November of last year, the governments of the EU member states adopted four main objectives, which have already been mentioned today: ensuring that work and a stable income are worthwhile, that pensions are secure and sustainable, that social inclusion is promoted, and that a sustainable, high-quality health care system is provided. These are four objectives formulated so comprehensively that everyone can support them. And it can only be of benefit to us if we appoint a group of senior officials to exchange experience on coordinating and evaluating developments within social and labor market policy. The Commission communication we are debating today formed the basis of the Council decision of November and presents in a balanced way how the debates can be made more informed, how we can gain more knowledge about the challenges that the Member States will face in the coming years in the area of social policy—think, for example, of the increasing ageing population—and where we will feel the effects of enlargement. Major social problems already exist, and public budgets are burdened with high social costs, which poses a problem for many Member States. If no reforms are implemented, there is a risk that the financial basis of social policy will deteriorate. A strong and competitive economy is, after all, the best basis for social security. It is therefore sensible to put these issues on the agenda. In the discussion on the coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the term ""social convergence."" We liberals can support the concept of social convergence when it comes to developing common general objectives within the EU that countries intend to achieve with their national social policies. So, this is not about harmonization, but about common goals. EU countries organize their social policy in different ways. Our traditions are different, there are differences in our cultures, and despite many points of contact, there are also major differences between countries in the nature and extent of social problems. It must therefore be emphasized that social policy is a national matter. Social policy must, of course, adhere to a set of common framework conditions."	de
Therefore, a ceiling must be set for administrative tasks. The committee drew conclusions from these critical remarks. We attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and marginalized people in the social sector, tourism, and small and medium-sized enterprises with the promotion of start-ups in small and medium-sized enterprises, taking into account the necessary economic structural change. The integration of activities within the framework of the Community Initiative with the European Employment Initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for achieving the objectives of the EQUAL program. We emphatically support the innovative approach of forming international development partnerships and organizing the exchange of experience at the European level as an integral part of the EQUAL program. The specific objective of achieving European benefits elevates regional cooperation to the European level, while maintaining cooperation between the most diverse regional actors. This is a good thing, and that is why we supported it. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, it has already been pointed out today that the first URBAN initiative was clearly a success. The fact that this initiative is now being continued as part of URBAN II, albeit with reduced funding, is thanks solely to committed Members of this Parliament, especially—as far as I have heard as a new Member of this Parliament—the rapporteur, Ms. McCarthy, whom I would therefore like to thank most sincerely for her commitment and, of course, also for her report on URBAN II. What is new about the URBAN II initiative is that it has been tailored to small towns and urban districts. This is important because small towns in particular often have fewer opportunities to obtain funding. On the other hand, however, the problems that lead to a strong need for renewal can be particularly concentrated in such towns and cities and can therefore have a strongly negative impact. In order to increase the effectiveness of the individual measures, the number of projects for Urban II has been limited to 50. I consider it important not to rigidly maintain this arbitrarily set numerical limit, but to leave it up to the Member States to decide how many projects they wish to allocate the funding to which they are entitled. However, it is important to ensure that, especially in small Member States, funding is not limited to urban districts of large cities. There, URBAN II would be a drop in the ocean, of dubious success, and would fizzle out. I also believe it is important not to excessively expand the selection criteria for URBAN II and thereby dilute them. A strictly defined catalogue of criteria is a prerequisite for the funded projects to serve as models and to be transferable to other problem cities in the future. Drawing on my own experience in local politics in a legacy industrialized region with many problems, I would like to conclude by asking you, dear colleagues, for your support of two points in the report, which I consider essential alongside the socio-political aspects. First, environmental protection is essential for sustainable urban development and should therefore be a general prerequisite for project funding. Second, the prevention and combating of everyday urban crime and drug-related crime must begin at the local level. They are essential for improving urban quality of life and must therefore also play a central role in the URBAN II initiative.	de
At the national level, we believe it is urgent that taxation of labour and business be reduced to levels equivalent to those prevailing in our competitor countries, but this is a matter for the Swedish Parliament, not the European Parliament. The fact that several countries are seeking different solutions in terms of tax and social protection policy provides an opportunity to adapt these to national specificities and to test different social protection systems. Tax harmonisation at the European level should only take place in exceptional cases, for example for certain environmentally related or capital taxes. We agree that a certain degree of harmonisation is necessary for the internal market to function, but we believe that Amendment 4 goes much too far and is too lacking in nuance. Joint resolution on the sinking of the Erika (RC B5-0181/2000) Mr President, we voted for the resolution concerning the sinking of the Erika in solidarity with the victims of this ecological disaster. However, we denounce the half-hearted nature of the resolution. Simply deploring the disaster and pitying its victims, without taking coercive measures to force Total to repair all the direct and indirect consequences of pollution for which it is entirely responsible, is doing nothing. It is revolting that Total is leaving it to volunteers and local authorities to repair the damage it has caused. It is equally revolting that it is the State that is releasing funds, which are insufficient, which is nothing more than a disguised subsidy to this company with its criminal activities. Simply raising the issue of flags of convenience is avoiding the essential point. Regardless of the flag of convenience Total uses, the guilty oil company is widely known and present in all European Union countries, and the relevant authorities could, if they wished, sequester all its assets until the company pays. And above all, we wish to denounce this economy where, to make additional profit, a company can pollute a region just as it can ruin it by closing factories. Mr. President, on behalf of the Breton Democratic Union, the Breton partner of the European Free Alliance, and in my own name, I call for the adoption of a real policy to avoid new disasters such as the sinking of the Erika. Regulations and means of control must not only be stricter, they must also be rigorously enforced. It has been made clear that a series of actors must clear the floor to ensure that the Erika is the last ecological nightmare on the Breton coast. This is already the seventh time that an oil spill has hit Brittany since the sinking of the Torry Canyon. No other region in the world has had to pay such a heavy price for the transport of polluting or dangerous products by sea.	fr
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur and also point out that in her report she not only welcomes the proposal for a framework decision, but also proposes a number of amendments which have been highlighted in the various speeches we have heard, amendments which supplement or improve the original text, but which we cannot all discuss here in detail. In any case, the aim is to ensure the success of the euro. We must therefore do everything in our power to ensure that this success is not threatened or jeopardised by inadequate measures to protect against counterfeiting – and we are aware of initial attempts to do so. We have all pointed out that the transition phase creates many uncertainties and dangers. In addition to the work carried out against counterfeiting and the regular implementation of the provisions, the planned information campaign must therefore play a vital role. We must continue to devote ourselves intensively to this. These are also questions of cooperation. We need a definition of the precise responsibilities of the ECB, the national central banks, the Commission and Europol in all matters relating to the falsification of the euro. I am also wondering whether an interinstitutional or Community body should be set up to ensure coordination in matters of cooperation. In this connection, there is also talk of setting up a 24-hour early warning system and of establishing a common information system allowing for the rapid exchange of information between the various competent authorities. In addition to this report, the content of which we welcome, many questions still need to be clarified. I hope that the debate we are holding here will provide some of these clarifications. Mr President, Madam Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, to what extent is the euro a safe currency? This is a question we are very frequently asked by the public. This question will of course become increasingly pressing as we approach 1 January 2002, the date on which the euro will be in everyone's wallet. This question of the security of the euro concerns not only the stability and external value of this currency, but also its protection against counterfeiting. These are questions that also affect the population, because this money will be, as has been rightly said, something new for the citizens of the Union, both to the eyes and to the hands that handle it. The fact that this currency will be valid over a much wider area and will be used as the main currency throughout Europe will also be something new for the citizens of Europe. We will have to get used to it. It is therefore clear that we are being asked the question of what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiters. This is precisely what we are debating during this evening session. This is truly a topic of great interest to the public. It is therefore regrettable that it is being addressed at such a late hour. But that is how it should be. Of course, the European Central Bank has been considering this issue for a very long time.	fr
"Furthermore, the Court is of the opinion, Your Honor, that the transfer between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of rational and responsible exploitation of marine and living aquatic resources, since fishing pressure in subdivisions 8 and 9 does not increase or adversely affect the overall share of those resources allocated to Spain. Accordingly, the Council reiterates, Your Honor, its view that, without this transfer, France's fishing opportunities for anchovy in the Bay of Biscay would increase. Therefore, the Council reiterates, Your Honor, its view that fishing pressure would be greater and more detrimental to the stocks than the solution ultimately chosen. Specifically, 3,000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal's fishing opportunities in 2000, compared to 5,008 tonnes, or 73.9%, in 1999. These figures represent, in our view and from the Council's perspective, a real improvement from a conservation point of view, compared with the 80% level laid down in Council Regulation 685/95. Question No 6 by (H-0788/99): Subject: Measures to tackle the continuing ethnic cleansing against ethnic Serbs and Roma in Kosovo The NATO Defence Ministers' Summit on 2 December 1999 issued a strong call for an end to ethnic cleansing against ethnic minorities in Kosovo. The European Parliament, in a resolution referring to certain acts of hateful violence perpetrated against the Serb and Roma population, also strongly condemns the persistent violence against the Serb population of Kosovo and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanian community to fully respect United Nations Resolution 1244. The resolution also emphasizes that the past persecution of the Albanian population cannot constitute ""a pretext for continued killings, abductions, arrests, abuse of power, harassment and intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property, and occupation of homes."" In light of the above, does the Council intend to reconsider funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as requested by the European Parliament? What other practical measures does it intend to take to put an end to ethnic cleansing? Honourable Member, I would like to express my deepest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised. We truly share the concerns that the Honourable Member feels regarding the threat that exists within Kosovo for ethnic minorities, whether in relation to the Serb population or the Gypsy population, and the aspects of discrimination, harassment, and intimidation that continue to occur in that territory. The Council has consistently underscored the need to bring to justice all those who perpetrated such acts and those who continue to perpetrate them. The Council also reiterated, in its December conclusions, the need for the full implementation of Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported the efforts undertaken by Mr. Bernard Kouchner to implement measures that may guarantee effective protection for minorities in that territory and, in particular, the effective implementation of measures that preserve its multiethnic character. In our contacts with leading political figures among the Kosovo Albanians, as was done very recently by the Portuguese Prime Minister, we have emphasized that the persecution of Serb populations, Roma populations, and other ethnic groups is completely unacceptable."	es
It would be beneficial if the Union reconsidered the reallocation of funds from environmental projects to better support the sustainable development of water policy. Regarding this proposed directive, it is worrying that the amendments considered by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection did not sufficiently take into account the importance of clean surface water for increasing natural areas with clean groundwater resources. In Finland, surface water is very clean. Artificial groundwater production is an environmentally friendly way of filtering clean surface water to replenish groundwater reserves. This process is carried out without the need for chemical treatment plants. The directive should not jeopardize this activity. In disagreement with the Council's common position, the Committee on the Environment also seeks to further limit the possibilities of water transfers. This would be problematic for countries with unevenly distributed water reserves. Ecologically sustainable transfers should not be restricted by EU regulations. Activities in this regard must continue to be controlled by regulations and have the appropriate authorization, but the same provisions do not apply, for example, to Finland and to a country suffering from droughts like Greece. Mr. President, Commissioner, water is an invaluable natural resource, indispensable for certain vital functions, and it is our duty to protect it. I believe that a framework directive on water policy in the European Union is essential, as the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources, and I congratulate the rapporteur for the effort made to resolve this thorny issue and reconcile all opinions. However, I must mention that there are differences on the water issue between northern and southern countries, so the same solution cannot be adopted. There are regions in Europe with a structural lack of water, and this directive must take this into account. In recent years, due to climate change, the countries of the Mediterranean basin have been facing serious problems due to flooding and drought. Mr. President, we agree with the common position; But we also accept many amendments that have been submitted that aim to improve it. But we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of calculating the cost of water because in my country, a large number of users are farmers. Furthermore, amendments that do not allow water to be transported from one river basin to another would condemn many regions in my country to water shortages. I believe that the issue of the elimination of hazardous substances must be approached on a realistic basis in order to achieve a resolution. Regarding the time required to implement the directive, it must be taken into account that there are countries where the infrastructure for implementing this directive requires significant time and resources. Mr. President, I believe that despite these observations, the common objective of the sustainable use of water resources remains.	es
European postal services The next item is the debate on oral question (B5-0010/2000) by Mr. Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the Commission, on European postal services. Mr. President, the postal sector is still a sector in which old, outdated monopolies are allowed to operate, without competition. This has been the case for too long, due to the absence of a vigorous Commission in this sector. In all other sectors, the Community competition authorities have intervened, but not here. We have waited in vain for Commission proposals for 18 months. I would like the Commission to answer me today: when will we have new, modern postal services that can operate throughout the EU? One of the most important Community principles is the internal market. We are working hard to expand it to include more Member States. This requires efficiency, and efficiency means competition. Today, there are demands for liberalization and deregulation in all sectors. The EU is often at the forefront of this process. The Commission is driving this development in an exemplary manner. The Commission does so because we have many experiences with old monopolies incapable of providing good service, as a modern society demands. It also does so to keep up with technological development. Furthermore, the Commission does so to be able to lower prices, convinced that this is easier to achieve in a free market subject to the rules of competition. This is the case in a number of sectors; unfortunately, so far, with the major exception of postal services. I don't think it's precisely because customers are satisfied. We all know that criticism of price increases and delays in letter delivery are a constant topic of discussion. If we are truly interested in having a functioning internal market, we cannot continue to make exceptions for the activities of postal services. Some countries have advanced more quickly and created the conditions for freer competition in the postal sector. The Netherlands, Finland, and Sweden have gone the furthest. These countries have demonstrated over the past decade that some benefits can be achieved. In Sweden, moreover, this development has been taking place gradually, in an environment of broad political consensus. It is important that this process be allowed to continue and that it be given the necessary incentives. Experience shows that old monopolies are not capable of providing services that function as all of us, the customers, have the right to demand. Given the approach of this debate, those in favor of continuing the monopoly have sent a letter. In it, they refer to Sweden as a warning. Such criticisms could possibly be made in a number of situations, but not specifically in this area. A circular letter stated that the price of stamps has risen 59 percent since liberalization in 1993. This is true, if we consider this only on the condition that only 20 percent of the total postal market was taken into account, where, in practice, a monopoly still exists, that is, where the state is the sole player.	es
One point concerning the impact on businesses is of particular importance, as Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi have pointed out: SMEs. Many Members have insisted on this aspect. The Commission is pursuing the issue of legal certainty for SMEs with particular attention. The system we are proposing significantly improves legal certainty for SMEs. Why? Is it just a political move? No, in the context of the system we are proposing to reform the material rules in such a way that the majority of SMEs will be covered by the block exemption regulations, as is the case with vertical constraints; the majority of SMEs, in fact, have less than 30% of market shares. We have considered a de minimis notification which contains a statement that SMEs are, as a rule, not subject to the strict prohibition of Article 81(1), as there is no problem of a dominant market position for such companies. We are continuing to work on other block exemption regulations and guidelines that will take into account the specific situation of SMEs in a comprehensive manner, firstly by eliminating the bureaucratic effects of the current notification system and, secondly, by making Article 81(3) immediately applicable, to the particular advantage of SMEs. The fourth issue is that of legal certainty. Of course, legal certainty, Mr Evans - I am the first to recognise this - is important for businesses, not only for the legal professions, which also play a very important role in the construction of Europe. Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a topic on which the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, who I am very grateful to, also stressed in her latest speech for her constant focus on the issues of the single market in the broad sense, including competition in this case. I am convinced that this proposal will increase the legal certainty of businesses, for three reasons: it will allow all restrictive agreements which satisfy the conditions for exemption to be authorised without a prior decision, by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3); it will create the possibility of assisting businesses in cases of interpretative doubt by publishing reasoned opinions; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines to clarify the rules and ensure their certainty. (FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the legal privilege for in-house lawyers. Let me point out that the Court of Justice ruled on this issue, as you know better than I do, in 1982. That case law remains valid and there is nothing to justify calling it into question. The White Paper requires a re-examination of the issue in one aspect only: the exchange of confidential information. The guarantees which must be given to businesses are currently being discussed. I now come quickly, Mr President, to the report by Mr Rapkay, to whom I extend my heartfelt thanks for the quality of his work and for the substantial support given to the Commission's 28th annual report on competition policy.	it
"Secondly, we must maintain the data as established in the common position. Thus, from 2006, free return of all vehicles will be granted, with no costs for the final owner. This, of course, is an extremely essential point, which cannot be amended. Is this too much of a burden? There is one thing we must not forget. The directive deals with whole vehicles, that is, vehicles that do not lack any essential parts. In the opinion of specialists, there are few whole cars that have no value. Because recycling, the reuse of components, is a sector that does not necessarily have to generate losses; on the contrary, there are currently a large number of companies that make a living from it and earn a decent living. The directive stimulates this entire sector, which is a sector of small and medium-sized enterprises. Since transport costs in this case are high, it will be necessary to implement a completely decentralized system, because transporting scrap metal more than 100 kilometers is not a profitable activity. I think it's positive that the directive does not apply to historic vehicles, and I think we should add this. Therefore, vintage vehicles, ""oldtimers,"" in my view, should be exempt. It's also good that we clearly attribute responsibility to the manufacturers. This is a basic principle that we must uphold. They are responsible for the design phase. Consequently, they can do a lot for the environment through that design phase. We must also continue to support the manufacturers bearing all or a large part of the costs, as set out in the common position. I think it's a balanced formula and does not exclude a number of other aspects. I think we should maintain it. Therefore, our group will stick as closely as possible to the common position and will not modify it in its essential aspects. Because, of course, we all know that this common position was reached in the Council with great difficulty, that a very difficult balancing act was undertaken to achieve it. For our part, I believe we cannot jeopardize this common position, because it is a directive we absolutely need for environmental reasons. I ask you to support this common position. Our group, in any case, will do everything possible to achieve this, for environmental reasons, and because we have this directive, and because it is a balanced directive that contains a large number of elements, a large number of objections, for example, the sharing of costs. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, today we must make a very important decision. If the European Parliament supports the ecological principle of manufacturer responsibility, this will mean that vehicle manufacturers will also be responsible for end-of-life vehicles. No, say the Christian Democrats in Amendment 38: vehicle manufacturers and motorists must share the costs equally. With the Packaging Directive, where this compromise on sharing was reached, it became clear that the solution did not work."	es
And therein lies the paradox. The convergence of political and monetary Europe inevitably leads to the convergence of the rules of the game for labor markets and social protection. At the same time, however, the single currency, combined with the absence of job mobility and a redistributive tax policy, forces us into a non-convergence of wages and social protection to compensate for productivity differences between countries and regions. Hypocrisy and fine words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernization, and consultation will not free us from these contradictions. Either the European Union becomes a genuine federal state, with genuine redistributive taxation, genuine job mobility, and therefore, and only from then on, with common rules on employment and social protection, or it is better not to make empty promises and entertain illusions about the impossible paths to convergence, a principle that sounds good, but which causes harm, especially to the most disadvantaged. We would all do well to be aware of this. Mr President, unlike some of my colleagues who spoke in today's debate, I tend to approve of the Andersson report, among other things because I see very clear differences from the Commission's communications. In particular, I believe that this report defends the solidarity-based approach of the European social model - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this. I would like to highlight the clear positions against social dumping, as well as on the right to minimum social protection, the objective of social convergence and, more specifically, what is very specifically mentioned in terms of equal opportunities and social policy objectives. I also note the shortcomings with regard to the insufficiently coherent consideration of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, a policy that hinders this solidarity-based modernisation of the European social model. Overall, however, I consider this report to be positive. Mr President, I rise to speak, and reiterate, about the need to modernize social protection more as an instrument than as a further step towards European integration. This is what Mr Andersson's report, which I believe to be excellent, emphasizes. Europe, the European Union, although very strong in the economic and political spheres, will become lame, weak and limited, perhaps short-lived, if we fail to make it strong in the social sphere. I believe that this last point implies employment opportunities for those who ask for them and firm action in favor of the socially weaker. Considering that everyone has the right to social protection and a guaranteed minimum social income, I believe that we must not forget the case of those who were not born within the European Union. Do not forget that in 1999, 717,000 people came to compensate for our low birth rate. This is why, in the social order, an immigration policy with a social conscience is absolutely necessary, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain.	fr
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that there are still large economic sectors that are still very much in the public domain, ranging from public television, which is compulsorily funded by taxpayers, or postal services, to certain compulsory insurances, including health and social insurance, which are managed by inefficient public monopolies that offer no salvation to members except the well-off. Commissioner, I am fully aware of the constraints of the Treaties, but I believe it is important to reiterate here that the European economy is suffering from American competition, also and above all because of the lack of openness and competition. What we are doing now is probably very important, but it is still not enough. Mr President, by definition, a White Paper is not a take-it-or-leave-it situation, but is intended to provoke reactions. From this point of view, the White Paper is a success. It represents a good basis for discussion and should therefore be well received. I understand the authors' views at the beginning of their study and I agree with them. I also assume that you, Commissioner, want to live up to your reputation and the work of your predecessors, and that your departments also share the same objective. I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives that would result in a departure from European integration and renationalisation. However, I am concerned and I have questions. I am first of all concerned about the consistent application of the policy. I am generally a strong supporter of cultural diversity, but not when it comes to the culture of competition in the internal market. The internal market needs a competition policy that is uniform, not only in its concept, but also in its implementation. European regulations are certainly issued and communications on their interpretation are indeed sent out. The Commission should also have the right to evocation and should issue guidelines to the national competition authorities. I wonder, however, whether we are not running the risk of finding ourselves in a procession to Echternach, where every two steps forward is a step backward. I would therefore like to know a little more about how the Commission intends to ensure in practice the uniform application of the proposed policy and whether you consider that the avenues described from point 100 of the White Paper onwards can be followed realistically. Secondly, I understand the concerns of businesses about legal certainty. Many cases are being submitted precisely with this in mind. However, this instrument will disappear in the future. You say in the White Paper that the Commission will issue some individual provisions that could serve as guidelines, but what will be your criteria for sometimes granting and sometimes refusing such specific arrangements? Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has considered what the consequences of its new approach would be for business strategy. I am particularly concerned about the fate of small and medium-sized enterprises, which will lose some of the legal and economic protection they have, as is the case with the new block exemption in the distribution sector.	fr
But, despite all these virtues, the LIFE III regulation fails, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, in what is evidently most important for the impact of a financial instrument: its budget. The Commission and the Council, by persisting with their proposal of €613 million as the reference amount for the period 2000-2004 and by disallowing the European Parliament's proposal of €850 million, are taking a decision that, in our view, is not based on the same criteria of rationality and justice that they rightly introduced into other provisions of LIFE III. For our part, the Commission and the Council should know that we are not renouncing to provide LIFE with the budget it deserves and that would better guarantee the environmental results sought to be achieved with an instrument of this type. We justify this choice with four very simple arguments. First, LIFE is the only direct financial instrument intended to promote environmental policy in the European Union. There is no other. Secondly, LIFE is an instrument that has yielded good results, has enabled the development of innovative methods and techniques, and has an excellent implementation rate. Thirdly, LIFE's budget has decreased in real terms and has not kept up with the enormous dynamic and creative demand. Fourthly, Parliament, given the credit it attributes to LIFE, has included ever-increasing allocations for this program in its annual budget, so the approval of the proposal championed by the Council and the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of that trend. But our concern is not only budgetary. The amendments on climate and water policy concern matters of great concern to European citizens and have merited considerable attention from this House. Therefore, for us, the approval of our Amendments Nos. 5 and 6, aimed at designating the sustainable management of groundwater and surface water, as well as the reduction of greenhouse gases, as objectives to be achieved with LIFE Environment, is crucial. A few final words to congratulate Mrs. Lienemann on her report and take this opportunity to tell her that we will vote in favor of her amendments on comitology, given that—although we prefer, as was made clear in the Environment Committee, that LIFE be monitored by an advisory committee—we do not wish to contribute to the implementation of the solution proposed by the Council, which is frankly worse. Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate Mrs. Lienemann on her report, and also the Commission—why not?—because this report, this position, generally improves on the current texts. Furthermore, it has a more acceptable system and is clearer and more transparent. I would also like to congratulate the Commission services, since the evaluation, control, and monitoring of the LIFE programme reasonably guarantee the selection and implementation of projects.	es
"Honourable Member, the answer I gave you was the only one possible. However, I would like to clarify the following: the interpretation given to Article 255 of the Treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity. There is currently no concrete proposal that would allow us to work on the regulation of this Article, and in the absence of such a proposal it is not possible to proceed in this matter. In any case, at first reading, it can be said that Article 255 does not allow us to work on a basis that could undermine the principle of subsidiarity. I am essentially interested in understanding how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam, aimed at ensuring that citizens have greater opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. How will this be achieved, given that at the same time in the Commission proposal - it has been leaked, so it is known to the public - it is said that the freedom of thought of officials has priority over openness, that it is not possible to have access to working documents, reports, drafts, etc.? Doesn't the Council representative think that this makes participation in the democratic decision-making process difficult? Honourable Member, the issue you raise is of the utmost importance and we discussed it at length during the last Intergovernmental Conference. I would like to say one thing to you: transparency is not only needed in the relations of the Community institutions ""to the outside"", but also ""between"" the Community institutions. That is to say, there are elements relating to the form and the process of functioning of the Community institutions that are not accessible to other institutions, and this is not only a question of the Commission's relationship with Parliament, but also with the Council. This issue has been addressed and discussed several times in its time. The European Parliament will have the opportunity to be part of the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference. The issue is still open. The presentation and real transparency of the functioning of the institutions at European level is a matter of the utmost importance which, in my opinion, needs to be analysed elsewhere, in particular in the context of the next Intergovernmental Conference. We have no doubt about this and we believe that the parliamentarians who will be part of this preparatory group will have the opportunity to raise the issue again. I believe that the proposal put forward by the Commission should contain elements that allow for greater transparency in relation to the functioning of the various institutions, but I think that there is always room for improvement in this area. For our part, we are prepared to analyse the proposals that emerge in this area. The question posed by Mr Sjöstedt and others is very important. In Sweden, there is a principle of publicity of documents that strengthens democracy and ensures good dialogue between citizens, authorities and decision-makers. We are very keen that the Union can also move in the same direction, as specified in the Treaty of Amsterdam. A year or two ago, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Lööw that is very important in this context. The report warned against the risk that this impending process could lead to limitations in the level of publicity of documents existing in the various countries."	it
Your votes, ladies and gentlemen, in favor of my entire report, as supported by the Committee on Fisheries, will form a very important part of a broader ISA control package, based on the reality of the Scottish situation and the lessons learned from the success of others. I congratulate Mr. Hudghton and fully support his report and would urge your honorable Members to do the same. As he said, fish farming is an essential source of employment in some peripheral parts of rural Scotland, and at a time when rural Scotland is suffering the worst recession in the last 100 years, aquaculture provides an essential boost to the rural economy, on which many thousands of jobs depend directly and indirectly. Currently, as he said, more than 85,000 tonnes of salmon are now produced in Scottish fish farms, an industry that generates more than €800 million. Unfortunately, although ISA was first detected in Scotland two years ago, it has now spread directly to 29 fish farms, and around 240 others are affected in one way or another. Wild salmon, trout, and eels have been identified as carriers of the virus, which now appears to be endemic in the wider marine environment. But I must say that, despite the Greens' alarmism, it must be emphasized that ISA is not, under any circumstances, transmitted to humans. I must echo Mr. Hudghton's point that the virus cannot survive above 25°C—that is, human temperature—it is a cold-water virus. However, in infected fish, it can cause considerable weight loss and premature death in its advanced stages, and as such, it has had a serious impact on the entire Scottish aquaculture sector, costing the industry around 60 to 70 million in losses resulting from premature compulsory culling and other eradication measures. So, Mr. President, this report provides a stimulating range of proposals to improve the way in which authorities in the United Kingdom and elsewhere should respond to this disease. By recommending the introduction of a progressive containment and culling method, similar to the system used successfully in Norway, the rapporteur is seeking a more flexible approach to the disease that will generate greater confidence, not only in the insurance industry, which to date has clearly refused to provide any form of cover due to the insistence on a compulsory culling policy. By recommending the development of research and the eventual use of vaccines to control and eradicate ISA, the rapporteur also comforts the pharmaceutical industry, which until now has had no incentive to invest in vaccine development. I therefore fully recommend this excellent report and trust that Parliament will give it its support. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Hudghton, for this report. Scottish salmon farming is the largest in the European Union and accounts for 90% of the British aquaculture industry. The industry is located in some of the most remote communities in Europe and provides a livelihood for those communities.	es
Firstly, every European port must set up proper port reception facilities for ship-generated waste, if it doesn't already have them. They must therefore be there. Secondly, all ships, regardless of their flag, must dispose of their waste. Thirdly, the costs must be borne by the ship. We agree on this. We want to achieve a system together to avoid economic incentives to dump waste into the sea. Firstly, we want to protect flora and fauna, and secondly, there are many coasts that, on the one hand, are meant to be enjoyed by tourists and, on the other, jobs. That means we want to have an effective system. How do we differ from the Council, apart from minor details such as wanting to exempt museum ships from bureaucratic regulations and being a bit stricter with large fishing vessels and pleasure craft? The truly crucial difference is how the disposal costs are passed on to the ship. Mr. Bouwman has already explained this. There are two experiences: one in the Baltic Sea region, and this is not a single country's experience, but the experience of the entire Baltic Sea region, and it shows that if a large portion of the disposal costs are covered by general port fees, then there is no incentive to dump ship-generated waste in the sea. If you've already paid for the disposal, then you can just as easily dispose of it in the port. The other system is the pure polluter pays principle: anyone who lands ship-generated waste has to pay extra for it. This second system has proven ineffective. Why is the Mediterranean so dirty? Why is the North Sea so dirty? Because the polluter pays principle doesn't work due to a lack of proper controls! That is why the committee, by a broad majority—not a large majority; the representatives of the minority opinion will speak shortly—said, as did Parliament as a whole at first reading, without any dispute, that the no-special-fee system is the better system because it offers ships an economic incentive, so to speak, not to dump their waste at sea, but to dispose of it in sensible port reception facilities. That is the crucial issue. We are prepared to reach an agreement with the Council. But the Council has so far rejected any serious agreement with us. I therefore appeal to the House to support our proposal that substantial parts of the costs, up to 90%, must be covered by general port dues. Because then we have the opportunity to reach an agreement with the Council in the conciliation procedure, be it at 75% or whatever. That is why I also ask the Commission: Madam Vice-President, be careful which side you take! I believe that in the interests of environmental protection and a long-term, flourishing tourism industry in many countries within our Community, it is better to have an effective system. Therefore, please support our no-special-fee system. Perhaps we can then reach a reasonable compromise with the Council in the conciliation procedure. Mr President, I am pleased that you are chairing this debate, knowing that, as a Bavarian, you always listen to ports and the seas. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Theo Bouwman, for his work and for his cooperation with us in the run-up to tomorrow's vote.	de
How do you describe it? What is a recognized minority? Regarding the political decision, I would also like to ask who makes the political decision. Is it the Commission? Is it the Council? To what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this process? What is the role of the scientific committees? And what will be the upcoming role of the food authorities that you are going to set up? Finally, will this decision-making be done in a transparent and public manner? These are my three questions. Yes, Mr. President, that is correct. There were many complex topics and they were not always absolutely clear, but I will try to answer some questions. Who will make the decision? Who are the political decision-makers? Well, that depends on the legislators. This is part of risk management. They must take into account, for example, citizens' concerns about a particular topic, and they must form an opinion based on the scientific evidence in a given case. But it is true that the use of the precautionary principle does not depend on the vast majority of the scientific community. It can be used on the basis of evidence from a minority or when the science is not complete. Of course, this is where a balance is struck between this principle as a political instrument and science. It is not always easy to describe precisely how this process unfolds, but there is no question of changing the scientific basis. We consult with experts to gather as much information and facts as possible before making a decision, and this is what we will have to do in the future as well. You must consider this as a tool of risk management. You have to choose: either you put citizens at risk, for example, or you want to protect the environment, and you must take into account the available science. You have to evaluate all of this and evaluate the science. Then you decide whether or not to take a measure, whether or not to undertake an action. So, there are no answers to all your questions, but this does not change either the system of scientists or the system of experts that we use today. Mr. President, I have a question regarding a specific, current case in which the precautionary principle could apply. It concerns bromine flame retardants. It is a fact that these substances are now being detected; increasing concentrations are being discovered in humans and in the environment. Many people claim that they pose significant risks, while others question the significance of the risks associated with these substances. Recently, Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission, via the Council of Ministers, to take an initiative to ban bromine flame retardants. I am therefore wondering whether you are preparing such a ban and whether taking such an initiative would not, in your view, be very consistent with the precautionary principle itself.	fr
"This is true in the area of globalization. Globalization enables greater wealth creation, an increase in international trade, and productivity. But deregulated globalization, as it exists today, or globalization in which broad sections of the world's population do not benefit from extensive investment in people, is also a factor of exclusion, division, and the widening of the gap between rich and poor. This is true in the knowledge society, which can pave the way for a new level of equality of opportunity, but can also foster an ever sharper divide between those who have access to it and those who are denied it, as is the case with the relations between the old and the new economy. Moreover, this is not the first time that a technological transition has taken place that alters the paradigm of society and economic organization. In such profound transition phases, it has always been the case that the problems, especially the employment problems of the old economy, are solved by harnessing the new economy and its tools. Let me give you an example: In Europe, we have a textile industry. We must continue to have a textile industry in Europe in the future, but this will only be the case if we can apply the technologies of the information and knowledge society there. It is truly remarkable that there is currently a shortage of 800,000 skilled workers for existing jobs in the so-called ""new economy"" sectors, while at the same time there are millions of unemployed. This means that we have not yet been able to harness the tools of the new economy to solve the problems of the old economy, which will never be resolved within the framework of that old economy. Finally, I would like to answer a question I have been asked: whether I am speaking on behalf of fifteen or fourteen countries. The answer is simple: I am speaking on behalf of fifteen countries. Austria's full participation in the work of ALL Union institutions is part of what the Portuguese Presidency has guaranteed. This does not prevent the Portuguese government – and certainly many other European governments – from not fighting against a single country, but from defending principles and values. Principles and values, moreover, that existed before political movements such as the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats. I am talking about the principles and values of the Enlightenment era, which include the affirmation of the primacy of reason. If modern societies today have an enemy, it is irrational political behavior. One can call this irrationality political populism, or excessive nationalism, religious fundamentalism, racism, or xenophobia. This raises a central question: without the affirmation of these values, there can be an economy and employment, but no Europe. , Commission. (IT) Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, allow me to conclude this long but extremely constructive and important debate with a few very brief remarks. Firstly, we are not starting from scratch. All those who may have considered our statements overly optimistic must understand that we are not starting from scratch. Europe can rely on the advantages of the common currency and the advantages of the internal market."	de
"And more than that, and this is rather prosaic, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by translating them into new programs that are comprehensive and overarching, benefiting our creative industries to the extent that they now need. It demonstrates flexibility and opens up access to culture for the socially disadvantaged and excluded. What I regret, of course, is the fact that, in implementing this program, we do not have the resources at our disposal that our ambitions demand and that would be necessary for its implementation. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of a long road. After the conciliation phase, our institutions can now formally adopt the new framework program, ""Culture 2000."" This provides us with a perfectly suitable instrument and clearly structured measures with which, I am sure, we will successfully develop the field of culture over the next five years. I am pleased with this happy ending, and I would like to thank you for it. I would like to thank all the Members of Parliament who contributed to bringing this conciliation procedure to a successful conclusion. In particular, I would like to thank the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and especially the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, and its chairman, Mr Gargani; as well as the European Parliament delegation, the political group leaders, and the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr Imbeni. Everyone made constructive, balanced, and decisive contributions, which proved to be of great help throughout the entire procedure. I would also like to add that the difficult, at times very tiring, negotiations were concluded in record time. We now have a framework programme, the first of its kind in the field of culture. This programme gives us the opportunity to take new approaches and promote culture in a more global, but also more comprehensive, and stronger way. Like you, I am pleased with these positive results, which, despite a budget that falls short of the objectives set, will enable us to look to the future with confidence. I would like to echo what the Chairman, Mr Gargani, just said: the Commission has made a statement in connection with the mid-term review. It has stated that it will carry out an assessment of the programme's results in the report to be presented pursuant to Article 7 of the decision of Parliament and the Council. This will include a review of the financial resources within the Community's financial perspectives; if necessary, the report will contain a proposal to amend the decision—and all this by 30 June 2002. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a formal commitment, not just a paper one. All this must lead us to strengthen our actions for a Community cultural area within which our cultures, with their specific characteristics and differences, can flourish more fully but also enrich each other—and other European citizens can fully participate in this. Thanks to Parliament's influence, more small-scale projects in the immediate vicinity of citizens are planned than large, spectacular initiatives. This has the effect of making the ""Culture 2000"" program a citizens' program."	de
Clearly, here we enter a territory, a murky area, in which Your Honor will tell me that these are civilian targets, such as bridges, railway or road infrastructure, while others will say that they are military targets, because they serve as support for military structures for aggressive actions such as those carried out at the time by Mr. Milosevic's forces in Kosovo. This difference in interpretation of some targets is what separates us. Regrettably, during the military actions in Kosovo, there were also, as everyone recognized, civilian sectors, particularly related to infrastructure that directly affected populations, and even populated areas, that were hit by NATO air actions. This is recognized, this happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war was not a clean war, it was not an exemplary war: it was the possible war. Only, it was the necessary war, as well as the possible one, to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable aggression and completely repudiated by the entire international community. Regardless of the interpretation we may make after the fact—it is easy to make interpretations after the fact if no action is taken—I believe, Honourable Member, that if we examine what happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the impunity caused by the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its continuation, we may perhaps be able to make a slightly less catastrophic interpretation of NATO's military action in Kosovo. Question No. 4 by (H-0028/00): Subject: Turkish blockade against Armenia. Bearing in mind that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic, and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999, what measures does the Council intend to take to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade against Armenia? Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade against Armenia? Mr. President, I would like to thank the representative of the Presidency of the Council for his reply. Nevertheless, I am somewhat saddened because it is initially viewed bilaterally, although ultimately there is a very clear triangular relationship. We provide cooperation loans and have a cooperation agreement to help Armenia, yet the aid cannot be effective because Turkey implements an economic blockade, preventing many projects intended for Armenians from moving forward. Negotiations are underway with Turkey regarding possible accession, and it is in all of our interests that any state wishing to become a member maintain friendly relations with its neighbors, including on its borders. Can't you exert more influence on Turkey to make peaceful developments possible and so that Armenians can also experience the development necessary for continued cooperation? The Honorable Member is absolutely right to say that we must leverage our relationship with Turkey precisely so that this country can play a constructive role in this situation and, in particular, become part of the solution rather than part of the problem.	es
Many protest voters, who have long desired a change in Austrian policy, have surely also mobilized. I believe that Parliament must support these democratic forces. I also call on the Austrian President to further examine all possibilities for forming a government composed of democratic forces. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to emphasize the value of an attitude such as the one that the chairman of our group, Mr. Francis Wurtz, recently recalled. I appreciate the statements made by the Council Presidency and the position of the fourteen countries that have refused to establish official contacts with the Austrian government if Jörg Haider's party participates. It is all the more important to emphasize this since, as everyone knows, we substantially disapprove of the political lines defined by this Europe, such as economic and social policies, the lack of democracy, and the involvement of these same countries in the dramatic Balkan war. This dissent highlights our approval today even more: an exceptional element, because the danger of a revival in Europe of an irrational and neo-Nazi component is also exceptional. This danger does not only concern Austria, but Europe as well. We are talking about ourselves, not Austria. We are aware of the social causes that contribute, along with unemployment and uncertainty, to fueling such propensities. We know the cultural reasons—xenophobic, racist—but we cannot ignore the inability and refusal of these extreme right-wing forces to cut ties with Nazism and the possibility of creating an explosive mixture in Europe. Let us talk about the Alpine arc, let us talk about all our countries: conditions allowing a resurgence of a danger to democracy and European civilization are currently being established. In its position, the Presidency has shown itself aware of this civilizational tragedy. Europe is proving that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe has a soul. Today, however, it should be consistent in its actions, and the Commission should be the first to do so. Unfortunately, it has demonstrated here an opacity and fragility that further affirms the value of the Presidency's position. This is the correction that must be made to the Commission's action. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the face of the fundamental democratic principle of respect for human rights and freedom and the sovereignty of peoples against all forms, new or old, of fascism, Nazism or communism, and given that all previous speakers have spoken of the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we see today this sovereignty denied by the European Parliament itself. A reading of the Austrian Liberal Democratic Party's programme does not reveal anything that could justify accusations of undermining the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties. On the contrary, I would like to remind colleagues that the current President, who is so critical of Austria, recently placed the people of Macao under the sovereignty of the democratic People's Republic of China.	fr
"What more will the Union attempt in this regard if the opposition's demand—early elections—is accepted? What more can we do and attempt to support the opposition? Mr. President, Commissioner, we trust that Kosovo was the last case in which international law could be interpreted to mean that dictators can persecute minorities in the cruelest way, hiding behind the excuse that ""it takes place within the borders of their own country."" When the US, NATO, and finally the EU reacted, it was too late. Much suffering could have been avoided if, among others, the US had reacted earlier and more clearly. That is why we, the European Union, have a special responsibility to rescue, assist, and build the Balkans. Our goal must be to create the necessary conditions for all the countries of southeastern Europe to integrate economically, commercially, and politically into the EU. The best way to lay the foundations for democracy in this war-torn part of Europe is through trade and economic integration. We liberals are prepared to go far and do so quickly, as Paolo Costa has pointed out. That is why we welcome with great satisfaction this proposal for a Stabilization and Association Agreement with Macedonia and thank Swoboda for this excellent report. Macedonia deserves our help, considering the sacrificial and selfless work its people and leaders carried out during the Kosovo war. Now that Macedonia is freeing itself from the clutches of communism and nationalism, it is our obligation to react very clearly and offer our support. We must act in the same way in the other Balkan countries. It is an obligation for the EU. Mr. President, in this context, let me remind Members—with particular regard for this afternoon's debate—that the man who bears the primary responsibility for the war, the outrages, the murders, and the expulsion of innocent people from their homes still governs Serbia, the rest of Yugoslavia. The man who is accused of genocide and who should be tried at The Hague Tribunal, is still at large. I am speaking of Milosevic. As long as Milosevic continues to govern Serbia and Serbia does not choose a democratic path, that country will remain a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkan region and, also, in Macedonia. Mr. President, the agreement being pushed through will constitute the first application of the Stability Pact in Southeastern Europe. Undoubtedly, its terms, accepted by the Swoboda report, do not seek peace, but rather greater political and economic subordination of the country, control of its natural resources, overexploitation of its workforce, and an even greater use of the country as a base of attack against the countries and peoples of the region that resist the new order. And all this in exchange for the promise of future membership in the European Union. The report accepts both this orientation and, more generally, the entire European Union policy towards Southeastern Europe."	es
Sanctions can be imposed after the violation of Treaties and not if a democratically elected party goes to government. Otherwise, how will we deal with the communist countries, which reaffirm themselves as communist: will we also throw them out of the Union if they go to government, or will everything be absolved for Stalin's grandchildren? (Applause from the right-wing benches) It is with diplomacy, persuasion, culture, solidarity, and not with threats, that the institutions can gain respect and make principles respected, not with anti-constitutional ways. Bilateral relations involve the states, so the 14 have nothing to do with it. This is trampling on the European institutions to defend partisan political logic, with an incompetence worthy of parties that have just emerged from totalitarian systems and not representatives of democratic traditions. Many, too many things divide us from Haider - as we have written many times - including his claim to the very Italian Alto Adige. But we knew this: today we learn with anguish that other exponents of the Union seem to have renounced the democratic role of the Union itself. We are for legality and democracy expressed by the people, for respect for national sovereignty as long as it does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights. We believe in Europe, while others seem to have started the process of disintegration of the Union. These are the results of hasty enlargements, of a lack of clarity of roles and tasks. The Europe of the dancing market has been created, not that of principles, rights and politics. Here are the consequences! We can therefore only invite the Commission to continue in a moderating role and to give appreciation to those who work to ensure that the autonomy and sovereignty of the Austrian people continue, ensuring that this people remains free and in solidarity with other peoples. Madam President, today we meet under the banner of hypocrisy. The Council has shown total contempt for the Treaty and has resorted to a procedure that is completely at odds with Articles 6 and 7, which provide for the possibility of condemning a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation. There are currently no serious and persistent violations in Austria. There are risks, and we are fully aware of them, but there is no serious or persistent violation at all. If we were called upon to apply the principles contained in Articles 6 and 7, if we were to apply the Copenhagen criteria to our institutions, to the European Union, this hypothetical candidate could not become a member precisely because of the same criteria that we ask the countries of Eastern Europe to observe. If we were to talk about a serious and persistent violation, we could certainly talk about certain Member States, we could talk about Italy and France, respectively the first and third country to have been condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg Court. We could talk about Belgium, honourable Belgian colleagues, about the Dutroux case, about the dozens and dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by certain people in this country, whose investigations have been covered up, systematically covered up.	it
The new agreement contains a binding commitment by both sides to good governance, which is seen as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership and on which regular dialogue will take place in an area actively promoted by the Community. Second, a new procedure has been created to address violations of human rights, democratic principles, and the rule of law. Compared with the current approach, the new procedure places greater emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned, and the consultation process is more flexible, allowing for effective dialogue on measures to improve the situation. In particularly urgent cases involving a serious violation of one of these essential elements, immediate action will be taken, and the other party will be informed. Third, the EU and the ACP have agreed on a new, specific procedure for dealing with serious corruption cases. This is a true innovation, both in the context of the EU/ACP agreements and in international relations more generally. This procedure is applied not only in corruption cases involving EDF funds, but also, more broadly, in all countries receiving EU financial assistance and where corruption is a hindrance to development. The procedure is therefore not limited to EU activities. This is a crucial aspect, taking into account the soundness of public finances. By including such a provision in the Partnership Agreement, the EU and the ACP countries are jointly sending a clear and positive signal that will certainly be appreciated by European taxpayers and, hopefully, by European investors. Another new area in the ACP-EU Agreement is immigration. We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area. This new dimension of the Partnership Agreement reflects the guidelines the EU advocates under the Treaty of Amsterdam and the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere, Finland, in October 1999. The European Union is committed to developing and implementing an immigration and asylum policy based on the principle of partnership with the countries and regions of origin. The agreement concluded with the ACP states paves the way for new initiatives, particularly with regard to the rights of third-country nationals within the EU, as well as measures to facilitate integration. We have agreed on rules related to illegal immigration. The EU and ACP states will define the possibilities and instruments for returning illegal immigrants to the countries concerned, within a framework to be negotiated with each ACP state individually. This includes third-country nationals and stateless persons. These highly innovative approaches can improve governance. The agreement also creates a sound framework for stabilizing the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid. We have agreed to start negotiations on new trade agreements to liberalize trade between the parties and to develop rules to regulate trade-related issues. Regarding the timeframe for the trade negotiations, we have taken the wishes of the ACP states into account. Negotiations will begin no later than 2002. This two-year preparatory phase will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP states' capacity to conduct trade negotiations.	de
"Stenzel report (A5-0034/2000) Mr President, I should like to make a very brief explanation of vote on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party on the EQUAL report. We followed a voting procedure which corresponded exactly to the agreements previously made with the Socialist Group. However, the Socialist Group amended the report, making it less clear than it could have been. This led us to abstain from voting. We want the report on the EQUAL initiative to be adopted, not least because it is very important for refugees and the elderly, as well as for disabled people and women. It is a pity that, because of the procedure followed, the report has received very little attention in this plenary session. I am convinced that the nationality of the rapporteur has had an influence - an influence which is completely out of place in this House, since it is at odds with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values to which our Parliament so often refers. These are the considerations which led us to abstain from voting on the report. We want the EQUAL initiative to continue; we agree with the vast majority of it, but we deplore the procedure that has been followed and the shameful way in which it has been exploited by some groups in Parliament. Mr President, also as a representative of the Pensioners' Party in the European Parliament, I abstained on the vote on the EQUAL initiative because, although it introduced support for projects aimed at combating age discrimination to a greater extent than in the past, it was not incisive and concrete enough in this direction. I abstained for another reason too: I believe that the time has come for the institutions of the European Union to stop experimenting and seeking out good practices on what we should do and to start giving concrete indications to European citizens on what Europe wants Europe to be. We must take concrete measures and move from theory to practice. We voted in favour of the report on the Commission communication establishing the guidelines for Community Initiative Programmes (CIPs). We are fundamentally opposed to this type of structural programmes and funds, but since the vote is only about how - and not to what extent - these resources should be used, we have stuck to this. We believe that ensuring equal opportunities for the groups mentioned in the report is important. We did not vote against the report because we believe that it sets out some good general principles, such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce gender inequalities in the labour market. However, we did not vote for it either because these intentions remain very vague, if not downright wishful thinking. In the chapter on aid and training projects for refugees, the report takes a step back from the initial text, since it takes care to specify that it no longer concerns refugees as such, but ""only refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Convention"". Such a restriction is unacceptable at a time when many refugees throughout Europe are in a dramatic situation, without protection, forced to work clandestinely and go into hiding, while the governments and police forces of so-called democratic states hunt them down."	it
"It simply authorizes the Commission to do so if it wishes. As already mentioned, the proposal for a Council decision is divided into two parts. The first concerns the financing of Member States to implement Community programs. The second part is to authorize the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects. There are a few minor amendments: Amendment 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to Member States can cover not only the costs of data collection but also the costs of management, compilation, aggregation, etc. Amendments 3 and 6 aim to make the timetable more flexible, as Member States will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programs actually entail; they also aim to align the timetable with the dates and the regulation. Amendments 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is regularly transmitted to the budgetary authorities. More significantly, the Committee on Fisheries, in Amendment 1, accepts the recommendation of the Committee on Budgets that the funding should be entered under Item 1(b) rather than Item 3 of the financial perspective. Although in its preliminary draft budget, the Commission entered the appropriations under Item 3, ""Internal policies,"" Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion. This provides security, to ensure that the necessary resources continue to be available. Mr. President, I think we must all agree with Mrs. Attwooll's assertion at the beginning of her excellent report that these two Commission proposals, aimed at better understanding the scientific and socio-economic situation in the fisheries sector, come at a critical time. The proposed comprehensive data collection and its appropriate processing will be essential elements in approaching the review of the common fisheries policy with greater rigor. That is, of course, if the data are ultimately obtained. Because, as our rapporteur also rightly points out, the Commission's proposal is not binding on the Member States. Whether or not they submit data is entirely voluntary, and failure to submit it would only mean the loss of some economic compensation, which, incidentally, is not very high. Given our experience with submitting data in the fisheries sector – and I refer to the reports on the implementation of the MAGPs – I believe that instead of having a complete picture of the situation in this sector, we will end up with a confused panorama, in which some Member States will provide, for example, scientific data, but not data on employment, while others will provide data on employment, but not on the state of resources, depending on whether they can – or want to – obtain and submit it. And, of course, I fear that some will prefer to forgo funding if it allows them to continue to hide their mismanagement, something we have already seen in cases where the sending of said data was mandatory, as in the case of POPs."	fr
"Regarding the timetable and targets, the Council plans to achieve good groundwater status no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force; the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection wants this timeframe to be reduced to 10 years. The Committee also calls for an end to all discharges or losses of hazardous substances by 2020. The ultimate goal should be to achieve levels close to zero by 2020. The Council hopes to achieve good groundwater status within 16 years, but the Commission intends to halt the deterioration of the qualitative chemical status of groundwater to achieve good groundwater status within 10 years. All standards and targets relating to protected areas must be achieved within 10 years, not within 16 years. I must say that I am in favor of these timeframe reductions, all the more so since derogations are planned. Regarding costs, I approve the proposal that by 2010, Member States will have to ensure that water pricing policies encourage a more reasonable use of water resources. In the same vein, I hope that the European Commission will make a clear statement committing itself to submitting a proposal to ensure that water usage prices reflect environmental and resource costs by 2012. I will end by quoting one of the amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which requires no comment: ""Water is not a commercial good like any other, but a heritage that belongs to the peoples of the European Union and must be protected, defended, and treated as such."" I would like to officially record my concerns about the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote. We all agreed on the need to establish appropriate controls to protect our water supplies and also water users. Much of what the rapporteur says regarding the water problem is commendable. However, the issue of charges or taxes for water use is a matter that, under the rules of subsidiarity, is for the Member States to decide. In my opinion, it is inappropriate to use such a crude means as imposing a common European charge on this issue. In Ireland, all major water users, namely commerce, industry, and agriculture, already pay for water use. This is a decision for national and local government, and all future decisions must remain at that level. These are the main reasons for my vote. The European Union is currently in the process of adopting new water legislation in the European Union with a view to updating and establishing a long-term strategy for achieving a clean drinking water supply and the protection of existing water resources, including rivers and coastal waters. I support the objectives of this Community action in terms of water policy, but I do not support the proposal that domestic water users should be charged for the water they use."	es
It is true that its democratic life is still very imperfect, as demonstrated by the challenges and doubts regarding the results of the last presidential elections. But, in this tragic situation for its people, we cannot leave without an effective and adequate response the call of the leaders of the Mozambican government and opposition, who have known how to resist with a sense of responsibility the temptation to return to violence as a way of solving their problems. Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to add my voice to those of all those who have already spoken here, in drawing the attention of this Assembly—it is not necessary, but it must be done—to the brutal tragedy that is taking place in Mozambique. I have some figures here, and I believe they are the most up-to-date; there are already more than 300 dead, 650,000 displaced people, 2,400,000 isolated people, 85,000 people who need to be evacuated: some are up in trees, others on rooftops. As has been said, the most important thing is the helicopters. The most important thing is that this humanitarian aid not be delayed, because otherwise, in addition to the tragedy created by the floods, there will be a subsequent tragedy: the lack of assistance to the population, who will die of hunger, disease, and in the floods. And that is truly tragic and a burden on our conscience for all of us. The Commissioner recently said that he was indeed involved with Mozambique, as I am too, and therefore fully understands what is at stake, the entire tragic situation we are experiencing. I hope that the trip by Commissioner Nielsen and the Portuguese Secretary of State will inform us that this Parliament needs to know what is at stake, the extremely urgent needs that exist, so that we can help the people of that country, who so richly deserve it, in their struggle for development. Let me thank Commissioner Patten for coming to Parliament, despite having such short notice, in response to our wishes to debate this very serious matter. And, as has already been said, the images we have seen on television of the devastated Limpopo Valley are absolutely harrowing. There are children who have lost their parents and bereft, desperate, and helpless families who have lost absolutely everything. Although, as has already been said, this whole tragedy had been predicted and was foreseeable, and the slow and inadequate response—woefully slow and woefully inadequate—is something that should now compel us to invest seriously in disaster prevention measures. As the Commissioner said, this is yet another argument in favor of creating a rapid response unit for situations like this, tasked with dealing with crises like the one in that country, which has been exacerbated by the lack of strategies or logistical preparations in place.	es
As I have had the opportunity to say, the Commission is aware of its share of responsibility. In this context, it is putting the finishing touches to a first draft proposal for an evaluation panel, a scoreboard, so that all the institutions and other stakeholders can assess the progress made in implementing the necessary measures and in meeting the deadlines set by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Vienna Action Plan and the conclusions of the Tampere European Council. This evaluation panel will not be a simple legislative planning instrument, but also, and above all, an instrument for strengthening the transparency and accountability of all European institutions to citizens. Because it is for citizens that we are creating the area of freedom, security and justice. The progress made will not be due to the Commission, the Council, or even the European Parliament, but rather to the association of European institutions and the Member States themselves, since, as has been stated here, specific tasks of the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. In the coming weeks, I will be touring capitals to canvass the opinions of the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs. I intend to discuss this draft scoreboard with the European Parliament and civil society. We intend to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council, under the Portuguese Presidency, following the consultations I have just mentioned. My intention is to make this scoreboard an instrument of political and strategic guidance for all the institutions, but also an instrument of scrutiny by public opinion. I therefore recognise - and this is a challenge I believe we all face - the need to develop a communication strategy that will enable the general public to perceive the real added value of the Union in everyday life, in these very essential areas of citizenship, respect for the rule of law and, ultimately, democracy itself. Beyond the scoreboard, I would like to say that the Commission intends to present the following initiatives during the year 2000, and I would like to stress here that I welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency considers the development of this area as one of the priorities of its work programme. I hope that it will be possible, with the Portuguese Presidency, to work clearly in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, which is also the political message of Tampere, and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be followed by subsequent Presidencies. As regards immigration and the right to asylum, the Commission intends to present proposals for the preparation of a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees; to begin analysing the criteria and conditions for improving the implementation of the Dublin Convention and the possible amendment of its legal basis, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam; to continue the debate based on the communication already made on the rules leading to a common asylum process across the Union; and to present proposals for the development of legislation providing for the granting of residence permits for victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with the justice system against trafficking networks.	fr
Mr. President, I would like to say the following about the statements by the Council and the European Commission: I certainly recognize how sensitively you, Mr. President-in-Office of the Council, are approaching this issue and the efforts you are making to establish contact with the Turkish Cypriot side. Perhaps, however, it would be clearer and more accurate if the vocabulary you use left no doubt that you do not have indirect recognition—of any kind—in mind, even though you have emphasized that this is out of the question under any circumstances. I would not, for example, speak of the government in Nicosia. That is the Cypriot government, Mr. President-in-Office of the Council, not the government in Nicosia. This government has proposed a method by which the Turkish Cypriot side can be involved. The Council and the Commission should now urge the Turkish Cypriot side to become institutionally involved in the negotiations being undertaken by the Republic of Cyprus. On the other hand, the way the issue of the expiry of the protocols and the pre-accession strategy has been handled so far has raised some doubts in us. I cannot understand why an exception should be made for these two small countries, why this has led to conflicts between the institutions, or why Parliament had to exert pressure to transfer the funds to Chapter 7 for the pre-accession strategy. Is it really possible for the European Union to treat two small countries on the periphery of the Union in this way, countries that it needs, but which, on the other hand, also meet all the requirements to become full members of the EU and that could actually already join the Economic and Monetary Union? I agree with the Commissioner that this is a political decision, a political decision which should not be too difficult, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, given the enormous advantages, particularly the support it will provide for the two communities to once again form a single state, for a substantial rapprochement – there has indeed already been an initial rapprochement between the two communities – and for the definitive liberation of the Republic of Cyprus from the occupying forces. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, within the framework of the consultation procedure, we are today considering a proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of measures relating to the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta. This proposal is similar to that already put forward for other candidate countries and, once implemented, will replace the recently expired financial protocols. The pre-accession instruments are intended to provide a technical and financial contribution to the candidate countries' efforts to meet the requirements of the acquis communautaire. The Commission's review has shown that Cyprus and Malta, although classified by the World Bank as high-income countries, encounter the same difficulties in implementing Community law as the CEECs, due to their inadequate administrative and judicial capacity. During the committee's examination of Mr Brok's excellent report, it was pointed out that these two countries could also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal measures of regional interest. I would ask the Commissioner to expressly confirm this point.	de
Environmental institutions often lack the knowledge and methods to incorporate this perspective into their daily work. I would obviously like to know if the Commissioner is willing to integrate the perspective of equal opportunities for men and women into environmental policy and environmental programs. This is important. For all policies to acquire this perspective, I believe it is especially important for leaders in positions of responsibility to possess this basic knowledge. (SV) Obviously, my idea is that mainstreaming must be present in everything we do. In the plan being prepared in my Directorate-General, issues of equal opportunities for men and women play a very prominent role. I am also willing, for example, to personally organize seminars on leadership or other subjects to encourage women to take on new tasks within the Commission. To motivate them all, I believe it is very important to send this message from the top down, or from the bottom up, if you prefer. In general, my idea is that there is a female majority in environmental work. The goal is to establish this so that women can also access positions of responsibility or achieve higher positions in environmental work. I would like to state that our action plan reflects these ideas, but it can certainly be improved. I have some experience in drawing up and evaluating plans. I hope this will be of some help. Question No. 43 by (H-0045/00): Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company. The Boyne Estuary is listed as a Special Protection Area under the Wild Birds Directive and is awaiting designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. However, the Admiralty, Loughborough County Council, and Drogheda Local Council have authorized the development of a new harbor within the Special Protection Area and the drainage, at Stegrennan, of a mudflat that was recently added to the protection area at the express request of the Commission. Furthermore, a very large warehouse has been built there (with no easy access to the relevant planning permission documentation), and Drogheda City Council is planning other infrastructure projects. How can the Commission ensure that this type of development, funded by the Structural Funds, does not conflict with environmental conservation needs? Is the Commission prepared to suspend funding altogether until the development plans for the area are reviewed? The Commission is aware of the construction of the port, but it knows nothing about the warehouse or the other infrastructure projects mentioned by the Member. The construction of the port is funded by the Structural Funds and means, broadly speaking, that the Boyne estuary must be dredged and the resulting material temporarily stored on the Stegrennan coastal strip. The Boyne estuary is designated as a Special Protection Area under the Wild Birds Directive. This means that all works in the Boyne Estuary that may affect the Special Area of Conservation must comply with the conservation standards set out in the Natural Habitats Directive.	es
In particular, the Commission can accept in full amendments 6, 16, 21, 28, 31, 33, 34, 44, 45, 46, 48, 52, 53, 65, 67, 68, 75, 76, 78, 80, 84, 85, 88 and 102. The Commission can accept in part amendments 8, 18, 27, 29, 42, 43, 47, 54, 60, 62, 93, 94, 104 and 105. The Commission can accept in principle amendments 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 30, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 50, 55, 56, 57, 58, 63, 69, 73, 79, 86, 89, 96, 99, 106 and 108. However, the Commission cannot accept amendments 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 81(rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107. Thank you for your attention. (The President declared the common position approved as amended) Report (A5-0033/2000) by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection (COM(1999) 347) - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) President. This concludes the vote. EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000) I welcome the quality and ambition of this report on LIFE. I would briefly point out that LIFE is a financial instrument serving environmental policies within the European Union and in third countries, whether they are neighbouring Mediterranean countries, countries bordering the Baltic Sea or candidate countries. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposed numerous amendments, most of which were included in the common position adopted by the Council. For the third stage of LIFE (2000-2004), this instrument will be divided into three axes: LIFE-nature (47% of resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%). The most important amendments, in my view, concern: LIFE's contribution to sustainable development in the Community and to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment, particularly as regards the integration of the environment into other policies, and the implementation and updating of environmental legislation; improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of LIFE's implementation procedures, the procedures for information and dissemination to the public and the procedures for cooperation between beneficiaries; the objective of LIFE: this must primarily aim at sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere; the contribution of the projects supported to the sustainability of socio-economic activities, and consequently to job creation. What seems essential to me is that the LIFE instrument will remain open to the participation of candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe. Other candidate countries (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) will also be able to participate in LIFE when agreements allowing this participation are concluded with these countries.	fr
We submitted a communication on common asylum procedures and a recommendation for a decision authorizing the Commission to negotiate with Iceland and Norway an agreement to extend to these two countries the rules applied to EU Member States under the Dublin Convention. The Commission actively contributed to the work of the High-Level Group on Immigration and Asylum. Finally, in December, the Commission presented a proposal for the creation of the European Refugee Fund. In the area of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for regulations with a view to communitizing certain conventions: one on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I); another on jurisdiction, recognition, and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters (Brussels II); and yet another on the service of process and service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters. Also in 1999, we presented a communication on victims of crime in the Union, initiating a reflection born of Tampere and calling for the development of minimum standards on the protection of victims of crime, especially on their access to justice and their rights to compensation for the damage suffered, including legal costs. I would also mention the presentation of the draft decision on combating fraud and the falsification of non-cash means of payment. In the area of the Union's legislative framework, as regards the fight against financial crime, the Commission presented a draft revision of the Money Laundering Directive. In 1999, we saw the entry into force of Europol. Following what has been stated here by the Portuguese Presidency, with the new cycle in the areas of justice and home affairs, the beginning of the reflection on the implementation of the new powers granted to Europol by the Treaty of Amsterdam, we sincerely hope that it will be possible to discuss in the same way with the Commission the question of democratic control and the link between Europol and the relevant judicial authorities, in particular Eurojust. In 1999, the Commission presented its contribution to a European action plan to combat drugs, which forms the basis of the strategy adopted by the Helsinki European Council. This non-exhaustive list of actions allows me to reaffirm today before the Presidency of the Council and the Members, with great conviction, that if 1999 was the year of the consolidation of the Union's action in this fundamental area, it will also have been the beginning of a new phase of acceleration in the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice. The year 2000 will undoubtedly be the year of truth for the European institutions and the way in which they will be able to respond to citizens' demands for guarantees of freedom of movement, while respecting rights and ensuring security and stability, thanks to adequate judicial protection. This means that the year 2000 will be a year for the Council, Parliament and the Commission to test the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and contribute to the foundations of an enlarged political Union for the next decade.	fr
Packaging continues to be a huge problem in Europe and a burden on the environment. A section of the Socialists, led by Bernd Lange, argues that yes, the principle is good, but that we should not introduce it until 2010 or 2012, as reflected in Amendment 45. The common position sets the year 2006. This, in the opinion of the Green Group, is more than enough time for the automotive industry to prepare for the change. I therefore ask my colleagues not to support either Amendment 38 of the Christian Democrats or Amendment 45 of a group of Socialist MEPs. When vehicle manufacturers must bear the costs of recycling vehicles themselves, they will design them to make them easier and cheaper to reuse. For example, problematic plastics, PVC, will disappear from cars and be replaced by bio-based plastics made from plants. Ultimately, they will be cheaper, also for consumers. Twenty years ago, the majority in Parliament attempted to make the European environment more environmentally friendly. Today, this environmentalist position is under threat, under pressure, above all, from the French and German automotive industries. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, let us vote against Amendments 38 and 45. As the Green Group, we broadly support the common position. Mr. President, the remains of end-of-life vehicles constitute one of the major environmental problems, both in terms of the amount of landfill and scrap metal and the substances harmful to the environment. For this reason, the GUE/NGL Group advocates the implementation of regulations that are as comprehensive and consistent as possible. This directive allows us to move forward, but only on condition that Parliament does not destroy or weaken the Council's position. If adopted, many of the amendments tabled would considerably weaken this directive. I am referring specifically to the amendments from the PPE Group, but, unfortunately, also to some of Mr. Lange's amendments, in my opinion. It's not difficult to imagine that the automotive industry in some countries, for example the German one, has worked intensively, through lobbying, to promote the adoption of this directive. For us, it is crucial that the following points be considered: The polluter pays. This means that the manufacturer must assume responsibility, including in economic terms, for the recycling of vehicles. Rules must also be in place for existing vehicles. In this regard, we cannot accept any weakening of the Council's position on the date of entry into force. The recycling percentages and requirements in certain years must not be worsened. Furthermore, it is important to limit the use of hazardous elements such as lead. We will vote against all amendments that oppose this. It would be very negative, not only from an environmental perspective but also for the European Parliament's credibility on environmental issues, if the amendments that considerably weaken the directive were to be adopted.	es
This paper, in this short form, is a farce! A farce because we know and appreciate Commissioner Vitorino's work, and what is presented here in paper form is in blatant contradiction to what actually happens. A paper like this is no basis for a scoreboard at all. It was touted and celebrated as a great achievement, but I stand by the fact that we need a basis for a scoreboard. We as a Parliament want to seriously address future developments in this policy area on the basis of a program. What we expect are minimum standards for asylum procedures in order to achieve rapid assistance for refugees, but also to create clarity for those who are not fleeing. We want instruments to prevent abuse. We want the development of a common immigration policy that, of course, also takes into account the integration capacity of the Member States, and we need the expansion of Europol's operational tasks, for example, in order to take very concrete measures to combat organized crime. We are addressing these issues seriously and intensively, and we can expect the same from the Commission, even if it is only a matter of submitting papers! Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor to raise the issue of the World Trade Organization, an area on which there is convergence between the Commission's papers and the positions of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which, as has already been mentioned, is not the case in other sectors. There is convergence of views because we are in favor of global trade. We are in favor of this trade, but above all of the creation of common rules, common regulations, capable of regulating this global trade with a single objective: that this trade should serve development, and in particular harmonious development, in which the values of citizens do not belong solely to the most dynamic and competitive regions of the world. On the other hand, what do we conclude with this comment on principles? That these regulations and these standards at the level of the World Trade Organization have led to greater trade, that is, to greater wealth. But if we look at the indices of the distribution of this wealth, we unfortunately see that the gap between the richest blocs and countries in the world and the poorest and least developed countries continues to widen. It would therefore be legitimate and imperative for us to ask ourselves what use are the current common standards and the current common regulations? What is the value of the current negotiations, as they are being conducted, and the current functioning of the World Trade Organization if, on the one hand, they increase trade but, on the other, create dysfunction and, above all, continue to widen the gap between rich and poor countries? That is why we have said that we support the strategy set out here by the Commission for the negotiations in Seattle and for future talks. Above all, we support this strategic vision, but courage and boldness are required. On the one hand, we must insist on the inclusion of social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection in the forthcoming negotiations.	de
This should at least somewhat allay your concerns, Ms Peijs. As for Mr Evans's reference to the impact on business, a cost-benefit analysis should really be taken seriously. After all, the purpose of publishing the White Paper is to gather reactions from businesses and other sources. We have received a great deal of excellent advice and information, which provides us with sufficient material to carry out a cost-benefit assessment for business. Before we put forward a legislative proposal for a new regulation, we will examine all the material very carefully. As regards the impact on businesses, one issue that is particularly important, as raised by Ms Thyssen, Ms Peijs and Ms Palacio Vallelersundi, is that of SMEs. This has been underlined by many of the speakers before me. The legal certainty of SMEs is a matter of particular concern to the Commission. We are proposing a system that will considerably increase legal certainty for SMEs. Why? Is this simply a political gesture? No. We propose to reform the substantive rules so that most SMEs are covered by the block exemption, in a similar way to vertical restraints. Most SMEs already have a market share of less than 30%. We have a de minimis notice stating that SMEs are not normally covered by the strict prohibition under Article 81(1) because they do not hold a dominant position. We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines that take into account the special position of SMEs. Our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, firstly by removing the red tape resulting from the current notification system and secondly by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which should be particularly beneficial for SMEs. (IT) Fourthly, legal certainty: legal certainty, Mr Evans, is undoubtedly – and I am the first to acknowledge this – important for businesses, and not just for the legal professions, which nevertheless play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe. Legal certainty is important for businesses: the importance of this issue was also underlined by the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi – whom I should like to thank very much for dealing, as always, with internal market issues in a broad sense, in this case including competition – in her recent remarks. I am convinced that this proposal will mean greater legal certainty for businesses, for three reasons: because of the direct effect of Article 81(3), it will allow the authorisation, without prior decision, of all agreements restricting competition which meet the conditions for exemption. It will make it possible, in cases of doubt as to interpretation, to assist businesses by publishing reasoned opinions. At the same time, it establishes exceptions and guidelines to clarify the rules and ensure their certainty. (FR) Mrs. Thyssen also raised the issue of the legal exception for legal advisors. I would simply like to recall that, as you certainly know better than I, the Court of Justice ruled on this issue in 1982. This case law remains valid, and there is no reason to question it.	de
The free take-back system, for example, for old vehicles and the increase in the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs it generates. Therefore, for the consumer, for the environment, for the new jobs to be created in recycling, there is absolutely no need to amend the Council's common position, which is, in its current state, entirely acceptable. Mr President, like many others in this House, I believe that this is a good measure. It is a useful measure that we all need. Most of the technical issues have been resolved. Some details still need to be sorted out, but most of the technical issues have been resolved. We come to the final question. At the first reading, only the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs asked this question, and I was the only one, as rapporteur for the opinion of that committee, to ask Parliament the question, namely, simply, who pays? Thanks to the Council's common position, a reasonable compromise has been reached, in that manufacturers should pay a significant proportion of the costs and not all of them, as Mr. Bowis wrongly said. In fact—and this is what the lawyers tell us—they should not pay more than 20% or one-fifth of the costs, which is not unreasonable. For example, consider consumers in the United Kingdom who buy a Rover, as Mr. Lange indicated, or, for that matter, any other British make of car, and who, for years, have been paying an excessive price for these cars, higher than the price charged in other parts of Europe. Why should they pay? They have already paid. Why should taxpayers or future car buyers have to pay again to get rid of the vehicle from which the manufacturer has made a profit? I cannot accept that. Some amendments propose that. I cannot accept it, and I will vote against it. As far as these cars are concerned, the responsibility lies with the manufacturer. It is the manufacturer who must provide the infrastructure and bear a reasonable share of the disposal costs. The common position does not exclude the possibility of contributions from the government. The common position represents a reasonable compromise. Some of the amendments proposed today are completely unreasonable in that they relieve car manufacturers of the responsibility to pay even a small part of the cost of removing cars from the road. I cannot accept this, and on behalf of Europe's taxpayers and consumers, I am voting against these amendments. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone agrees that we must consider how to deal with end-of-life vehicles in Europe, but in this instance, the Council has not set an example of sound European environmental policy. The way in which the German Presidency of the Council handled this issue was reprehensible. First, Mr Trittin, the Environment Minister, did not hold sufficient consultations within his cabinet; Then Federal Chancellor Schröder interfered in the proceedings like a bull in a china shop, without knowing the case.	fr
"Funds must be allocated to category seven, where a review of the financial perspective must be carried out. This is the key point. The most important thing is that the pre-accession aid money for Cyprus and Malta be taken from category seven and a review of the financial perspective be carried out, because if the Council does not support it, it would actually be contradicting the decisions it adopted in Helsinki in December. Regarding the amount indicated in the Brok report, €130 million, I would also like to say on behalf of the Liberal Group that we must find an amount we can negotiate until we reach the sum. The most important thing is to ensure a multiannual program in the correct category, so that we can begin planning in Cyprus and Malta. Mr. President, the Greens/European Free Alliance Group supports the decision taken by the Helsinki European Council, according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot be a precondition for Cyprus' accession. Strong pressure must continue to be exerted on the Cypriot government, even though the will of the majority of the population cannot be subjected to blackmail, to blackmail by a section of it, also because we harbor serious doubts about the representativeness of the government in that part of the island. It is clear that the window of opportunity—the ""jacket of opportunity"" mentioned by the Presidency—must be fully exploited. However, we are convinced that, although Turkish-Greek relations have improved, this cannot be enough. The solution to the Cyprus conflict lies above all in improving relations between the two communities with a view to the establishment—hopefully not too far off—of a federation. In particular, we must act to resolve the issue of establishing genuine freedom of movement and the problem of the demilitarization and disarmament of the island. The European Union, beyond financial aid, which is undoubtedly important, must play an active role in guaranteeing and promoting contacts between the two communities by establishing discussion forums and confidence-building programs. I would like to express my deep regret at this time for the absence from Parliament of Alex Langer, a peacemaker and an example for all of us of how to build coexistence between peoples. Mr. President, the mention of the dialogue between the two Cypriot parties under the aegis of the United Nations reminds us that, twenty-six years after the Turkish army's invasion of the island, the occupation of almost 40% of the territory continues with 35,000 soldiers, heavy military assets, and the installation of more than 50,000 settlers, in complete violation of the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. What can the European Union do within this framework to promote—without interfering in matters that concern exclusively Cypriots—the search for a fair and viable solution to this dramatic problem affecting a country with ties to the European Community for almost thirty years and destined to join the Union in the coming years?"	es
And, if we're talking about serious and persistent violations, perhaps we can talk about certain Member States; we can talk about Italy and France, the first and third countries, respectively, condemned by the Council of Europe, by the Strasbourg Court. We can talk, ladies and gentlemen, about Belgium, about the Dutroux case, about the dozens and dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped, and murdered by figures from that country, and whose investigations are stalled, always stalled. We could, ladies and gentlemen, impose on the Council and the Commission, with a third of the MEPs, the obligation to question this matter. We could question the fact that the Austrians reject ten years, thirteen years, of party rule that has corrupted and rotted a country—Austria—just as it is corrupting and rotting countries like Italy, Belgium, and other Member States of the Union. We could indeed ask ourselves, ladies and gentlemen, why 76% of Belgian citizens have no confidence in their country's justice system, 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country's justice system, 53% of Italian citizens have no confidence in their justice system... (The President cuts the speaker off) Madam President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are deeply concerned about this debate. We cannot, and in no way do, support Mr. Haider's sentiments or politics, and we deplore the references he has made to the Third Reich. However, we also deplore the fact that your Parliament is considering interfering in the politics of an elected government of any country, especially one that is part of the European Union. My party in my country is not in the least racist, but we do not accept the dictates or interference of the European Union. Do you intend to interfere in the British Parliament if we are elected? Madam President, the people of Austria have spoken by electing Mr. Haider to their Parliament. I believe they gave him 28% of the vote, so a coalition government will be formed. Your Parliament, let me suggest, Madam President, should wait to see whether Mr. Haider's party has any impact on the politics of that country. Then, and only then, could you consider whether human rights are being affected. Your Parliament can consider appropriate measures to counteract that situation, and then, Madam President, and only then could your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a European Union country. Madam President, as a member of the Liberal Party, I respect the concerns of some colleagues about democratic developments in Austria. You may be surprised by my reaction if I say that I fully understand the particular sensitivity toward Austria on issues related to respect for human rights, the awareness of responsibility for its own past, and the stability of democracy. Austria itself must respond to the often dubious image that prevails abroad, whether justified or unjustified.	es
"On the basis of these assessments, we wish to express our firm opposition to the ""modernisation"" of social protection promoted by the Commission in its communication, concluding that we cannot give our assent to the report presented by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. This concludes the explanations of vote. (The sitting, suspended at 1.55 p.m., resumed at 3 p.m.) Next UN ""Human Rights"" session (continuation) The next item is the Council statement on the Union's priorities for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (20 March 2000), including the situation in China. Mr President, I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council; this is a statement by the Council, and it would perhaps have been useful for a Council representative to be present for the continuation of the debate. I do not think it is idle to point out that the reason for including this item on the agenda was the need, expressed by all the political groups, for Parliament to organise a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva to make its voice heard on a subject it considers to be of fundamental importance. I believe that, following the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, we are all in agreement that the current situation, as regards human rights, is very far from what we would like it to be. At Union level, we must say that the situation is not very satisfactory, since, for example, although the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a common element for all the Member States, the subsequent protocols have not been ratified or signed by all of them. Furthermore, it is a clear drawback in this respect that the European Union as such is not a signatory to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with all the consequences that this situation entails. I hope that these problems can be addressed and discussed in the debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. On the external level, I believe that most of the points included in the resolution give us a vision that is fairly close to reality and do not at all invite optimism, Mr President, given that aspects such as the abolition of the death penalty, torture still practiced in many countries that claim to be democratic or the situation of minorities in many parts of the planet require a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union. In my opinion, this resolution contains a number of essential points, but I would like to focus on one in particular: the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations. Mr President, in a world like the present one, dominated more and more by the phenomenon of globalisation, and not only in the economic sphere, we must give concerted and coordinated responses if they are to be effective. To ensure this effectiveness of our actions, it is necessary to implement in practice a coordination that does not currently exist. For this reason, Parliament defends the principle of the need to participate in the work of the Committee on Human Rights and other international institutions that address these issues. Furthermore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible."	it
Madam President, the assessment of the reform process was certainly very high, which is to be acknowledged, perhaps even somewhat premature. My question: the reform is necessary not least because of the accession of new countries and thus the enlargement of the Union. How can we – the Commission, Parliament, and also the national parliaments of the accession states – meet this challenge more effectively, also taking into account the ideas and considerations of the accession states? The delegations are working actively – I am doing so in my delegation for the Czech Republic – but it is noticeable that we often treat each other in a very patronizing manner. How can the reform contribute to making the relationship and cooperation, the joint work between the European Parliament, the national parliaments, and also the Commission, more effective? I thank the honourable Member for highlighting the fact that the reform, apart from being useful in itself, is necessitated by the accession process and the enlargements, especially the enlargements that the Union will soon undergo. It is important that we carry out this reform not only for the sake of the Union as it currently exists, but also to make accessions possible. In the coming years, I will maintain the practice, which I have already established, of course, together with many of my Commission colleagues, of holding extensive discussions with the governments of the future Member States. We do this because we want to explain to them in every respect the system they will be joining. I would also like to draw attention to the enrichment provided by the training provided both by the Member States and by the Union generally, so that when the new staff join the Commission and the officials and administrators in the Member States have to cope with the realities, the difficult realities, of membership of the Union and the internal market, the breaking points will be hard to detect. I would like to see such a high level of development and preparation. All I can do now is promise to strive for it. First, I would like to wish the Commissioner a happy St. David's Day. Thank you very much for your speech. It is now crucial for the Commission not to lose sight of the fact that the reform process would be a complete waste of time without reconnecting with the European public. This, above all, must never be lost sight of. The Commission must serve the public, and the recommendations to reduce payment delays are certainly most welcome, but another major complaint from the people we represent is the red tape. Is there an intention—without compromising financial control—to reduce bureaucracy and red tape for applicants for European funding? This is constantly being criticized, and action is needed here. My second question concerns the audit follow-up panel. I certainly welcome this very much, but it is also important to include a reference to monitoring the recommendations we make to the European Parliament as part of our discharge procedure. Will you incorporate this into the work of your panel? Finally, I would like to say that the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and the delegation of responsibility. You will be judged, as Mr Prodi put it, by your actions and not by your words.	de
By contrast, the 1995 Convention allows for the opening of ancillary procedures. This creates exceptional situations in addition to the general rule that the Commission would like to see included. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would have preferred to adopt a new text explicitly enshrining the principle of unity. However, I do not believe that now is the time to call into question the agreement reached under the 1995 Convention – which, incidentally, was negotiated over a period of approximately thirty years. Consequently, the Commission has declined to submit a proposal and has limited its views to questions of an institutional nature. For this reason too, the Commission considers that it will not propose an amendment to the Regulation but would like to explain to the Honourable Members its views on the amendments before it. The Commission therefore accepts Amendments 1, 2, 3, and 5 proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner, but not Amendment 4. The Commission considers that Parliament should instead support Amendment 4 tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, to enable the Commission to amend the annexes to the Regulation, assisted by a regulatory committee, in accordance with Article 5 of Resolution EC 1999/468. Consequently, the Commission accepts Amendments 3 and 4 tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, but not Amendments 1 and 2 concerning the concept of 'the debtor's centre of main interests'. The concept of 'the centre of main interests of a company or legal person' is adequately defined in Article 3. For all other cases not directly addressed, the reference in Recital 13 should be considered sufficient. Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m. (The sitting closed at 12.05 a.m.) The shipwreck of the Erika The next item is the debate on Oral Question B5-0011/2000 by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Commission on the shipwreck of the Erika. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to express the appreciation shown by Mr Fischler's presence here today. Yesterday our President announced that he would be absent due to scheduling conflicts. I believe he has reconsidered and done what we have come to expect: he has shown this Parliament his appreciation and respect, as he always has, and for that I thank him. I raise my voice in this House today on behalf of the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries to once again draw attention to the shipwreck of the oil tanker Erika and to express our concern. A twofold political consideration prompts our committee—and me, as its chairman—to raise this matter again. First, to demonstrate to the Commission, the Council, and the Member States that our Parliament cannot and will not forget this grave disaster.	de
We must be assured that the Council acts in accordance with Parliament's approach. Unfortunately, no initiatives have been taken on other issues so far. We are still waiting. The European Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice remains an area lacking clear regulations in important areas. Yet, we owe this to the citizens of Europe. After hearing the comments of the Ministers of Justice and the Interior, I am optimistic. I conclude that we will achieve this within the next six months. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Mrs Terrón I Cusí's oral question is worth putting our foot down, because six months after the establishment of our new Parliament, we must be able to send a strong political message to the citizens of Europe. I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can make a positive contribution to this. We are all aware today of the immense expectations of our fellow citizens in terms of freedom, security, and justice, particularly social justice. But their disinterest, their distance, and sometimes even their disgust with politics urge us to take concrete measures to address their difficulties. This is the sine qua non for reconciling them with politics. For Europe to become a symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a bold and generous policy to help the most disadvantaged. A genuine plan to combat unemployment must be put in place, because it is the scourge on which racism, xenophobia, nationalism, and racist far-right movements thrive. Among the most disadvantaged—and it is important that I speak on this point—are immigrants and refugees. Thus, the almost systematic conditions of detention and the criminalization of asylum seekers are no longer acceptable. Every asylum seeker must have the right to a fair hearing and a suspensive appeal. Last week, somewhat by chance, I witnessed a scene of rare violence at Roissy airport, where two young women, admittedly illegal immigrants, were being deported to Conakry. They were treated like the worst criminals. They were naked, dragged along the ground by their hair, surrounded by a horde of CRS officers. The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this kind of barbaric practice. On the contrary, our role is to support, reassure, and help those fleeing dictatorships. The Commission had proposed the creation of a European refugee fund. Parliament was very much in favor. Instead of procrastinating over the budget allocated to this fund, I believe you can take the decision to establish it. The Presidency and the Council can make concrete what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though Tampere constituted an important foundation. Similarly, we cannot simply observe the rise of xenophobic currents in Europe and the trivialization of discrimination without taking far-reaching measures. Harmonization of anti-racism legislation is essential. What meaning do you intend to give to Article 13 of the Treaty? What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in terms of pay between men and women? How do you intend to work towards the eradication of homophobia, racism, and sexism?	fr
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of this debate, which I have followed with great attention and interest, I would like to offer a few thoughts to complement what I have already had the honor of expressing before you over the past few weeks in the presence of President Prodi. In their very thorough and carefully drafted report, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, recommend that Parliament adopt a formal opinion under Article 48, so that, once the opinion has been adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference can actually begin its work on 14 February, as proposed by the Portuguese Presidency. For our part, having presented the opinion required of the Commission pursuant to the aforementioned Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that this Conference can begin—earlier than originally planned, moreover. We know that the weeks thus gained will be very useful. After reading the draft opinion and listening to the statements made by the speakers from the various political groups, I would like to make a few further comments. First of all, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understands the concerns expressed several times here regarding the scope of the Conference's agenda. I understand these fears, these concerns that the agenda is too short; and yet, as I explained to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs after the Helsinki Summit, I believe that it is possible to work on the basis of the Helsinki mandate. And it is in this spirit and within the framework of this mandate that the Commission has drafted its own opinion, making full use of the mandate and reading between the lines. We have not limited ourselves to what are, incidentally, inaccurately called the three 'leftovers'. Like Richard Corbett, I dislike the term 'leftovers', which suggests that these are three insignificant or marginal issues. But these are three extremely serious, important, and difficult issues—so difficult that in Amsterdam, the collective political courage was not sufficient to deal with them exhaustively. As for us – and here I respond to Mr Seguro, who expressed his concern earlier – we have not been satisfied with these three issues, even though I believe they are priorities and must be addressed now. They are the first, but not the only, issues that the Conference must address, Mr President. We have also addressed other issues, and we have expressed our idea that, given the difficult situation before enlargement, other issues should also be addressed at the Conference – if the Portuguese Presidency and, later, the French Presidency are ready to do so. We are ready to do so – whether it is the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has begun to be drafted, the CFSP and the impact of negotiations on a defence policy on the institutions, or the very difficult issue of the revision of the Treaties, on which we will continue to work. A great many comments have been made on the Commission's opinion; all these issues have been raised and often dealt with in depth, sometimes with precise proposals for new articles. But no one has mentioned that we are outside the Helsinki mandate.	de
Mr President, Commissioners, when this House is called upon to reflect on the subject of human rights, it runs a great risk, which has also been highlighted in some way by the climate in which we are called upon to debate this very important subject. The absence of the Council and of almost all the Members makes us aware of the gulf that still separates noble, profound and formally useful declarations from the practical application of human rights in the field of everyday politics. I believe that this Parliament, starting with the contribution that Europe will make to the Geneva meeting, must bridge this gulf and act, not only on the level of principles, but also on that of truth and even loyalty. Human rights must not be interpreted solely in terms of denunciation or punishment. We must, as a Parliament, address the subject of human rights, above all from the perspective of prevention. We must therefore be able to export a culture of legality, a culture of law, a conformity of law. I believe that the long season of accumulating treaties and treaty signatures is definitively over. We now have many, perhaps too many, treaties that affect human rights: if these treaties remain merely a statement, they will only constitute useless collections of reflection. We must now move on to the next phase, that of the daily and coercive application of what is written in our treaties, even if we must not forget that certain fundamental treaties still need to be accepted. I am thinking here of the Rome Conference and the fact that fourteen of the fifteen States of the Union have not yet ratified the treaty on the International Criminal Court. I think that we must verify and modify certain political instruments that we use to measure the quality of human rights in the world. We have often used instruments that, formally, may be practical but, politically, prove to be completely useless. I am thinking of the use, even abuse, of the embargo in recent years and the overly cautious application of the clause suspending agreements between the European Union and third countries in the event that they fail to respect human rights. I believe that we are above all invited to update the horizon of the protection of fundamental rights. Globalization risks being interpreted as essentially repressive. In many countries, the principle of the universality of human rights is currently being questioned; it is believed that these rights and the right to life, denied by the death penalty, are dependent variables, while globalization, often taken in a punitive sense, risks being the only unifying fabric of the rights, actions, and policies of all the countries of the world.	fr
I therefore consider it necessary to act in two directions. On the one hand, we should call on the Commission to approve, within the framework of the aid provided for the fishing sector, special measures to mitigate the impact of this disaster on the productive sector in the affected areas, and also call on it to demand from international bodies and from itself strict controls on vessels flying flags of convenience. In this regard, the current negotiation process for Malta's accession to the European Union must serve to require that country to rigorously control the oil tankers flying its flag. On the other hand, it is necessary to take preventive measures. Portugal is a country that has abundantly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues related to the sea. I would like to ask the Portuguese Presidency to examine the possibility of launching a comprehensive strategy for the prevention of marine pollution at European level, concentrating all the resources – technological, structural, and socio-economic – that we already have at our disposal to prevent a disaster like this from happening again in the future. Finally, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, which reminded me of times when, as mayor at the time, I experienced similar situations. Thanks must be given to those who, faced with vulnerability and a lack of resources, have courageously fought to combat the serious consequences of this disaster for coastal regions, the marine ecosystem, and Europe's fisheries resources. Mr President, as Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I would like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, on the response it has given to this incident, which has deeply shocked the whole of Europe. We in the Committee on Transport are ready to debate the Commission's communication on maritime safety and, later, of course, the legal conclusions it will draw from it. Allow me to make a few further comments: First, the Commission has rightly focused its investigations on the culpability of the Italian classification society RINA, because it must be examined whether Community law was applied. This is where our efforts must begin. Second, in such cases, we should examine whether, in addition to the shipowners, charterers, such as the oil companies, also bear responsibility, since they are complicit in environmental disasters like this and must therefore also pay for the damage. That said, the responses to this ecological disaster are entirely justified. However, this must not lead us to stigmatize all of merchant shipping, a sector so vital to the economy that accounts for around a third of transport volumes. Our response must therefore be measured, strict, but also reasonable. I am not at all opposed to considering tightening Community law, but, as other colleagues have emphasized, we must start with implementation, because—and we must not forget this—a legal framework already exists at the European Union level. This framework is sufficiently developed, at least when one compares the various regulations worldwide. Consequently, the Member States, also under the supervision of the Commission, must finally begin to actually apply Community law.	de
I have the great pleasure of handing the floor now to Prime Minister António Guterres. I thank the President-in-Office of the Council, António Guterres, and I now hand over to the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi. . Madam President, first of all I would like to warmly congratulate Prime Minister Guterres on the initiative that has been taken for the Lisbon Summit, and on the quality of the preparatory work. We fully share his analysis that we have heard and that has been so warmly applauded, and we support his initiative. I believe that together we can make Lisbon a successful Summit. In this speech I will simply present to you the Commission's contribution to Lisbon: our long-term strategy and our vision for this Summit. In Lisbon we have to decide on something very simple, and that is whether Europe can regain its long-lost leadership in the economy and technology. This depends on us, on the economic growth that we will be able to impose on the European system, on the level of employment that we will be able to create, on the level of education of our citizens, on the training of our working class. These are not new issues, as Prime Minister Guterres said. In fact, we are not doing another Luxembourg-type, Cardiff-type, Cologne-type exercise, but we want to address these issues, which we have already addressed, with a completely new approach: not one issue at a time but all together, to finally build a system of interventions. We are doing it now because it is the moment in which all this can succeed. In fact, we have a unique opportunity before us, an opportunity that has been built on the success of a wise policy implemented in the recent past: we have low inflation, a globally healthy balance of payments, public accounts in order, and we finally have unanimous forecasts of very strong economic growth, forecasts, as the Portuguese Prime Minister underlined, which do not however mean certainty of economic growth. Never before in the last generation has there been such unanimity among all scholars in Europe in predicting a possible long period of high growth. Not even with the increase in the price of oil has there been an interruption in this growth nor a recovery in inflation, as one might have feared. There are, however, some worrying signs, which however do not prevent us from continuing a development policy as we had thought and planned. The challenges of Lisbon are therefore very simple: we must respond to the technological challenge by recovering lost ground in the field of knowledge, of knowledge, of technologies, especially of reform technologies. We can thus return to a leading position; this is why we have taken the e-EUROPE initiative, thanks to which the Commission has decided, in its administrative reform, to give a concrete example. We have committed ourselves - and it is a commitment that I confirm in front of you - to create a Commission, we could better say an e-Commission, in the sense that every relationship of supplies, research, etc. with this Institution will no longer have to take place on paper but directly electronically.	it
"Major public investments have been made at the federal, state, and local levels. They have been enormous, and they have been investments in new infrastructure. Be careful, here our direct effort—I repeat, direct at the public level and at different levels—is to build telematic highways, that is, the roads on which these new vehicles circulate. The market, individuals, and companies will build the vehicles for circulation, but we are the ones who have the obligation to build the new highways. Therefore, what Prime Minister Guterres said about computers in all schools, about the network that must include all peripheral regions, is not an obligation that can be imposed exclusively on the market, since the market does not do this, and, moreover, without it, we will not achieve these new development and productivity goals that are necessary. Therefore, our problem is to avoid a crisis in peripheral economies, which does not imply centralization or centralized programming, but rather requires providing peripheral economies with the same opportunities that we provide to centralized economies. This is why the program must be directed at schools; this is why we must address an entire age group and insist on ensuring that no one in that age group is left out of the new literacy program. Lisbon, therefore, has a very precise strategy. In Lisbon, in my opinion, the real problem is injecting new value into employment and growth, knowing that we can do it, and therefore, we must move toward this model based on secure balances. To summarize today's debate, I would like to recall a phrase used by one of your honorable Members, if I recall correctly, Mr. Goebbels, who said: ""We have a deficit of the future in Europe."" It's simply that. We have complained for a long time, while the seeds of what we had planted with great sacrifice in the roots of Europe matured instead. Now, please, let us also try to close the deficit of the future and give meaning to the new generations, knowing that we are working together soberly but seriously for something lasting. Clearly, then, it is essential to bring together the three processes. Unfortunately, our terminology is horrendous, but we truly bring together the problems of macroeconomics, labor, and structural problems now, and then we have the capacity and the possibility of achieving the results we desired, with very simple, even specific, actions. We remember European society: we have not yet achieved unanimity regarding European society, but there are hundreds of thousands of companies asking us for it. It must be done at all costs because the very idea of operating in fifteen states that are becoming one with different rules regarding the basic principles of business is an unsustainable idea: we can't sell it because it doesn't make sense. The same goes for the European patent: we can't sell it either; the provisions relating to public tenders, the capital markets; also the seeds of social security coordination, because it's useless for us to think about great opportunities for mobility, to create highly successful programs like ERASMUS and SOCRATES to make people more mobile, if we then don't have social security regulations that don't help us with this mobility."	es
Commissioner, we are facing a reform whose importance cannot be overstated. It transcends competition, it transcends the cohesion of the internal market. I believe it profoundly affects the very meaning of European integration, the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration. Therefore, Commissioner, we count on this interinstitutional dialogue to outline a reform that we all look forward to and which we believe we will bring to fruition with your guidance and our cooperation. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great interest shown in competition issues. Mr. President, in my opinion, this joint debate is the most vivid and valuable testimony to this. We have heard very profound considerations that, at the same time, reflect the philosophy of economic policy and the analysis of the institutional structure. Our common aim is to modernize and strengthen competition policy, a pillar of the social market economy and European integration. The common thread running through all these aspects of competition policy reform, which we will address together, is a thread aimed at ensuring more effective protection of competition, reducing the bureaucratic burden on businesses, and bringing decision-making processes closer to the public. I would like to personally and profoundly thank Mr. von Wogau for the dedication with which he has examined the dossier on the White Paper and the quality of his report. I would like to group the considerations made throughout the debate on the von Wogau report into four points that I do not consider criticisms of the Commission, but rather fundamental contributions, given that there are concerns that are right to have and that we want to overcome together: the issue of effectiveness, the risk of renationalization, the issue of consistency in application, and legal certainty. I will examine them very quickly one by one. Effectiveness: I am convinced that this reform makes it possible to strengthen, not weaken, the protection of competition within the single market. Ladies and gentlemen, the current notification system no longer allows this objective to be achieved, because it does not guarantee that the Commission is informed about the most serious restrictions—I recall that in thirty-five years, only nine prohibition decisions have been adopted after notification and in the absence of a complaint—it does not guarantee transparency and does not provide real legal certainty for companies, which, in most cases, receive a simple administrative letter that is filed away. The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, first of all because it will allow the Commission to focus its action on the most serious restrictions and, therefore, because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater extent in the suppression of violations. Finally, because it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect individual rights. The question of renationalization: first of all, although it is superfluous, I would like to recall and underline, if possible three times, that the White Paper does not in the least affect mergers and State aid—we are not considering a repayment in these matters—but, as far as Regulation No. 17 is concerned, there is a risk of renationalization.	es
"We know the rest. We should then establish reliable technical inspections, similar to the mandatory technical inspections in France for vehicles over five years old. We should regulate the use of flags of convenience, require double hulls for the transport of polluting or hazardous materials, and innovate technologically to treat or collect hydrocarbons at sea. This would be, I think, the very least we can do at the dawn of the third millennium. We should ban non-compliant vessels from accessing European waters, determine the liability of polluters, shipowners, and charterers in the name of the ""polluter pays"" principle, strengthen maritime surveillance to prevent any degassing, impose serious and reliable inspections of tankers, reinstate a substantial ""natural disasters"" budget line for member states, and, in the meantime, release exceptional community aid and make disaster-stricken departments eligible for Structural Funds. I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD group. Mr. President, in recent years, oil tanker disasters have regularly occurred around the world without any meaningful or effective measures being taken. This time, it is particularly serious, also because it affected a major European state, an event that could happen again at any time. To limit these dangers, we urgently need a directive. The Fifteen are clearly not enough. Without claiming to be exhaustive, this would guarantee at least three points: no cargo ship or oil tanker will be able to anchor in a European Union port if it is destined for the scrapyard; all parties involved, including the transport charterer, are liable for any damage that may occur; and these parties must take out adequate insurance. Only in this way will the victims have a chance of having their claims for compensation met. However, we must recognize that the long-term objective must go even further. This means that we really need to establish the true costs for our entire energy supply system. Mr President, let me begin by thanking Commissioner de Palacio for the appropriate, clear and firm response she has given. I thank her very, very sincerely for it. This means that I also have the greatest respect for the information note she sent us on 10 January, but also for the actions she announced today. The Erika disaster highlights the fact that when strict transport regulations are lacking at European and international level, nature and the environment always suffer. The resulting damage, particularly from an ecological point of view, cannot be expressed in monetary terms. This is also why the debate is taking place jointly with my colleagues from the transport and environment sectors. During the Christmas holidays, when the Dutch media were focusing on the Erika disaster, I took a look on the Internet to get an idea of the situation and see what measures should be taken, especially after Prime Minister Jospin said that Europe should be more active in this area."	fr
The Commission's delays must be reflected in the proposed timetable, so the 2003 date must necessarily be revised. While defining a sector reserved for public postal operators, based on weight and price limits, the postal services directive would allow for phased and controlled liberalization. The brutal reduction of these limits calls into question the balance between public service obligations and economic viability for postal services. In a context of globalization, where the logic of profitability and profit increasingly conflicts with the interest of territorial balance and social cohesion, it is urgent to recall here our commitment to the European public service, whether it concerns the postal sector today, the railway sector tomorrow, or the health sector the day after tomorrow. Mr. President, I am taking the floor, along with other Scottish members of this House, representing Scotland, to protest against anything that leads to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote areas. The post service and post offices are an essential element of the life of rural communities throughout Europe, not to mention Scotland. It would be a disaster if, intentionally or even unwittingly, measures were taken that would harm them. I do not believe that anyone intends to do anything like that. Nor do I believe that the Commission intends to declare war on the islands of Scotland or Greece. But they could accidentally cause great harm. The question is how quickly and by what methods the gradual liberalization of postal services should be carried out. If the limit for continuing the monopoly right of the postal service were set too low, it would become uneconomical to maintain universal service in remote areas at a price that remained affordable. The crucial question is to find a balance between universality and affordability. The message being conveyed very clearly from all parts of the House to the Commission today is that it must tread carefully. It should not, for example, jump from 350 grams to, as someone has suggested, 50 grams. On the contrary, it should proceed with caution. I imagine that anything less than 150 grams would be extremely unwise in these circumstances. The solidarity and cohesion of the peoples of all Europe depend on the belief that a letter can be sent anywhere and that it will be delivered anywhere else, all with a reasonably priced stamp. Let us defend universality and affordable prices! Mr. President, to guarantee a quality universal postal service, it is essential that its public character be maintained. Universal service, which entails the provision of quality postal services at affordable prices and provided throughout the country, constitutes the basis for the entire functioning of the postal system and must provide uniform rates throughout the national territory. However, for this to be the case, it is essential that it be maintained as a public service. Only in this way is it possible to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, is an integral network that cannot be fragmented or used only in part according to the convenience of the postal service operators.	es
However, the fear that this will lead to the creation of a European institution that restricts subsidiarity is unfortunately still too great. In any case, I will contribute my part to increasing support for Mrs. Theato's report. Mr. President, we are basically in favor of the resolution submitted to us, although we believe that this can only be an invitation from Parliament to the Council to ensure, through a Treaty amendment, effective criminal protection of the Union's financial interests. The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor and the establishment of common criminal categories for all Union states is undoubtedly a good idea; however, I consider it impossible to consider putting it into practice without first creating a Union judicial system. We are, in fact, talking about criminal law, an area in which national states' resistance to communitarization is and always will be strong. In fact, it is unthinkable that substantive and procedural legal rules can be established for a single area, such as the protection of financial interests, without first creating a European judicial system. One need only read the precise and exhaustive justifications of the Theato report to realize how many and what problems still remain to be solved. Nevertheless, this idea must be promoted, and there is no doubt that in this attempt to protect financial interests, we will realize the need for a Community corpus juris, which must be incorporated into the Treaties. On behalf of my group and myself, I also express the hope that the financial soul of the Union will serve as a guide in establishing a European judicial system that respects the rights and guarantees of citizens; that is, a judicial system that enhances the guarantees that, unfortunately, in many states fall far short of acceptable levels. Consequently, on behalf of my group, I express a favorable opinion of the Theato report; However, I believe that, in substance, this is an issue that should be included on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference. Mr. President, Mrs. Theato's report on the protection of the European Union's financial interests proposes, in particular, in a first phase, centralizing criminal proceedings through the creation of a European Public Prosecutor. This proposal goes radically against the spirit of the current system, in which criminal law and criminal procedure, which constitute the core of national legal systems, must depend on the sovereignty of each people and be the exclusive competence of each State. However, the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the contrary, aims to relegate States over time to a subordinate role in these matters. Furthermore, this proposal would trigger a succession of completely unpredictable reforms. According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor would be necessary, in particular, to better frame the investigations of the Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF. But at the same time, we learned, in the Van Hulten report being debated today, that the European prosecutor would in turn be supervised by a European Union court.	es
I am therefore pleased that responsibility is being attributed to individuals without the Commission shirking its responsibility. In practice, experience – only 9 files were rejected, 94% of the cases the Commission had to deal with were not resolved formally but through unpublished, legally non-binding administrative letters, or simply by the expiry of the deadline – clearly shows that in the age of globalization and EU enlargement, the Commission's work is limited by time, personnel, and financial constraints. In conclusion, I would like to say what I expect from this reform: fair competition and the same competitive conditions for all, legal certainty for all companies, uniform application of competition policy, simplification of procedures in accordance with the one-stop-shop principle, coordination of national authorities, which I believe should be independent, close cooperation between national authorities and courts and the Commission, and a clear division of powers between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and antitrust law. I expect the Commission to focus on the essentials by fulfilling its duties as the main guardian of European competition policy. I look forward to seeing what form the wide-ranging discussions in the first legislative proposal will take. The Commission's report confirms that, with the exception of Germany, state aid to companies is increasing. This only concerns the Commission from the perspective of competitive conditions. For our part, we are taking the view that the interests of the working classes are in the best interests of the people. Society gains nothing from these enormous transfers of public funds to private companies. Look at the automobile industry, where subsidies and various forms of state aid increased by 24% during the reference period. To what end? It's not to preserve jobs. All these companies have cut jobs, even layoffs. It's not to improve working conditions, because by producing more with fewer workers, working conditions worsen. Did these companies need state aid to survive? No, automobile companies have been raking in colossal profits for years. State aid is not only perverse because, as the Jonckheer report recognizes, it leads to a hunt for subsidies through offshoring from one country to another; it is unacceptable because it devotes public money to enriching a handful of private shareholders. It is because everywhere the richest are being favoured with state money that social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, and hospitals are being closed throughout Europe. The purpose of my vote against the Jonckheer report is to affirm the need for a different policy, that is, the cessation of all aid to private companies and the use of the money thus saved to develop public services and hire staff for them. Mr President, the debate we are holding today is of extraordinary importance because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market. In application of the principle of competition, the regulation developed Articles 85 to 94, competition policy itself, the review of all state aid and tax provisions likely to distort competition.	fr
In the next IGC resolution, Parliament will have to deal in depth with the issues of diversification and flexibility. If we fail to create the system of concentric layers proposed by the Liberal Group, we will jeopardise the process of enlargement and integration. My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta, have already expressed a rather sceptical opinion on some aspects of the issue we are dealing with; I would like to express my concern about subsidiarity, not so much with regard to relations between the Union and the Member States, but rather with regard to relations between individual Member States and the regions which, within them, enjoy administrative autonomy. This is a subject which has not been sufficiently reflected upon and which is a source of concern from many points of view. I would like to highlight in particular one of the consequences that enlargement will have on this Parliament. A ceiling of 700 Members has been set, which represents the maximum number of Members with which Parliament can continue to function as a deliberative assembly. By applying the principle of digressive proportionality (six seats for each state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants), we already have a situation whereby Luxembourg, with 367,000 inhabitants, sends more MEPs to this Parliament than Wales, a region which, within the United Kingdom, enjoys partial administrative autonomy; Scotland, with 5 million inhabitants, currently has eight MEPs, while Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have 16. What will happen now if we maintain the ceiling of 700 members, gradually increase the population of the European Union by 26 percent and then adopt the Commission's (in my opinion unfortunate) proposal to draw up a list of candidates on a European basis? What will happen to a country like Scotland, which I represent here? It will become completely invisible! In these circumstances, Members of this House should not be surprised if, in discussing these issues, public opinion in Scotland and other countries in the same situation is beginning to ask whether enlargement should not take the form of the admission of new Member States from among the existing Member States. There is a growing body of opinion in Scotland that is moving in that direction. Mr President, it has often been said that the European Union is at a crossroads. This time it is the truth: we have launched - very successfully - the single currency and enlargement awaits us. We are wondering whether we are heading towards enlargement prepared or not. Will it be superficial enlargement or in depth? That is the crux of the debate when it comes to the Intergovernmental Conference, the agenda and the method. The Council has clearly chosen, for the time being, to enlarge without deepening. That is a danger to enlargement; a danger to any prospect of political union. The public will have difficulty understanding. The Council must realise that if the future of the Union is to be built on the foundations of a solid enlargement, it must go much further in the next Intergovernmental Conference.	it
The crisis of the Commission was, in fact, a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens, and the low turnout in the European elections was a worrying sign of this. Even deeper, however, is the sense of insecurity, the feeling of unpreparedness in the face of a new world that is advancing, a world that is changing completely, which through globalization ends up changing even our points of reference. This is not a completely new fact in history: Europe has already found itself faced with a similar change on another occasion, an explosion of its markets, a change in the parameters of reference, a different perception of the world. I am referring to the sixteenth century, after the discovery of America, when everything changed. Some countries - like France and Spain - were able to respond to the challenge by creating large national states; other countries - like Italy - were unable to cope with this challenge and lost all the records that they had accumulated in the first part of the millennium: records of science, technology, economic progress, defense structures and military organization, thought and literature. Today Europe is facing a similar challenge, and we know that, just as History has not forgiven in the past, it does not forgive today. In this perspective of great changes, to prevent our nation states from disappearing in the face of globalization, which poses unprecedented dimensions and challenges in our history, an economically strong Europe is necessary, because globalization requires unity, because every day we hear news of new agreements at a global level and every day we hear news of changes at a European level too. But even more necessary is a Europe that feels strong in the political field. In past years, the single market and the single currency have been the fulcrum of our action, the cornerstone of European life. Today, the new frontiers of European integration are political frontiers: common foreign and security policy, justice and internal security and - in a secondary order - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based. For this reason, the Commission has approved the strategic plan 2000-2005, a plan that was immediately sent to the European Parliament, which you already know and which, therefore, I will not go into in detail in this speech. Some may perhaps consider it too synthetic, but no political structure produces detailed five-year plans. This is the European Union, not the Soviet Union. Our plan identifies the major points of reference, the major directions of intervention: first, the development of new forms of government for Europe; second, the expansion and enlargement of the area of peace, freedom and security; third, the launching of a new phase of economic development; fourth, the protection and improvement of the quality of life. These are our major guidelines for action for the next five years. As regards the first - new forms of government for Europe - you already know that the Commission has committed to presenting a White Paper, and not a complete legislative text because, faced with the major problems that structurally change our way of being together, the Commission first prepares the debate; then it discusses its content with you; from here then a political document is born, and finally a legislative document.	it
It will then eventually be necessary, as I have emphasized, to change the paradigm and forget the post-colonial paradigm in order to give a more European dimension to development policies. From this point of view, I believe (like some speakers) that the new convention intended to replace the Lomé Conventions constitutes an important instrument of renewal and new dynamics in the approach to a partnership with such a large group of countries of the South, at a time when there is stability around negotiation processes at the international level, such as those that characterized the first round of the Seattle negotiations. I sense a certain degree of frustration in many contributions to this debate. I have made a statement to you on behalf of the Commission which, I believe, provides a useful framework for this discussion. We will provide more detailed information directly related to all the issues of coherence. This debate is not new. We are currently working on it within the Commission and, once the work is completed, I will present a report on the matter, since many have asked if it would be possible to see the report on coherence. I have no doubt that, because of the growing political attention being paid to these problems - which has clearly emerged from today's debate - it will be easier for the Commission and DG Development to put the issue of coherence at the top of our agenda. This also requires the introduction of additional new mechanisms within the Commission system, which may well include, as some political groups in this Parliament have suggested, the establishment of a special inter-service working group and some form of coherence monitoring within the Commission. I have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as a kind of magic bullet that fixes everything. I think it is important to leave it as a relatively well-defined discipline aimed at trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really do exist, and they most certainly do. Much of this has to do with a real disagreement between sectoral interests in each Member State, as has been said with great honesty in this House. People identify in a certain way with their spheres of interest, which is legitimate. I would, however, caution against the illusion that the inconsistency results from some mechanical deficiency in the system. This happens but represents only a small part of what we are discussing. Most of the debate relates to the well-known differences in interests established between genders and so on, and that is the problem. Mr. Mulder said that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low. This is true in our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective. They are farmers, not only to earn a living, but also to live; that makes a difference.	fr
English: We have recently had occasion to use the precautionary principle to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys and of course we apply it in many environmental areas. It is mostly used when environmental problems are involved, but of course also when human health is involved. We will therefore try to define very clearly the cases in which this principle should be applied. Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the relationship between science on the one hand and the use of the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that the use of this principle always requires a political decision in the absence of scientific evidence. This statement gives great power to science. We can ask ourselves who the experts are who will provide the required documentation and what position they will defend. The communication also states that a sufficient and recognised minority of scientific experts can also invoke the precautionary principle. I would like to know what the definition of a recognised minority is. How can this concept be described? How is a recognised minority created? If it is a political decision, I would like to know who will take it. The Commission? The Council? What role will be assigned to the European Parliament? What is the role of the scientific committees? What is the role of the food authorities that will be appointed shortly? Finally, will the decision-making process be transparent and public? These are the three questions I would like to ask. That is true, Mr President, the problems have been many, complex and sometimes obscure, but I will try to answer them anyway. Who will decide and who are the decision-makers? It depends on who is in the role of legislator; it is part of risk management. For example, it will be necessary to take into account public concern about a specific problem and judge on the basis of the scientific evidence available for a given case. It is true, however, that a strong majority of the scientific community is not necessary to resort to the precautionary principle; it is sufficient for there to be evidence put forward by a minority, or for science to be unable to give precise answers. In this way, a balance is maintained between the use of this principle as a political tool and science. It is not always easy to describe precisely how this process unfolds, but it is not a question of changing the scientific method. We use experts to acquire as much information and scientific facts as possible before making a decision, and I think that it will be good to behave in this way in the future too. This method should be seen as a tool for managing risks: we have to decide, for example, whether we should allow the population to be exposed to some risk, or whether we want to protect the environment. It is therefore necessary to take into account the available scientific data. We have to evaluate all these factors and evaluate what science tells us, and then decide whether or not to adopt a measure, whether or not to act. So there is no answer to all the questions, but this does not change the scientific system we have today, nor the way in which we use experts today.	it
Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96/71 on minimum wages, which already applies and therefore does not require any changes to the text. If the Commission were to accept Amendment No 17, this would mean introducing a simple obligation to notify in the event of failure to issue a valid card. It is clear that this provision is contrary to the public order interests of the Member States. Nor can we accept Amendment No 19 for the reasons I have already raised in relation to Amendment No 10. The Commission's position is essentially the same in relation to similar amendments tabled for the second proposal. Let me also add that Amendment No 10 to the second proposal is completely unacceptable. As regards Amendment No 15 on the definition of self-employed workers, as I have just said, the Commission will seek an appropriate solution which takes account of the objections raised. I now come to Lord Inglewood's observation. He referred to the existing border controls for the United Kingdom. In this connection I would like to point out that there is no obligation for a Member State - and therefore also the United Kingdom - to abolish or change the border controls that still exist. This applies, as I said, to the United Kingdom, but it also applies to Belgium, where the problem has recently arisen. As regards Mr Karas's comments, I have the impression that he was referring to the possibility of workers from Poland being employed in his country. The Commission would like to propose a solution that applies to all companies established in the European Union that employ workers from third countries. The question is whether the two cases should be addressed simultaneously. In my view, this issue is part of the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps should not be addressed here. On behalf of the Commission, I would like to confirm to Mr Karas that I am at his complete disposal should he require further information on this very important point. Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the most important aspects of these proposals and, of course, to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mrs Berger. Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. Court of First Instance Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his report which, at first reading, gives the impression of merely confirming and accepting. Behind this report, however, lies a long and effective effort which has already borne some fruit; in fact, the Finnish Presidency document of 7 December 1999 included a commitment to broaden the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include the study of a future change in the organisation, composition and powers of the Community courts. I therefore express my recognition of the work of Vice-President Marinho. Mr President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an urgent necessity if in future we wish to do justice within reasonable time limits, if in future the European Union wishes to equip itself with a justice system worthy of the political project already underway.	it
Mr President, the Commission's proposal for the further controlled and gradual opening of the postal market to competition is delayed mainly because of the reorganisation of services and the reallocation of powers of the Commission, as well as the need for the new College to re-examine these issues. As regards the various resolutions of Parliament concerning the postal sector, my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, has already responded to the main comments during the hearings which were organised by Parliament last year. Furthermore, as regards the consultation of Parliament, Commissioner Bolkestein will meet Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism next Monday. The studies were sent to that Committee in September 1999, as well as to the Members who requested them, and are still available. These studies can also be consulted on the Commission's Internet site. I am sure that Commissioner Bolkestein will pay due attention to all Parliament's comments. The Commission, Mr President, is firmly convinced of the need for a new proposal for the further development and evolution of the postal sector. Moreover, the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation. I can confirm that it is Commissioner Bolkestein's firm intention to submit such a proposal to the Commission, for transmission to Parliament and the Council, within the first half of the year. The date set for the implementation of the next phase, 1 January 2003, remains the Commission's ambition. The proposal will take into account the studies carried out, and in particular the need to ensure universality of service, the development of effective consumer safeguards, the creation of a climate favourable to new jobs and the resolution of competition problems. The role of market opening, with a view to further modernising and improving postal services throughout the Union with new technologies, will also be examined in view of the potential benefits for the industry as a whole. The proposal, when it is presented, will take into account the views expressed by Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers, their competitors and other interested parties, with whom thorough consultations have been carried out. The aim is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for postal services in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the Union. Mr Markov, you will be given the opportunity to speak in 5-6 minutes, but in the meantime please do not interrupt my fellow Members. Mr President, there is a mystery here. What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was adopted on 15 December 1997? Since then there has been a heavy silence from the Commission. I regret that it is Commissioner Monti who has to answer. I respect him very much and I believe that he is one of the most diligent and active Commissioners. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for some of his colleagues. During this period, no progress has been made on the Postal Services Directive. Commissioner Monti said that this was partly due to organizational reasons and the reallocation of responsibilities.	it
This second option has prevailed, and I welcome it, but I hope that, in the future, coordination between the two institutions and the Council will be closer so that our work is more understandable, more fruitful, and more productive. Mr. President, our objective in establishing a framework for investment funds and other UCITS is to ensure maximum benefits for our investors' savings without subjecting them to great risks, which is why I wish to address the issue of derivatives in my remarks today. I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can contribute to consolidating safer and higher returns. Despite their reputation for danger, derivatives are generally used by asset managers as a precaution. A contract that, for example, pays a substantial sum if, say, the NASDAQ or CAC 40 index falls, triggers an additional payment by the investor if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 index rises. Is that speculation? Not at all. Let's imagine we've spent several months building a portfolio of companies we feel confident about: well-managed, with good prospects, and a good investment. Then we worry that the entire stock market might crash, as it did in 1987. In that case, we have the option to sell everything and cash in, but that would mean losing all the research we've done on the winners. It would also mean incurring all the transaction costs involved in selling our holdings and then buying them back after the crash. The solution is to take out a derivative that compensates us if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls. But even with tailored derivatives or cheaper OTC derivatives that could insure against a relative decline in our portfolio relative to the index, we would still own the portfolio and the holdings, but we would have protected ourselves against the dangers of a sharp decline. In return, we may have gotten rid of some of the market's strongest stocks. In that case, which may be the most widespread use of derivatives by asset managers, we reduce our potential reward, but we also reduce our risk factor. This is a desirable development in a well-managed fund. History shows that investors benefit from a liberal, lean approach. An authoritarian system—a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest—will only reduce returns for investors. Pension funds that are subject to regulations on where they can and cannot invest, as required for our government bonds, earn returns of 5.2% per year, barely half the 9.5% annual returns that free funds earned between 1984 and 1996. We are talking, of course, about returns after all losses have been deducted. Let us not confuse genuine concern for investors' interests with a populist fear of a new, innovative, liberal approach that is worthwhile. That is what we should be dealing with here today. Mr. President, the report presented to us today seeks to end the free movement of financial investments in Europe, even in its most sophisticated forms.	es
What can the European Union do in a context which, without interfering in matters which are the exclusive competence of the Cypriots, can promote the search for a just and lasting solution to this dramatic problem which affects a country which has been linked to the European Community for almost 30 years and which will be called upon to join the European Union in the coming years? I have heard, particularly from the Council, proposals or silences which are a little ambiguous, which in my opinion must be clearly clarified. I think that it is up to us first of all to recall the main reference on this matter for the entire international community, namely the resolutions of the United Nations. According to the Security Council, the solution to the Cyprus problem must be sought within the framework of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation, in other words a single State - Commissioner Verheugen alluded to this - which includes two local administrations mandated by the two communities. Sovereignty, international personality and citizenship must be single and this State must be demilitarised. In this way, the international community clearly indicates that it rejects a fait accompli by force. Secondly, I think the European Union benefits from reducing as much as possible the margin for interpretation of the position defined by the Helsinki European Council. The solution to the Cyprus problem cannot be a precondition for Cyprus's accession to the Union, as Mr Poos pointed out, otherwise we would in fact end up giving Turkey a sort of veto right over Cyprus's accession to the European Union, which is unacceptable. Thirdly, finally, the position of the Helsinki European Council cannot lead to a reduction in our efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem before that country joins the Union. From this point of view, the other decision of Helsinki, namely the recognition of Turkey's candidacy for the Union, gives the Fifteen a new responsibility while at the same time offering the Union new opportunities. In my opinion, the dialogue with Ankara can and must integrate the determined will to obtain from Turkey the expression of a constructive attitude towards the dialogue between the two Cypriot communities, respectful of international law and which will allow the reunification of Cyprus and peace in the Eastern Mediterranean. Mr President, while we are practically all in agreement on the importance of financial support for Cyprus and Malta, the same cannot be said with regard to the budget heading from which the necessary funds should be drawn. The Council and the Commission propose to include the protocols in heading 4, a proposal which is in line with the budget decisions adopted by Parliament last December; the rapporteur returns to his position and now proposes to include financial support for Cyprus and Malta in heading 7. For its part, the Committee on Budgets even proposes to postpone the approval of the Brok report until the Council decides to raise the ceiling of heading 7, but this is an extremely risky strategy because, without a prior vote by Parliament, the financial protocols cannot be activated. Cyprus and Malta are therefore paying the price of a political game played by the Council and Parliament on the ceilings. Besides, what is the point of establishing ceilings if, with each new action, they are continually raised?	it
The Presidency takes note of your concerns and will pass them on through the appropriate channels. Intercommunal violence in Mitrovica and the situation of Albanian prisoners in Serbia, in particular the case of Flora Brovina). (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have not signed this compromise resolution for two reasons. Firstly, one of our colleagues, who is known for his open and tolerant attitude, Mr Sakellariou - I shall not name him - vehemently vetoed it because he wanted to defend your moral values. I have no doubt, and I am sure you will have no doubt either, that this is yet another important contribution he is making to the fight against racism and intolerance. Secondly, this resolution is unfortunately not very far-reaching. A number of tricks have carefully avoided addressing the central issue, namely the final status of Kosovo. None of you would assume that Kosovo could one day still be part of Yugoslavia. Likewise, none of you would assume that Milosevic could hold on for long if the international community were to finally find a solution to the question of Kosovo's final status. Finally, none of you would believe that, in the current situation, Milosevic has no interest in doing everything in his power to destabilize Kosovo, which he is doing and which we have already seen. Ultimately, in my opinion, none of you can believe that the current status quo contributes even the slightest to the stability and thus to the development of Kosovo. Incidentally, it is interesting to read a slip-up in the compromise proposal that undoubtedly escaped you. In it, you condemn the first direct attack on KFOR members. While I don't want you to be a prophet of doom, I fear that you will ultimately be one if you don't address the real problem, and I hold you fully responsible for what may happen. Rather, I believe that we must call on the Commission and the Council, which is unfortunately absent today, to raise firmly at the United Nations the question of Kosovo's final status, the growing number of small states in the region, the post-Dayton developments, and, finally, the question of genuine stability, which will finally make it possible to build democracy in these countries and to develop a Community policy in the region. Finally, I would like to point out that since July we have been calling for decisive action by the Council and the Commission to release the 3 000 Kosovo Albanian prisoners, as well as Mrs Brovina, Mr Kurti, and Mr Hoti. I note that the Union is moving towards a certain easing of sanctions, without, as yet, a single one of these prisoners being released in return. Why? Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica, Kosovo, is horrific and reprehensible. Violence breeds violence, revenge breeds revenge. The police forces deployed are not strong enough to put an end to what is happening. Chief Police Commissioner Svend Frederiksen has expressed his despair at being able to permanently only have half of the agreed forces at his disposal.	de
I have been informed that ISA is not pathological in humans or mammals. The disease has existed since 1984 and has not been reported to affect human or mammalian health. The virus harms cold-blooded animals. It does not reproduce at temperatures above 25°C, and if present in fish intended for human consumption, it would be inactive upon ingestion. However, under no circumstances should infected fish be used for human consumption. As an added precaution, I have consulted the Scientific Committee on this matter. During the debate, several important issues, including compensation, related to our disease control strategy were raised. I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry. You may be aware that, with effect from 15 January 2000, under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance, Member States will support disease eradication in aquaculture. The Commission services are drafting implementing rules to ensure the practical application of this instrument. Council Decision 90/424 constitutes another instrument of Community financial support in the event of disease outbreaks. However, I must emphasize that there are significant impediments. Budgetary resources are very limited, and priorities must be established with other diseases. Therefore, further reflection is needed. I regret, therefore, that I am not currently in a position to accept amendments relating to compensation through Decision 90/424. This is particularly the case with Amendments 3 and 5. However, I agree with the statement in Amendment 2 that no compensation has been paid to salmon farmers. I am not in a position to comment on the availability of commercial insurance. The Commission has included in its proposal the possibility of vaccinating salmon. The objective of this proposal is to introduce an instrument to combat the disease in emergency situations. I believe that a vaccine should not be used for preventive purposes, as Amendment 4 suggests. Experience in other sectors has shown that preventive vaccination has the perverse effect of creating healthy carriers of the virus. This could perpetuate an infection. I therefore cannot accept Amendment 4. You have also referred to the need for further scientific research into the nature of the disease. I agree that this research is necessary and understand that it is currently being organized in the United Kingdom. I will closely monitor the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals. It is necessary to examine whether it is appropriate and how research should be organized elsewhere in the Community. In this context, I am happy to partially accept Amendment 1, bearing in mind, however, that scientific research is not carried out by the Commission, although it relies on the results of research carried out in the Member States. I can also partially accept the passage of Amendment 6 that states that Directive 93/53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence. As I have highlighted previously, the available scientific evidence indicates that AIS does not pose a threat to health.	es
The question of whether to extend the agenda still needs to be discussed. In this regard, I would like to commend the political attitude of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly pledged to Parliament to make the necessary efforts in this direction. Moreover, any extension of the agenda must not undermine the importance that each Member State must attach to the IGC, since the institutional framework on which the Europe of the future will be based is the foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the utmost importance for each country of the Union. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of this, I ask the House to approve the opinion presented by Mr Leinen and myself, so that the work of the IGC can begin on 14 February, where our representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, will face a difficult task on the basis of Parliament's assent. This also applies to the Commission and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Barnier again for his contacts with Parliament and for his very constructive proposals. Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party is not satisfied with the outcome of the Helsinki European Council. The agenda seemed to us to be limited because we would have liked to focus on the Treaty, with particular attention to the Protocol on the institutions of the Union. In Helsinki, the governments agreed that as long as the Union has fewer than 21 Member States, a minimal reform will suffice; in reality, a profound reform is needed. The Helsinki European Council itself approved enlargement to include thirteen new Member States. There is clearly a contradiction between the opening of accession negotiations and the desire for a minimal reform. Our attention is instead on the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to enable us to achieve a more profound reform of the Union. Mr President, this debate is taking place today because we did not want to postpone the start of the Conference. We could have done so; we could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th. However, we did not do so because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and countries applying for accession that we wish to proceed with this reform precisely in order to facilitate enlargement. I am pleased to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency, which has acquired great credit in the eyes of this House. The Portuguese Presidency shares many of the aspirations of this Parliament and has undertaken to do everything possible to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is filled with other absolutely necessary subjects. This aspiration of the European Parliament, Mr President, is not a self-interested aspiration. The European Parliament will nevertheless emerge politically strengthened by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference, for one simple reason: the Conference, as agreed in Helsinki, will examine which subjects will be moved from the current unanimous decision-making to qualified majority decision-making. The number of subjects on which decisions will be taken by qualified majority is therefore set to increase. It is now part of the Community heritage that in legislative matters for which decisions are made by qualified majority there is also the co-decision of Parliament.	it
This cannot continue. In a crisis, it must be clear from the outset that the polluter is liable. Mr. President, that was a very good White Paper, and I didn't say a word about the authority. My questions concern the positive list for animal feed. You are unclear on this in your White Paper. What is your timetable? How quickly will you come up with a positive list? When will the same requirements be placed on animal feed and production as on the production and control of food production? The last part of my question: When will BSE testing be mandatory in all member states? Here, too, you remained somewhat unclear in your White Paper regarding the obligation. I would like to thank the Commissioner for his comments. I believe the criteria set for the Food Authority are a concession to reality. Member States would not accept an authority endowed with regulatory powers, so such a proposal would make little sense. Some areas of the food industry clearly need better regulation, and this applies particularly to animal feed. As chair of a committee that will probably spend almost the next three years dealing with food, I must ask the following question: if, as you have said, Europe has the safest food control system, why do we need 24 new directives and regulations, and 20 new directives amending directives? Secondly, will this not exacerbate the problem of over-regulation by Brussels and poor implementation by Member States? On enlargement, what are the Commission's plans to involve the candidate countries in the debate on these new laws, particularly since the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to be part of the acquis communautaire by 2003? Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Ahern, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, and Mrs Jackson for their support for the White Paper. I find this encouraging, and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament on the issues it raises. Mrs Ahern asked about liability. This issue is not explicitly addressed in the White Paper. It merely mentions that we will establish regulations regarding traceability. Some of these already exist. After that, we can address the issue of liability. Despite my own background, I have not yet dealt in depth with liability issues, but I believe that subsidiarity may play a role here. But I have noted your suggestion and will reexamine this question. Ms. Roth-Behrendt asked about the positive list. We will address this issue in the annex to the legislation. The intention is to establish a positive list for animal feed. At present, there is a negative list, so to speak, which will be supplemented as needed. The establishment of the positive list is one of the measures for which a deadline is given in the annex: that will be 2002. The rapid alert system for animal feed is one of the points that we consider to be a weak point in food law. There is a rapid alert system for food, but not for animal feed. That is a shame, and it is wrong. Regulations must be put in place to close this gap, and this will happen.	de
In other words: a decisive leap in development policy is needed if we do not want the rich countries, including the member countries of the European Union, to build bulwarks around themselves to prevent massive immigration. In the global village, the great differences in the world will no longer be tolerated by its poorest part. At a certain point there will be a revolt and it will be absolutely justified. I therefore call on the Presidency of the Council to start the announced debate as soon as possible and above all to conclude it, so that we all, including European citizens, can realise the implications of globalisation, and so that we understand that a central element will be the radical changes in the field of development; as regards our development aid and its level, we are far from the 0.7% on average in the European Union that was promised. It is possible that others will do worse than us, but that certainly does not help us. But above all we must give countries the opportunity to trade with us. As far as I have heard - but I may have missed something - the word trade was not even mentioned in the Prime Minister's speech. I would simply like to say to the Commissioner that I hope that his proposal will be passed on to the Commission and the Member States, and I would also like to ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests that are blocking factors, not only in the Commission, but also in the Member States. I would also like to say that in my opinion the most effective thing would be for Parliament to ask for a proposal from the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development respectively; then we would perhaps have a starting point for discussion, instead of asking for a proposal from all the governments and the whole Commission, because it would be difficult to get anything good out of that. I will conclude with a few words on the Internet revolution. As Commissioner Liikanen is saying, we have a certain advantage in Europe in the mobile telephony sector. Let us use it, not only for the benefit of our own people, but also for the benefit of developing countries. This technique allows precisely the decisive leap that is needed, and in this case, the European Union can set the agenda, influence development and live up to its global responsibility. Mr President, to quote the headline of a newspaper article that appeared last week on the subject of the Union's development policy, I will say that 'The European Union's development cooperation is in a miserable state'. There is nothing new in this statement. Ever since we in Europe have been trying to advance development cooperation, the effectiveness and quality of our efforts have been called into question. There is a danger of widespread distrust about the possibilities for improvement, given that the Commission continues to refuse to look at itself in the mirror. Why has the critical report on the coherence of development policy not been made public? An important conclusion of that report concerned the internal contradictions of European policy.	it
"But I also believe that in the future it will be necessary to create a suitably attractive universal service. We must define it precisely, provide it with a catalogue of services, and put it out to public tender. In the interior of the country, where we reasonably suspect that the service will not be profitable enough to cover costs, in my opinion, services should be established through regulations that guarantee fair and appropriate bidding conditions, so that all market forces, and also, naturally, the existing postal service, can compete, following the strategy of offering users a varied range of quality services. I believe we should prevent further subsidies and, instead, concentrate on ensuring that both private providers and users benefit from the new system. Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, postal services, like all European public services, contribute to the social cohesion of the Community territory, in accordance with the terms of Article 16 of the Amsterdam Treaty. By ensuring a fair distribution of fares, that is, strict equality between citizens and economic actors in the cost of the service, by assuming universal service obligations and adapting to service quality requirements, postal services are part of our concern to promote equality between territories and the people who live in them. Postal services also constitute a powerful, and by no means negligible, element of civic ties. Indeed, as has been pointed out many times in this Assembly, is not the postal worker the last point of contact in the so-called ""desert"" or ""fractured"" territorial areas, whether these are isolated geographical areas or sensitive outskirts of our cities? I will cite as an example the initiative of the French postal service administration, which is preparing to guarantee, among other services, the presence of interpreters and notaries public in post offices in sensitive urban areas. Not to mention the jobs this represents, European public postal service administrations currently employ 1.5 million employees, who could clearly be threatened by the specter of brutal and uncontrolled liberalization. The European Parliament has committed itself to reconciling openness to competition with a universal service obligation that respects employment. We can welcome this, but we will ensure that this path continues, and for this reason we cannot but deplore the fact that the European Parliament is currently kept out of the decision-making process that governs the future of the postal sector in Europe. It is indeed regrettable that until now—as this resolution underlines—the Commission has not taken into account the resolution of 14 January 1999. This resolution, as we must recall, required that the European Parliament be involved in the development of the planned measures and that the reliability of the studies on the effects of liberalization be strengthened. These studies on the effects are necessary to assess the consequences that any brutal liberalization would have not only for the economic organization of the market, but also for its human and social dimension."	es
We therefore agree with the report, just as we agree, Commissioner, with the basic principles of the White Paper. Since the Treaty came into force, Community competition law has been one of the fundamental chapters of Community policy. Now, some forty years after they came into force, those provisions have begun to show signs of weakness. It was therefore urgently necessary to proceed with modernisation, and this particularly in five areas. Firstly, the system for issuing authorisations; secondly, decentralisation in the application of the provisions; thirdly, procedural rules; fourthly, the application of those provisions in court; and fifthly and finally, excessive formalism. The system for issuing individual authorisations needed urgent reform, as requested in unison by businesses, experts in the field and specialist lawyers. I have never attended a meeting of competition law specialists where a change in the system was not requested. A system which offers so few decisions, whether authorising or prohibiting, as the one currently in force can be considered anything but a good system. For some time now, national competition authorities have had the power to apply Articles 81(1) and 82. However, they have not had the power to apply Article 81(3), which has to some extent prevented the consistent application of Article 81(1). At present, as the Honourable Members are aware, two preliminary questions are pending before the Court of Justice, submitted by two German courts, in which the national judge is wondering whether it is possible to apply Article 81(1) without being able to use Article 81(3). A reform of this aspect was therefore necessary. The procedure to be followed in competition matters is essentially contained in Regulation No 1762. The voices of those who called for its amendment were unanimous. This unanimity in requesting its reform was motivated by the fact that the regulation did not define a proper procedure, that it did not establish time limits, that it did not regulate access to documents by interested parties and that it did not adequately recognise the rights of defence. The Court of Justice has recognised for some time that Community competition law could be applied by national judges, and the Commission published a communication on the matter as early as 1994. It was therefore necessary to facilitate the practicability of this route. One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law concerns its excessive formalism. As a result of the continental legal tradition, the definition of a given agreement as being anti-competitive or not depends more on the analysis of its clauses than on its effects on the market. It was therefore necessary to introduce the concept of economic analysis. The White Paper aims to resolve all these problems and, therefore, we support its proposals. It is also true that we have not overlooked some shortcomings, which the report focuses on. Firstly, the fact that, while addressing the issue of modernising Articles 81 and 82, importance has been given only to Article 81, and not to Article 82. In the current phase, in which the processes of concentration of companies or privatisation of monopolies have left dominant positions intact, when they have not even strengthened them, prosecuting abuses of dominant positions becomes particularly important. Secondly, Regulation No. 1762 must be repealed and replaced by a new regulation. In these terms, we intend to support the report.	it
It is the Commission that is responsible for technical security against counterfeiting. As has already been pointed out, in the summer of 1998 the Commission presented a communication listing all the areas where measures are required, namely the area of information, the area of continuing education – an important point – the area of cooperation between the eurozone states and, of course, cooperation beyond this simple framework and in the area of criminal measures. This is what the framework decision before you is about. Madam Rapporteur, I would like to thank you most sincerely on behalf of the Commission and, above all, I also thank Parliament for being able to draw up an opinion in such a short time. I attach great importance to this. The framework decision refers to ensuring that the Member States use the definition of the offences of counterfeiting. Having the same definitions is obviously the essential condition for reacting in the same way everywhere, because, as has already been pointed out, the main aim is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically put into circulation. Of course, the Commission is also grateful to Parliament for taking its decision quickly - I hope that the text will be adopted just as quickly - which now allows the framework decision to enter into force as quickly as possible. This means that implementing measures can now be initiated. The Commission is now asked to submit, during the first half of next year, a report on the implementation of the framework decision in the Member States, so as to determine whether the importance of the issue is reflected in appropriate action. It has been pointed out that this framework decision falls precisely under criminal law. This innovation, this step forward, should therefore be acknowledged, even though Mr Schulz pointed out that, by supplementing this rather old convention, the step forward in question is rather timid. In response to the question of whether the Commission considers the Framework Decision to have a sufficiently solid legal basis in accordance with the Treaty, the Commission considers that the legal basis applied is correct. However, the Framework Decision will subsequently have to be supplemented by other legal acts. The Commission will propose a regulation on cooperation between all competent authorities and on cooperation with Europol. This proposal must provide for a duty of cooperation and must also oblige national authorities to report cases of counterfeiting to Europol and to submit seized counterfeit currency to the ECB for identification and classification, which will enable effective action to be taken in this area. As for the question of coordinating the various measures, since 1998 the Commission - and subsequently OLAF - has been working with experts from the Member States, the ECB and Europol to be able to combat euro counterfeiting effectively in advance. For its part, the Commission has already presented - as Mr Karas pointed out - a proposal for an information campaign on the euro, the proposed budget of which is 32 million euros. This is an amount that can be spent wisely, a substantial amount. This campaign will, of course, focus primarily on the security of the euro against counterfeiting.	fr
Therefore, any proposal suggesting a major reform of the competition policy enforcement system must be carefully considered. The truth is that the single market is not yet complete. During my six months as a Member of this Parliament, I have become fully aware of the determination of many Members to promote what is called the European project. We hear daily about the need to promote a broader and deeper Europe. However, in reality, all of this is rhetoric in view of the national, regional, and local obstacles that continue to hamper the functioning of a genuine European single market. It is in this context that I wish to assess the Commission's proposals. I would like to make it clear that we have the utmost confidence in Commissioner Monti and that we respect him deeply. We consider him the right man to dismantle the cartels. However, he must recognize, like everyone else, that his particular proposals need to be assessed and subjected to rigorous scrutiny, a job that has been done by our rapporteur from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr. von Wogau. I would like to congratulate him, unfortunately in his absence, on the exhaustive and thorough manner in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report—and also for putting up with me, a constant source of irritation! He mentioned earlier the fact that the report was adopted by a large majority but without my support. Although I do not share his conclusions, I believe that he has illustrated, in his report, many of the issues that the Commission needs to address. First, the possibility of renationalizing competition policy. I know that the Commission is not in favor of this, but the possibility exists. I remain concerned about the capacity of the national courts and competition authorities. I remain concerned about the whole operation concerning the judicial process. I asked Commissioner Monti a few days ago what would happen if he were wrong and renationalization actually took place. Mr. von Wogau said that we can turn to the European Court. Well, in Britain, that is what we are doing at the moment. We see that the European Court is unable to issue interim measures in relation to a certain dispute we are currently having with France, for which we have the support of the European Commission. Unless one considers this to be a purely nationalist argument, the European Court took 10 years to deliver a judgment in the Factortame case, in which the British government was the defendant. So, from a judicial point of view, action should be taken. I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area. As for legal certainty, I agree with the argument put forward by Mrs. Thyssen. It is important that companies enjoy legal certainty. I said this again to Mr. Monti recently. He said that we should not always be dragged along by lawyers.	fr
"Finally, it should be remembered that the real solution to the problems of comitology for the European Parliament lies, in any case and in principle, in amending the procedure laid down in the Treaty for implementing the rules and in the gradual abolition of committees, whose existence is an anomaly that severely limits the Commission's executive powers and risks undermining the European Parliament's legislative powers. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, comitology is a term that most people are unfamiliar with, and very few know what it means. It evokes images of secret societies and conspiracies, and so it was in the past too. What it really means is that it defines the procedures for exercising the executive powers conferred on the Commission. These executive powers consist of a limited number of committee procedures. Until the Treaty of Amsterdam, there were approximately 20 variations of these committee procedures, which contributed neither to the clarity of legislative implementation nor to transparency for citizens. On the contrary, even the European Parliament was not even informed for a long time. The first step forward in the fight for greater transparency in this committee jungle was for the European Parliament to at least be informed about everything the European Commission intended to regulate within these various committees. This happened in 1988 as part of the Plumb/Delors exchange of letters. A further step towards transparency and participation by the European Parliament was the so-called modus vivendi of September 20, 1994, in which Parliament was granted not only information but also a certain right of objection. This also gave Parliament oversight powers. The Treaty of Amsterdam significantly improved the situation in that the number of committee procedures was drastically limited to three – as the European Parliament had long demanded – namely the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure, and the advisory procedure. The information and oversight rights granted to the European Parliament in the past must now, under the Treaty of Amsterdam, be reaffirmed through an interinstitutional agreement. Our rapporteur, Ms. Frassoni, has done very careful work and identified which issues need to be clarified within the framework of this interinstitutional agreement and which administrative procedures within Parliament may need to be amended. A key problem is the time factor. When the European Parliament is informed, it must generally deliver its opinion within a very short period of four weeks if it so wishes. When it comes to issues affecting the health and safety of people in the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be able to respond very quickly, within a few hours or days if necessary. Nevertheless, the European Parliament's right to information and, if necessary, to respond must be preserved. Our rapporteur proposes very practical solutions to these difficulties, which my group and I can only fully support. I have just one more request. There is something misleading in the German text of paragraph 2, and I urgently request clarification, also later from those responsible for printing. In my opinion, instead of ""must be continued"" it should be ""must be preserved""."	de
This proposal stands in stark contrast to the current system, in which criminal law and criminal procedure, as the core of national legal systems, fall under the sovereignty of each people and the exclusive competence of each state. The idea of a European Public Prosecutor's Office, by contrast, aims to relegate states to a subordinate role in this area in the long term. Moreover, this proposal would entail an entirely unpredictable chain of reforms. According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor's Office would be necessary primarily to direct the investigations of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). At the same time, however, the Van Hulten report, which is being discussed today, reveals that the European Public Prosecutor's Office would itself be supervised by a European Union court. Thus, a small European reform can conceal a medium-sized reform, and a medium-sized reform can conceal a major reform. Moreover, a major reform can conceal a huge reform, because soon a European criminal law will be proposed, and why not a European Minister of Justice, who would be controlled by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament. In my opinion, we should therefore carefully consider the balance of powers that could be upset by proposing such a seemingly isolated reform. This ultimately shows that proposals such as the one for a European Public Prosecutor's Office reveal an inability to imagine Europe in any way other than pyramidal and centralized, that is, in the form of a superstate. The Europe of Nations Group, on the other hand, aspires to a polycentric Europe in which nations are interconnected. The outcome of such interconnection could conceivably be, for example, better coordination between national courts and perhaps the creation of national structures specializing in infringements detrimental to Community finances. The legal framework therefore already exists. It is sound in principle and only needs to be improved. Mr President, Mrs Theato is proposing an institutional revolution for two reasons. The public, indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of cows infected with mad cow disease, is supposedly alarmed by the fraud that supposedly endangers financial interests. And these two reasons are supposed to justify a dual set of instruments: a European penal code for violations of Community law and a European public prosecutor. Mrs Theato has probably forgotten to mention a European prison, since the FBI, the European police force, and even OLAF, already exist. The whole thing is to be regulated by two regulations, one for the public prosecutor, one for the penal code, to be adopted on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, that is to say, according to secondary law, because one of the special features of secondary law is that it permits all kinds of absurdity. We are dealing with a double absurdity here. First, there is the classic, Eurofederalist ideological absurdity: a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomacy, a single army, and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor's office. And all this to combat fraud amounting to less than a billion, while many times that amount is being thrown out the window for the GSP, free trade zones or tariff gifts to Chiquita, and billions more are being lost from the fourth source of revenue, GDP, as a result of the budget rationing pact.	de
And it could go on like this. Commissioner, since time is short, I would like to quickly list the seven points - you mentioned some - that we think are essential and that we should work on: the obligation, as soon as possible, to sail in our waters, to have a double hull; the strictest possible control by the port State. Furthermore, the classification societies must be obliged to make their reports public because they are not made public. Harmonisation of sanctions between the fifteen Member States because they must not differ but be the same everywhere. Greater severity for flags of convenience, not because the ships that fly these flags are necessarily bad ships but because many bad ships use these flags; improving information on all the fleets in the world but this is already foreseen; defining and making responsibilities more severe. In this regard, I would like to know who owns the Erika because the notion of legal person in our law is one thing but behind it there are always shareholders, natural persons; where are the owners of the Erika? Perhaps in beautiful villas, on beautiful beaches, sunbathing. We would like to know their names and faces. Finally, improved training for crews. There is no such thing as zero risk in our society, but at least we must take maximum precautions. Mr President, I appreciate the Commissioner's statement. I have spent a long time at sea and therefore know from experience its power and destructive force, which make the correct design and maintenance of ships and vessels a fundamental factor. I would like to express my solidarity with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the splitting in two and the sinking of the oil tanker Erika. This was an environmental disaster and also a deplorable waste of resources. I would like to remind you that the oil industry, through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPCF), under the 1969 Convention and the 1992 Protocol, assumes responsibility for more than 90 percent of the estimated costs of the accident, or approximately 170 million dollars. This leads me to believe that we should also consider partial assumption of responsibility by shipowners, the flag State and inspection authorities. However, before rushing into a new regulatory push, let us carefully examine the existing provisions to ensure that they are applied correctly: it is better to respond to the call to amend and improve existing legislation rather than embark on new proposals. In this sense, I support calls to strengthen port State controls to ensure full and effective inspections, as well as calls to ensure that classification societies actually check the structural condition of ships and are held accountable for their actions. The call for improved design in hull construction, especially of double-hulled ships, is reasonable but will take time to be implemented across the fleet.	it
The Serbs' large-scale expulsion campaign was halted, but almost every day there are unacceptable incidents where people are killed, where people are prevented from living there and living the way they want. There are daily attacks on Serbs, Roma, and Bosnians, but there are also still attacks on Albanians. I was actually shocked by the report, if it's true, that an Albanian doctor, who certainly worked under great difficulty in the hospital in Mitrovic in the Serbian part, ultimately gave up serving his people there because his life was repeatedly threatened. These are incidents and situations that we cannot tolerate. I hear—whether it's true or not, I don't know—that the Serbs are still operating a mine in Kosovo, in the Serbian part. There are at least rumors that Serbian militias are still active. For me, it is irrelevant whether it is a Serb, a Roma, a Bosnian, or an Albanian who is threatened or killed in Kosovo. It is irrelevant who is working toward a division and separation in Kosovo. What is crucial for me is that the institutions we fund achieve what we want to achieve: a multi-ethnic Kosovo, a coexistence in Kosovo. We need more police; there are absolutely not enough police. We need an independent judiciary—certainly difficult to establish—and we also need funding for the High Commissioner for Human Rights. All of this must happen, and quickly. If we do not provide assistance quickly, the situation will worsen, and new conflicts and crises may arise. Therefore, I believe it is right that we acted quickly, that we recognized urgency, and that we provided the money. But we want to see action, and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I ask the Commission to ensure that this money is used successfully, particularly to strengthen the police force and build up the judiciary. Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the Members of this House, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue. This will undoubtedly enable us to allocate funds to Kosovo promptly and counter the concerns expressed by both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack. In this evening's debate, I believe I have identified three main concerns. Firstly, although we have made considerable progress – we could mention customs administration, banking administration, tax administration – it is true that we must make further progress. Forward, to finance what? This is where we have our first small disagreement. In some of your amendments, you are calling for a more precise definition of the type of bodies to which the Union's financial contribution applies. For example, in Amendments 3 and 5. However, in our view, greater discretion should be given to the United Nations administration, which knows the reality on the ground better than we do. We believe that, at present, a pre-determination of the intended use of resources would create more practical difficulties.	de
"We must not forget that in 1999, 717,000 people came to compensate for our low birth rate. Therefore, a socially conscious immigration policy is absolutely essential in the social order, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain. Particular attention must be paid to the situation of those whose job opportunities are threatened or weakened by economic changes, mergers, acquisitions, new technologies, and so on. A training policy to train and prepare people for new jobs is essential in order to safeguard existing jobs or to give them a second chance. Because, as the film title suggests, the postman sometimes rings twice. I simply believe that it is the responsibility of all European, national, and regional governments to ensure that he rings more than once. I believe, Commissioner, that the Commission has a responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Andersson on his truly excellent work—which is why there is broad agreement—and thank the Members for their contributions. Allow me to make a few comments on what has already been said. First, I would like to emphasize that the debate on social protection between the European institutions began several years ago. In 1995, there was an initial communication entitled ""The Future of Social Protection,"" followed by reports from the European Parliament, Ms. Weiler, and Mr. Pronk. Today we are discussing Mr. Andersson's report. I believe we have made considerable progress, especially since we are now debating the modernization of social protection. Second, it is important to consider the legal basis on which the European Commission can act. As is well known, the Treaty does not provide a legal basis for policies at the European level, but there is an agreement, reaffirmed at the last Council, that measures should be initiated to coordinate and exchange experiences and successful programs among the Member States. Thirdly, I would like to point out that the four objectives on which this report focuses – paid work, the economic sustainability of pension systems, social inclusion and, finally, the quality of healthcare – take a horizontal approach to gender equality issues, since within each of the categories mentioned by the honourable Members, there are specific programmes aimed at women. It is often necessary to address the problems identified with specific policies. I would now like to turn to the concrete steps we have taken. As you know, the Portuguese Presidency has already set up a high-level working group, which will present its first report at the June Summit. The Portuguese Presidency will give priority to the two issues of long-term pension security and social inclusion. I believe that the proposal to set up a contact group at parliamentary level is very positive and, once this high-level working group has been approved, can help us make further progress. Several speakers have commented on the role of social protection systems, the costs of social protection, and the impact of these systems on the competitiveness of Member States. I would like to point out that policies are intended to link competitiveness and social cohesion in Europe."	de
CURRENT AND URGENT DEBATE The next item is the debate on current, urgent and particularly important issues. Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain) The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: B5-0149/2000 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on outbreaks of racism and xenophobia in the region of El Ejido (Spain); B5-0159/2000 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Sánchez García, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reformist Party, on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain); B5-0162/2000 by Mrs. Díez González and others, on behalf of the Group of European Socialists, on the racist and xenophobic outbreak in El Ejido (Almería); B5-0169/2000 by Mr. Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the xenophobic outbreak in El Ejido (Spain); B5-0175/2000 by Mr. Bautista Ojeda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain). Mr. President, I am reassured by this debate because I see that the first three speakers are well aware of the situation because we are of African origin. First of all, I would like to congratulate the groups in this Assembly for the high degree of consensus reached on this resolution, mindful as I am of the effort we Members of this Parliament have made to avoid using an issue like this for electoral purposes. Secondly, I would also like to firmly state that neither Spain nor Andalusia are xenophobic or racist, which does not, of course, exclude the absolute condemnation of the use of violence by those who, individually or in groups, deserve only the law and only the law to pursue them rigorously and firmly. We must address the issue of immigration in depth and with rigor. The facts, which unfortunately precede political decisions in this area, undoubtedly confirm the priority of implementing the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the Treaty without delay. Today's problems cannot be resolved within five years. That is a long time, as we are seeing. The legislation of the Member States must be adapted to the governments' agreements reached in Tampere, as the resolution itself states in its paragraph 7. The social integration of legal immigrants must be carried out without any excuses and without any delay. Furthermore, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the labor market must be realistically regulated so that jobs filled by third-country nationals are subject to labor regulations that guarantee equal wages, social security, and social coverage, thereby eradicating labor exploitation and the pockets of marginalized citizens that give rise to the acts condemned in the resolution and that, ultimately, are the real background of the social problem raised there. Furthermore, solidarity, dialogue, and agreements between institutions—including European ones—at national, regional, and local levels, with employers, unions, and the immigrant communities themselves, whose countries of origin also bear undoubted responsibility, are fundamental.	es
In the context of the next IGC resolution, Parliament will have to seriously consider the issue of differentiation and flexibility. Both enlargement and the results of integration are threatened if we are unable to create the system of concentric circles proposed by the Liberal Group. My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta, have already expressed themselves, not without some skepticism, on certain aspects of the issue at hand. I would like to express my concerns about subsidiarity, not only between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Member States and their own autonomous regions. This subject has not received adequate attention, and there are many elements of concern. Allow me to draw particular attention to one of the implications of enlargement for this Parliament. It has been decided that Parliament could not reasonably have more than 700 Members if it was to remain a deliberative assembly. If we apply the current principle of degressive proportionality, namely six seats per Member State plus one seat per half a million inhabitants, we already arrive at a situation where Luxembourg, with its 367,000 inhabitants, has more Members of this House than Wales, which is a partially autonomous region of the United Kingdom. Scotland, with a population of five million, currently has eight seats in this House; Denmark and Finland have 16, for the same number of inhabitants. Now, what will happen if we keep the maximum number of Members of the European Parliament at 700, gradually include 26% more population, and then adopt the Commission's proposal—which I consider ill-considered—that we should have a European list of candidates. What will happen to a region like Scotland, which I represent here? It will become totally invisible! In these circumstances, Members of this House should not be in the least surprised that the people of Scotland and other similar countries are asking, in these discussions, whether enlargement should not also consist of the admission of new Member States from existing ones. This view is increasingly widespread in Scotland. Mr President, if I say that the Union is at a crossroads, I will not be announcing anything new at all. This has been said many times. But this time it is true: we have launched the single currency, an extremely positive element, and we are considering enlargement. The question remains whether we will be ready when enlargement comes or not. Are we going to enlarge without deepening, or are we going to enlarge while deepening? That is the debate, and that is what any discussion on the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda, and its method will be about. It is clear that, for the time being, the Council has not opted for enlargement accompanied by deepening. This is dangerous for enlargement, dangerous for any prospect of political union and, above all, difficult for public opinion to understand. The Council must understand that if we want the future of the European Union to be based on sound enlargement, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further.	fr
You referred to Article 11(1), which stipulates that the Funds' appropriations cannot replace public or equivalent structural expenditure by the Member State. Very well: that is the immutable rule. Could Article 11(1) authorise the following practice? Suppose that the funding of a self-governing region or a country under the Structural Funds increases, then the State could reduce the central funding allocated to that region proportionately, so that the total package of funding available corresponds to a formula set at national level, irrespective of the amount of Structural Funds provided by the Union. Is such a practice really permissible? Additionality is also an important issue for Wales, which I represent. Last week, it was even one of the reasons for a vote of no confidence and the resignation of the First Secretary of the National Assembly for Wales. It was only in 1991-1992 that the Commission won a battle with the United Kingdom over additionality, then in the context of the RECHAR funds. This led to the signing of an agreement in which the British Government agreed to introduce procedures to ensure that Community funds reached the areas for which they were intended and were genuinely additional. Despite this, problems persist in Wales and Scotland. Could the Commission look into this particular situation in relation to the agreement with the British Government? I gather, Madam, that the debate which I understand is taking place in Scotland is also taking place in Wales. I will check what you say and if you agree, I will also answer your question in writing, as I promised Mr MacCormick. I will try to give a brief answer, Mr President, by telling the honourable Member that the regional development plan presented by the Spanish authorities on 29 October does not allow me to conclude that there has been a distribution of Community resources between the Spanish regions of Objective 1 - because that is what it is about in Andalusia - and therefore of those destined for the region you represent. You should know, honourable Member, that since I was unable to understand exactly how things stood, on 14 December I wrote a letter, which I have here with me, to the Minister of Economy and Finance, Rato, to ask for additional information on the document presented. In the coming weeks, the Commission will begin negotiations with the Spanish authorities to draw up the Community support framework for the new period 2000-2006 and during these meetings I assure you that the Commission will obtain the necessary clarifications on the distribution region by region. On the subject of Andalusia, if you like, as soon as I have the data by sector and region, I will hasten to communicate them to you personally. Commissioner, the problem is that when Aznar has to collect funds from the European Union for Andalusia, he counts all the Andalusians, but when Aznar has to pay the Andalusian government in the form of services for all Andalusians, he no longer sees 400,000 Andalusians and this is very serious because 400,000 children are like the entire population of Strasbourg or a city larger than Granada, full of children that Aznar does not see.	it
The text of the proposed regulation was amended quite substantially in the Committee on Fisheries. All members of our group voted in favor of these amendments in committee and in plenary. Amendment 1 makes the text considerably clearer. The data collected is not intended solely for scientific purposes. It must be processed by scientists and then forwarded to the political bodies responsible for making decisions. However, it is of utmost importance that the collection be based on scientific evidence. Amendment 2 contains a modification of the Commission's original proposal. The Commission's proposal requires the preparation of very detailed studies for each individual vessel and each individual company. In addition to the extraordinary cost burden that such a proposal would entail, the cumbersome implementation procedures could also lead certain administrations to use these difficulties as an excuse for not providing the relevant information on time. There is also a risk that additional bureaucratic requirements in this sector could create mistrust among those affected. Regarding the second part of this amendment, it is necessary to identify and quantify job losses in this sector much more precisely. It should not be forgotten that the implementation of a Common Fisheries Policy must also include a social dimension in statistical and analytical terms. Amendment 3 makes it possible to take into account the important aspect of collecting environmental data. The particularly negative impact of failing to take such data into account is clearly evident, for example, in the decision to ban driftnets, which is not at all ecologically justified, as they are one of the most selective fishing gears. If this ecological dimension were not included in the data collection, the Commission could prohibit the use of any particular fishing gear at will. Amendment 4 requires scientists to process all data and present it to the competent authorities, including national and regional authorities, in a way that is useful for decision-making. Amendment 5 reduces the burdens contained in the Commission's proposal. For example, the competent authorities may only request information that improves operational knowledge of fishing activities, without requiring the disclosure of data protected by the right of confidentiality, such as tax information that does not fall within the Community's competence. Amendment 6 makes this article more binding by involving the Commission in the procedure and monitoring it. All data must be transmitted annually and the Commission regularly informed of the aggregated results. Finally, Amendment 7 requires the Commission to submit a report by the end of 2001. Since the Common Fisheries Policy is due to be revised in 2002, all policymakers must have access to the information that forms the basis of the Commission's proposal. Hudghton report (A5-0036/2000) The amendment to the directive presented by the Commission is important because it deals with a specific contagious viral disease, infectious salmon anaemia. It is transmitted in water via organic substances such as blood, feces, mucus, etc. Vertical transmission of the disease through spawn or milk has not been scientifically proven. However, it is known that other species such as trout, eels, or herring can carry the virus without becoming ill.	de
"We therefore believe that a more realistic deadline should be found in the conciliation procedure. We voted against Amendments 25 and 72, which call for minimal anthropogenic pollution of all groundwater. We consider this requirement unrealistic, given the immense costs and extremely long timescales required to restore a virtually unpolluted state. This is the reason for our vote. Water is a renewable and limited natural resource, the wise use of which is essential. The Water Framework Directive will represent an important cornerstone of Community policy in this sector. The objectives of this directive are clear and ambitious. We agree with these objectives. The directive sets environmental limit values close to zero. However, we believe it would be more sensible not to set unrealistic deadlines that neither our Member States nor our industry can meet. Of course, we need a timetable, but it must be more gradual. A legal obligation to achieve zero emissions and to stop discharges by 2020 would amount to a ban on all identified substances. Such provisions could pose major problems for cross-border river basins and, with regard to the candidate countries, could complicate enlargement. Naturally, I would also like to mention a particular sector whose developments I am following very closely: agriculture, which is one of the largest consumers of water. It must accept – and is already beginning to do so – its role as a paying polluter, but at the same time, its specific characteristics and constraints must also be taken into account, particularly in the arid regions of the world. Regarding the amendments concerning radioactive substances, I am naturally in favor of controls, but this question depends on the legal basis established by the Euratom Treaty. Andersson report (A5-0033/2000). The EDD Group was unable to support the Andersson report. The explanatory memorandum (page 15) recognizes, among other things, that ""the different levels of development and traditions of the Member States in the area of social security prevent uniform harmonization of social security systems in the Member States."" However, the term ""uniform harmonization"" is one of those confusing terms that completely obscures the integration process in question. It is also correct, as the explanatory memorandum states, that harmonization is harmful: ""Harmonization would also be harmful because it would place greater demands on weaker Member States and, at the same time, could put more socially developed states under competitive pressure to make cuts in their social security systems. Such harmonization would benefit no one."" In reality, a social model is being introduced that amounts to harmonization—and uniform harmonization at that. Point D emphasizes that ""the Union can add value by adopting genuine, binding and effective convergence criteria."" The report then goes on to point out that the development of this convergence process will be promoted through consultations between the Ecofin Council and the Council of Social Affairs and Employment Ministers. Finally, point 7 emphasizes that ""the social convergence process must be accompanied by effective and ambitious fiscal coordination."" This brings us to the heart of the matter. This social harmonization project is not social policy; rather, it is a continuation of the EU's EMU project."	de
(The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. for a formal sitting to mark the visit of Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic, and resumed at 12.50 p.m.) Votes (continued) The next item was the vote on the report by Mrs Stenzel on the Equal initiative (A5-0034/2000). (Parliament adopted the motion for a resolution) Recommendation for second reading: Report (A5-0027/2000) by Mrs Lienemann, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067(COD)) Before the vote: I welcome the quality and ambition of this report on LIFE. I should just like to point out that LIFE is a financial instrument at the service of environmental policies within the European Union and in third countries, both in the neighbouring Mediterranean countries and in the countries bordering the Baltic Sea and in candidate countries. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tabled a large number of amendments, most of which were incorporated into the common position adopted by the Council. In the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004), this instrument is divided into three priority areas: LIFE-Nature (47% of resources), LIFE-Environment (47%), and LIFE-Third Countries (6%). These are, in my view, the most important changes: LIFE's contribution to sustainable development within the Community and to the development of Community environmental policy, particularly as regards the integration of the environment into other policies, and the implementation and revision of environmental legislation; improving the efficiency, transparency, and methodology of LIFE's implementation procedures, the procedures for informing and disseminating information to the public, and the procedures for cooperation between beneficiaries; LIFE's objective: this programme should aim primarily at sustainable urban development, in close coordination with the pilot projects implemented under the URBAN initiative, on which I have already had the opportunity to report; and the contribution of the projects supported to the sustainability of socio-economic measures and, consequently, to job creation. I consider it essential that the LIFE financial instrument continue to allow the participation of the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The other candidate countries (such as Cyprus, Turkey, and Malta) will also be able to participate in LIFE once appropriate agreements have been concluded with those countries. The main problem in the negotiations with the Council is, of course, the overall amount earmarked for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004). The Commission's proposal, approved by the Council, is EUR 613 million, while the Committee on the Environment considers that the corresponding budget should be EUR 850 million. I support the rapporteur's firm stance. The financial envelope in question has not been increased since the programme was launched, not even with the EU's enlargement to 15 Member States. If the report is adopted in plenary, a conciliation procedure must be initiated, as provided for in the codecision procedure, to resolve the issue of the funding allocated to this program. This type of procedure is common practice, as programs or legislative proposals all too often have budgets that fall far short of what they require!	de
So far, the Commission has had only limited success in reimbursing unjustly received funds. Criminal measures are the responsibility of the Member States. Given that these two legal aspects currently often overlap and that attacks on the EU budget are increasing cross-border—and are also perpetrated by organized crime—the division of competences between the Member States is unclear. Added to this are differences between national legal provisions and requests for mutual legal assistance that drag on or go unanswered. The Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests, signed by the European Council in 1995, and the two protocols thereto, have not changed this. To enter into force, this Convention must be ratified by all fifteen Member States. After five years, only four have done so. This inaction, which threatens to undermine the Union's credibility, has led Parliament to call for the creation of a European Public Prosecutor's Office. In doing so, there is no question of creating a transnational criminal and judicial system. Rather, the objective is to provide the Union with specific instruments to protect its financial interests, while respecting subsidiarity. With this report, we revive this idea and urge the Commission to submit legislative proposals to achieve this objective. In this regard, the requests emerging from the opinions of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are fully taken into account. We express two recommendations that stem from the creation of OLAF and should guarantee its operational and legal effectiveness, its transparency, and the protection of individual freedoms. To this end, we need - the first recommendation - a legal act that establishes the crimes against the Union's financial interests and the guiding principles. In a proposed amendment, I recommend setting 30 September as the deadline by which the Commission must put forward its proposal. The second recommendation concerns criminal procedure. The Commission should propose - and here too I propose by way of amendment setting the deadline for 31 May 2000 - a legal act on the creation of an independent body, linked to the Commission at institutional level, and responsible for coordinating and monitoring the regularity of OLAF's investigative activities. The existing Supervisory Committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the Office. Such a proposal should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are limited to OLAF's internal investigations and prosecutions in matters affecting the Union's financial interests and its relations with national authorities. It remains out of bounds to influence the justice system within the Member States. The control of the legality of acts must be ensured by the Court of Justice. Furthermore, we call on the next Intergovernmental Conference to begin the debate on the creation of a European Public Prosecutor's Office responsible for the protection of the Union's financial interests, if possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study produced by renowned specialists, the famous Corpus Juris, as well as the feasibility studies that followed it.	fr
These disasters are in fact due to major climate changes to which we are not uninvolved, because they are caused by human activities, especially those of developed countries. The greenhouse effect and deforestation also have significant consequences. As regards this regulation on the environmental dimension in the development process of developing countries, the Council has largely followed the amendments that we tabled and voted on at first reading. From this point of view, we can only be satisfied. However, I would like to stress one aspect that the Council has avoided - inadvertently, at least so I believe and hope - even though it is a fundamental issue: coordination between European actors and local interlocutors, namely local NGOs, basic communities and holders of traditional knowledge on the use of biological diversity. No project can be truly effective if it is not carried out in close cooperation with the population concerned. A final remark: if the creation of the steering committees is to be successful, I believe it will be necessary to reaffirm the desire to create a system of appeal open to civil society in developing countries for any measure that goes against legitimate social concerns. Mr President, the only key to the development of developing countries is their direct participation in this process, both in identifying problems and in solving them. As someone who has been involved in development cooperation work, I have noticed that in recent years this approach has succeeded, to some extent, in replacing the old paternalistic ideology, according to which industrialised countries think that development consists in transferring their standard of living to the most backward nations. The new paradigm of development cooperation stresses the importance of partnership and the ability of those who provide aid to listen to each other. In fact, it is necessary to be patient and to give the beneficiaries the opportunity to identify their problems themselves, draw up a development plan and carry it through. Those who provide help must ensure that they do not become indispensable and that the work creates local prosperity and activity. In this respect, Mr Wijkman has produced an excellent report, which highlights the importance of this paradigm as a valid and morally sustainable alternative. Unfortunately, at EU level, scientific and technological development projects for developing countries do not follow this approach at all. The European Union's framework programmes do not cover developing countries. In practice, environmental scientific and technological development projects cannot involve partners from, for example, North Africa. Of course, there is no stopping them from carrying out research: the problem is that there is no money. This is because developing countries cannot participate as partners in the consortia that apply for funding. Why? When you consider that Eastern European countries have been given more opportunities to participate, it becomes even stranger. Furthermore, the issues that concern us most closely are, for example, the desertification of North Africa and the problems affecting the Mediterranean basin.	it
First, indirect tax provisions; recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, direct provisions and, in particular, the code of good conduct. This system has worked quite well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca, time passes and it is necessary to adapt the regulation we have applied until now to the new circumstances. In this regard, I noted a significant consensus in all the interventions. First, it is necessary to define clear and comprehensive standards at the level of drafting the regulation. The existence of confusing rules, regulatory gaps, or rules that only enshrine indeterminate legal concepts is probably more shocking in this part of the regulation than in others. This is all the more shocking, as is the case in the second part of the reform, where the application of the ordinance to national authorities is recommended. Third, the role that the Commission must play against the temptation to create independent agencies that would distort the very essence of the Commission in order to ensure uniform application by international organizations seems important to me. Fourthly, and I will conclude with this, as some speakers have already alluded to, the international legal order has changed. We saw this at the aborted Seattle conference and we see it in our bilateral conferences with various regions or countries around the world. The principle of competition must already be applied universally. And we must ensure that environmental and labour standards are respected in order to avoid dumping in this sector, that property rights are scrupulously respected, that state aid is reviewed, because, as has been said in this House, it distorts competition in many sectors and destroys jobs within the Union and, finally, that equal conditions are applied to prevent aid and internal distortions in other countries from ultimately spreading to international level through traps. Mr President, Commissioner, the Jonckheer report contains many good ideas on state aid to industry and several other sectors. First of all, it demonstrates Parliament's resolve to impose a reduction in state aid in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market. However, several of the conclusions still give rise to serious concerns within our group. For example, the fact that the reduced amounts and levels of state aid vary greatly from one Member State to another demonstrates the usefulness of such reviews. Aid stemming from selfish national concerns gives companies unjustified advantages, distorts competition, and leads to an inefficient and unprofitable distribution of scarce resources at European level. This is no longer the same thing at all; we are dealing here with atypical forms of aid. We must promote forms of state aid that require efforts on the part of the recipients. I am thinking in particular of state guarantees, on which the Commission recently adopted a position. They must obviously be considered state aid, but in my opinion they are a better solution than direct aid. The report on competition policy highlights the Commission's confidence in strict legislation rather than insisting on economic arguments that interfere with competitiveness.	fr
"I believe that there are circumstances where the question of principles and institutional rules fades into the background. I encourage the Council and its Presidency to continue to defend the fundamental values of the Union. I call on the Commission to be less cautious. With this resolution, our Parliament is assuming its responsibilities. That said, in my view, the resolution adopted today is a bare minimum, the least we could do. Personally, I defended an even firmer position and supported Amendments 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral amendment proposed by the Socialist Group. I believe it is imperative that the Council only accept technical relations with representatives of the Austrian government, which include members of the FPÖ. Involving Jörg Haider's party in a government coalition will trivialise the far right in Europe, and constitutes an extremely serious precedent that could have significant knock-on effects in other members of the Union or in the candidate countries. The Austrian Conservative Party is taking on a historic responsibility here. Our fundamental values are at stake here: as democratically elected representatives of the European people, we have no choice. We must, as our voters demand, reject the unacceptable. Because when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces, ""Not to oppose is already to surrender."" I abstained from voting on the resolution. I condemn Jörg Haider's racist and xenophobic line. However, I cannot approve of an EU body intervening politically in the domestic politics of a Member State. That said, I cannot approve of paragraph 4 of the joint resolution and I cannot vote in favor of the resolution, even against the extreme right. (SV) It is obvious that Europe's political leaders have the right and the duty to react against Haider and his party. Europe's political leaders have the right to express their opinion on the political developments of another Member State, just as a Minister of State can speak out against racist politicians in a local authority. Finland's experience, however, shows that integration is a better way to combat anti-democratic forces than isolation. This is why I voted against point 2 of the resolution. This, however, presupposes that all parties respect human rights. The EU Presidency's ""joint reaction"" to the formation of the government in Austria is legally incorrect. The reaction of the 14 Member States lacks support in the Treaty. We must also not isolate forces in Austria that want to work to defend human rights. Despite my objection to the Council's approach and my view that it would be better to work for integration rather than isolation, it was essential to clearly demonstrate the European Parliament's position on issues of racism, which is why I voted for the resolution in the final vote. This concludes voting time. Adjournment of the session"	fr
Of course, progress could possibly be made if agreement on this issue could be reached at the Intergovernmental Conference. It remains to be seen whether there is a consensus. After that, we will see. For our part, we will take note of the proposals on this subject. Mr President, I join with the previous speakers in wishing Portugal a successful Presidency. You said that this particular issue is not currently on your agenda for the next Intergovernmental Conference, but if it were desired, you would consider it. Well, I and my 35 British Conservative colleagues in the European Parliament would like to ask you to do so. I realize that this is a provocative question. It is intended to be provocative, because it concerns a serious matter: some countries do not respect EU law as they should. We must find a way to force such countries to comply with the rules so that we can regain the trust of our citizens. I can't think of a better way of achieving this. Do you have a better suggestion? The issue here is whether the European dimension is strengthened or lessened, particularly through its inclusion in the Treaties. You will understand that this issue must be examined within the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it is one of the issues on which only a special European Council summit can authorize the Portuguese Presidency to pursue it further, because it is one of the issues that lies outside the institutional framework in which the next Intergovernmental Conference will be held. Intergovernmental conferences are something of an event, and they can also be something like a Christmas tree. Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that these issues, which have repeatedly arisen and been passed from one conference to the next, will be raised again. The problem is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union to take up this issue again, bearing in mind, above all, that if such an issue is included, other, similar issues will probably also be added to the Conference's agenda. Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor on a point of order. Please be brief. Mr President, I realize I must hurry. I really liked what Mr Seixas da Costa said about Santa Claus. In Spain, they talk about the letter to the Three Wise Men. I would simply like to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent the letter with its reports to the Three Wise Men. Now it is up to the Presidency and the Council to deliver the gifts we requested in our letter to the Three Wise Men. As I suspected, it was not, strictly speaking, a point of order but a way of winding up the debate. We thank Mr Seixas da Costa, but he too can write a letter to the Three Wise Men. I would just like to say that this question of Christmas customs, which the honourable Member has raised, is extremely important. The only difference is that in this case, Santa Claus has someone who rules over him, and that is why Santa Claus can only give gifts if they have someone else's approval.	de
"However, much remains to be done. The next major challenge is to relaunch the new round of world trade negotiations, which failed to get off the ground last December in Seattle. It must be a ""development round,"" in which developing countries, which were effectively excluded from previous rounds, are fully represented. Because the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves. Developing countries want trade, not aid; a little boost, but not a handout. And the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open the world's markets to allow them to sell their products. In this way, the power of globalization can be harnessed for good, for the benefit of the poor and not just the rich, the majority and not a minority. Therefore, whether through the ""New Deal"" in Newcastle or fair trade in Freetown, Labour's objective of giving everyone a chance remains the same. Swoboda Report (A5-0031/2000). (FR) The Commission's desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and to open up the prospect of full integration into the Community for the latter, appears to respond to a priority concern: the construction of a political entity that respects nations and their sovereignty could not postpone for much longer the sending of a signal to these southeastern European states, toward which, since the end of the Second World War, history has not been kind. After having been crushed by the boot of triumphant communism, the region has continued to pay the price of the Soviet collapse since the early 1990s. However, in this difficult context, and particularly since NATO's military intervention in the Balkans, some of these states, all of them truly European, have demonstrated a sense of responsibility that legitimizes their aspirations for integration into the Community. In this sense, the case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both exemplary and emblematic. Exemplary because it demonstrates that the Balkan states are not beset by any kind of fate and that those countries willing to do so are now in a position to meet the usual requirements of the stabilization and association agreements required by the European Union. Emblematic because it positively illustrates the Fifteen's vision of the emergence of a common policy for the five countries of the region (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM, and Albania) capable of making economic and political stabilization a vital and urgent obligation. The UEN Group agrees to send this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, insofar as it prioritizes the independence and sovereignty of states: while a satisfactory solution cannot be found in the Balkans without a significant policy of cooperation between the member states, its integration process cannot be blocked on the grounds that one of its countries would be deemed unworthy of this promotion. The Union is fulfilling its role by seeking, through its cooperation policy, to encourage nations to embrace a foundation of common values, the cornerstone of which is democracy and the freedom of its citizens."	es
As a representative of the Commission, I will ensure that the Charter and the actions it gives rise to represent the affirmation of a Union based on the set of fundamental rights, which are an integral part of Europe's common heritage. Only in this way can we help to re-legitimize in the eyes of European citizens, without exception, the project of an enlarged Union, based on respect for rights and freedoms, on the guarantee of personal safety and property and on effective legal protection, in other words a Union based on the political values that characterise contemporary democracies. I would also like to point out that 1999 was the year in which the 1999-2004 legislature of the European Parliament came into office, of the new Commission and, consequently, of the entry into office of a Commissioner responsible exclusively for the areas of justice and home affairs. In addition to these events, I would like to remind Parliament of some of the matters approved in 1999. In the area of immigration, borders and asylum, the Commission presented the proposal for a regulation to establish the EURODAC database and the proposal for a directive on the conditions of admission of third-country nationals to the Member States of the Union for the purpose of family reunification - as part of a specific integration policy for those legally residing in the territory of the Union. We examined a communication on common asylum procedures and a recommendation authorising the Commission to negotiate an agreement with Iceland and Norway to extend to these two countries the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention. The Commission contributed actively to the work of the High Level Group on Migration and Asylum and, finally, in December, it presented a proposal for the creation of the European Refugee Fund. In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission has presented proposals for regulations aimed at the communitarisation of certain conventions: one on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I); another on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters (Brussels II) and yet another on the summons and notification of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters. We also presented, in 1999, a communication on victims of crime within the Union, initiating a debate which received further impetus at Tampere and which calls for the development of minimum standards on the protection of victims of crime, in particular as regards access to justice and the right to compensation for damages, including legal costs. I would also mention the presentation of the motion for a resolution on combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment. As part of the Union's legislative framework for combating financial crime, the Commission has presented a proposal for a revision of the Money Laundering Directive. In 1999, we saw the entry into operation of Europol and the Commission, for its part, sincerely hopes, following what the Portuguese Presidency has said here today, that with the entry into this new phase of the justice and home affairs sectors and the start of the reflection on the implementation of the new powers conferred on Europol by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the issue of democratic control and coordination between Europol and the competent judicial bodies, namely Eurojust, will also be addressed.	it
These two proposals make a significant contribution to implementing one of the four core principles of the internal market: the freedom to provide services. There is no doubt that the new regulation on the cross-border provision of services will improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and efficiency of businesses. The strict conditions for issuing the EU services card—and I second my colleague Wieland on this point—are essential because they prevent crimes such as illegal immigration and fictitious contracts. Why do I consider this directive so essential? For three reasons: the economic importance of third-country labour within the EU, the competitiveness of businesses, and the proper functioning of the internal market. I therefore welcome, on the one hand, the establishment of a strict framework and, on the other, call for the controls carried out by the Member States to be organized in the most efficient and simple way possible. In conclusion, I would like to ask the Commission the following question, as I am regularly challenged on this subject: will the directive harm the accession negotiations? How do you interpret Article 1, given that it plays an important role for our country, which borders many of the new states, and in the accession negotiations? Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, until now, businessmen have had to find that two of the important freedoms, namely the free movement of persons and services, did not apply to them. Indeed, they still had to submit to bureaucratic and interminable immigration procedures imposed by the Member States in which a service was to be performed. Around 13 million third-country nationals reside in European territory. Although the exact number of businessmen among them is not known, I assume that their number is certainly not small. Until now, their access to the entire territory of the Union was therefore not governed by Community law. The two proposals for directives under consideration aim to promote the free movement of services within the internal market through the introduction of the EU services card. In this regard, I believe it is important to emphasize that the issue of this services card will be flexible, namely within five days following a simple notification to the Member State in which the service will be provided, and that, moreover, this document will have a limited period of validity and will not be renewed automatically in order to combat abuse. I have also carefully noted the reservations expressed by the Commissioner. After examining the amendments introduced, I have noted that we can largely endorse these reservations and we will conduct ourselves accordingly in tomorrow's vote. In conclusion, allow me to thank Mrs Berger for the great care with which she examined the various amendments and, in doing so, the important significance she has given to her report.	fr
We also reject the amendments which seek to include the full cost of water by 2010. There is no doubt that we need to set water prices which encourage efficient use. However, at the same time, they must ensure the competitiveness of the productive sectors in the most disadvantaged regions without hindering their legitimate development. Finally, I would like to make a comment on the amendments relating to dangerous substances. These amendments establish that the objective to be achieved is a level of pollution equal to zero, or close to zero. However, I would like to point out that the level of zero pollution from any human activity has not yet been discovered. Ladies and gentlemen, we would be doing a disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we were not capable of giving it the flexibility and adaptability needed to ensure its application. I hope that, once again, Parliament will vote with a sense of reality, respecting the principle of subsidiarity and pursuing a fair balance between environmental objectives and economic and social considerations, the three essential elements for achieving the sustainable development that we all strongly desire. Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this is an extremely important directive, as its objective is to improve the supply and quality of water. Citizens must certainly have the right to have clean water. It is important not only for the environment, but also for the health of the population. I am not speaking in a personal capacity, in fact I can say that I am part of that small group of Europeans who can still draw drinking water directly from the lake in front of their house. Our task is to commit ourselves to adopting all the necessary measures that can guarantee the improvement of water quality, and this work must begin immediately because there is no more time to lose. It is also important to set objectives that are sufficiently ambitious. Indeed, thinking of eliminating the direct discharge of effluents into waters and reducing the quantity of impurities and poisonous substances to zero by 2002 is not at all ambitious, on the contrary. It is simply a question of doing what is technically possible; no more, no less. Nevertheless, we must also have ambition. I would like to return to a point that has already been discussed. In my opinion, the Committee on the Environment has limited the issue of water transfer too much. This problem does not only concern Spain, but also the Nordic countries and I really hope that more room will be given to national solutions, provided that they are ecologically and economically better than those provided for in the directive. Mr President, Commissioner, congratulations to Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work she has done! Water and air surround us everywhere and we share them with all the inhabitants of the planet. Water is an indispensable condition for human life and there are more and more human beings in the world. Mrs Schleicher said during the day that it would be unrealistic to aim for clean water. Nothing could be more wrong! What is unrealistic is to continue to worsen the quality of water, to continue to worsen the conditions that make life possible.	it
It is an instrument that does not always lead to optimal solutions. The rudiments of economics teach us that the market is flawed in many respects, and anyone who denies this is nothing more than an ideologue. Competition should bring about a balance between supply and demand, ensuring an optimal distribution of resources and economic facts. However, optimal efficiency does not necessarily follow automatically. To prevent abuse, a general framework is essential, for example through antitrust law. But, for the most part, this only serves to prevent abuse and is not sufficient, in itself, to achieve socially legitimate objectives. Competition: yes. Limiting aid: where necessary and possible. But, given that aid occupies the bulk of the 1998 competition report, I would still like to say a few words about it, without prejudice to the report by our colleague Mr. Jonckheer. Aid for small and medium-sized enterprises in the research and development sector and for training in regional and environmental policy are undoubtedly conceivable and must be feasible. As long as they do not lead to unacceptable distortions of competition, aid aimed at such objectives must be permitted. The fact that decisions taken in these specific areas can be implemented is even more important than it is for antitrust and merger law. Aid must not simply be pilloried: it must be considered in a differentiated manner; it must also be assessed in terms of its contribution to achieving the aforementioned objectives. This last remark was addressed less to the Commission than to our colleagues in the EPP Group. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report I have the opportunity to present to you today is an opinion on the Commission's annual report on State aid measures in force within the European Union and for which the Community has competence under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties. The Commission's report is essentially descriptive in nature, describing the development of State aid in the manufacturing sector and in other sectors, according to various typologies, such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued. I would like to refer to the explanatory memorandum for the quantitative part of the report and will simply state here that the average annual amount for the period under review is around EUR 95 billion, which represents a decrease of around 13% compared with the period 1993-1995, a decrease which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany. In short, the level of State aid declared is, broadly speaking, stable on average during the period covered and stands at around 1.2% of Community GDP, which is, coincidentally, more or less the equivalent of the Community budget for one year.	fr
What happens when more women participate actively and equally in political decision-making? Based on developments so far, one can say that the agenda has changed—and when the agenda changes, the nature of decisions naturally changes as well. Whenever quotas are mentioned, the word competence is automatically mentioned. What is interesting, however, is that the competence requirements are rarely defined. Instead, it often appears as if men today, just as in the past, always possess the highest, undefined competence. Being a man is therefore synonymous with being the most competent. I consider this view to be proof of the tremendous incompetence of many of today's decision-makers. At the beginning of this year, in this plenary session, we called for March 8 to be declared an international holiday. Pending a positive decision on this issue, I would now like to take this opportunity to wish all social democratic women every success in the Women's World Marches, which begin in the spring on International Women's Day. This global campaign aims to draw attention to violence against women and the poverty of women around the world. Finally, I would like to underline what Commissioner Patten said at the end of the previous debate: the ideal police officer would be a Black grandmother. We don't have that yet, but they exist! Mr. President, the position of women in politics is an important issue that deserves more attention than this politically correct bickering we are currently witnessing. Undoubtedly, too few women are involved in politics. This is certainly not solely due to the male dominance of party apparatuses. In France, 95% of MPs are local politicians. Most of them do not belong to any party. In the leading bodies at the departmental level, independent MPs, other right-wing or other left-wing, constitute the largest group. To be elected as a local politician, one simply has to stand as a candidate. Access to national responsibilities often depends on the opportunities for influence that such mandates open up. Our group advocates for equal representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union. Therefore, we oppose quota policies and positive discrimination, whether in favor of women or so-called social minorities. Minority policies, which establish superficial classifications in disregard of the profound unity of the human community, dangerously threaten the cohesion of the social fabric and the balance of our democratic model. First, if we establish quotas for women, why not also quotas based on age or ethnicity, quotas for Catholics, workers, and people who wear glasses? The introduction of social quotas in favor of the lowest-income categories would be no more idiotic than the creation of quotas for women. With such a philosophy, there would be no need to hold elections or advertise administrative positions. It would be sufficient to calculate the composition of ministries and parliaments statistically. Quota policies would only increase voters' disenchantment with politics by giving them, once again, the feeling that everything is happening behind their backs. On the other hand, such a policy is a sign of deep contempt for women.	de
In the environmental field, investments and objectives must be long-term. The future of future generations depends on it. Mr President, Commissioner, I will no doubt repeat what my colleagues have already said, but I believe the Council must be told time and again what we think of LIFE. I will therefore also emphasize – as the rapporteur has quite rightly done – that LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the development and implementation of the European Union's environmental policy. This instrument is of fundamental importance because it provides the impetus for truly innovative measures in favor of nature and the environment in Europe, which are then taken up and expanded by the Member States. It is also deliberately democratic, as it is open to both governmental and non-governmental organizations. For this reason, ladies and gentlemen, I urge you not to vote for the amendments, which in no way reflect the spirit of LIFE. Through associations, LIFE can in fact be used directly by European citizens for measures in the general interest. For several million – I emphasize: millions – members of NGOs, LIFE demonstrates the Union's will to implement an ambitious policy in favor of the natural environment. LIFE is also the fundamental instrument for the Natura 2000 network in Europe, to which the Member States have committed themselves in accordance with the Community directive on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora and the migratory birds directive, and which enables the protection of biologically valuable areas in our countries. I would add that those who denigrate this policy in their own countries are responsible for slowing down nature conservation policy in Europe. This is regrettable, because everyone in this Chamber knows that the LIFE financial instrument is insufficient to implement all the projects submitted by the Member States, many of which have to be rejected for lack of funding. It should not be forgotten that LIFE is currently endowed with only EUR 100 million a year, which represents less than one thousandth of the Union budget. By way of comparison, agriculture, which has a real impact on the environment, as we all know, spends EUR 37 billion. In view of this, my group considers it essential to increase the LIFE budget and fully supports Mrs Lienemann's proposal to increase the budget to EUR 850 million. We know – and this must be said – how high our fellow citizens' expectations are in the environmental field and how half-hearted and unacceptable the Council's compromise on LIFE's financial framework is, all the more so given that the LIFE programmes have exceptionally high implementation rates and have made an effective contribution to the development of new environmental practices. This undoubtedly includes the first sustainable development projects. Mr President, the European Union's environment programme, with its considerable budget (EUR 613 million), raises numerous questions regarding the proper use of public funds. A financial instrument of this size must be transparent and efficient, which is not the case here for the following reasons: poorly defined criteria, dubious and uncoordinated projects, no publication of financial statements, and the absence of evaluation measures.	de
"In order to facilitate the achievement of this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods as those who have received appropriate professional training. The objective of this professional training for advisers was to provide knowledge of the essential legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions applicable to such transport. While this was a step forward at the time, the lack of specific provisions on the harmonisation of examination conditions proved problematic. It was therefore considered essential to fill this gap in order to achieve a high and uniform level of training for safety advisers and to avoid disparities in training costs, which would consequently affect competition between undertakings in the Member States. The Commission proposal aims to ensure uniform training for safety advisers, defines the minimum content of the examinations and defines the tasks of the competent authority and the requirements that the examining bodies must comply with. Our Parliament has expressed its support for the text. However, it tabled several amendments, most of which were incorporated into the Council's common position, in particular the need to draw up a questionnaire and declarations on the issuing of certain documents in the context of the ""specification of the examination procedures proposed by the examination board"". On the other hand, in order to be realistic, I support the postponement of the date of application of these provisions to three months after the entry into force of the directive. I conclude by insisting that harmonisation of the professional qualifications of these consultants will help to improve the quality of service in the interests of users, will minimise the risk of accidents liable to damage the environment and seriously harm the physical integrity of all those who might come into contact with dangerous goods. Koch report (A5-0104/1999) Last October I spoke on Mr Hatzidakis's report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail. My speech today will not be very different from what I said then. In practice, it is this: I deplore the fact that in such an important sector as the transport of dangerous goods, the adoption of harmonised standards is being incessantly postponed to the detriment of human and environmental safety. I would recall that a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on the transport of dangerous goods by road entered into force on 1 January 1997. It included a certain number of transitional provisions valid until 1 January 1999. It is from that date that we should have taken a decision on a proposal from the European Commission aimed at eliminating these derogations. According to the usual procedure, the CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation, proposes standards for this sector which are subsequently included in the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road, signed in Geneva in 1957 (known by the acronym ADR), which is in force throughout Europe and whose provisions serve as the basis for the legislation applicable in the EU. CEN was unable to complete its work within the time frame set."	it
"However, I wonder: If Turkey offers a brigade, should we also grant it the right to participate in decision-making on this policy? Indeed, structurally, there are several ""Haiders"" in the Turkish government. That seems questionable to me. Secondly, the Baltic states are also offering their services. Will they also be included in our defense policy? That is, to say the least, a rather interesting position. Mr. High Representative, you have emphatically recalled the progress we have made in this area from the Amsterdam Summit to the Helsinki Summit, and also the decisions already taken after Helsinki, for example, on the creation of the three committees or on the planning of a 50,000- to 60,000-strong rapid reaction force, which were also recently adopted during the informal meeting in Sintra. However, this rapid progress highlights even more clearly the gap between these decisions and the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference. In my view, we must find a viable compromise within this framework between those who rightly push for accelerated communitarization of this policy area and those who believe that such progress must continue to be achieved at the intergovernmental level. To the latter, I would say: pay attention, because this policy requires strong democratic legitimacy! We are aware of the weight of public opinion when it comes to foreign and security policy. I therefore ask you, only briefly of course, whether you believe some of the following issues can be addressed within the framework of the reform: redefinition of the dual structure between the Commission and the High Representative; a clear and unaffected differentiation between civilian and military crisis management. For the time being, this could mean, for example, integrating the Commission into the Political and Security Affairs Committee; strengthening the Community's competence for non-military crisis management; creating a Council of Defence Ministers; and harmonizing the EU Treaty, the NATO Treaty, and the WEU; Other questions would be the legal capacity of the European Union, increased cooperation in this area, parliamentary scrutiny, and, finally, financial resources. Do you think that some of these issues could at least be included on the agenda of the current Intergovernmental Conference? Mr. Solana, I'm sitting close enough to look you in the eye. I think you've aged; your face is full of wrinkles. I'm sorry to see you like this, and I could despair when I hear you talk about sandbox games, as Mrs. Maes said, while at the same time keeping quiet about other things. You appear here and don't say a word about the blood that is being shed in Kosovo at this very moment. Yet you, of all people, bear enormous responsibility, because under the pretext of ethnic cleansing, blood is now flowing in Kosovo in other ethnic cleansings. You are Spanish, you come from a great country, Mr. Solana. Spain was not like Franco; it maintained its unity and kept the Basque Country, Andalusia, and Catalonia—and that was quite right. Nobody equated Spain with Franco, and nobody jeopardized Spain's unity by foisting a fascist dictator. But today you identify Yugoslavia with Milosevic, you jeopardize Vojvodina, you jeopardize Montenegro, you jeopardize southern Serbia—you are responsible for the situation that has arisen."	de
"But I was even more shocked to read that the French public authorities involved had known about this for days and had not asked the volunteers to take protective measures. I would like the Commissioner to inform me whether the European Commission was aware that there was a potential risk to public health, and if so, since when. Mr. President, we must learn lessons from the past. Tomorrow, maritime disasters like the Erika disaster could happen again off the coast of the Netherlands, England, Spain, or Belgium. The regulations we adopt today in Europe will be considered a precedent. Therefore, let us be tough on polluters and generous to those affected. Mr. President, I would like to say, echoing the words of some Members, that the situation, two and a half months after the shipwreck, remains particularly critical and is even becoming more widespread every day. There are two points of view: the environmental one, to begin with. The hull still contains 16,000 tons of leaking heavy fuel oil; And in addition to these leaks, last week we observed and recorded, unfortunately, thirty-five acts of ecological piracy, thirty-five tank cleanings, which are undignifiedly added to this absolutely catastrophic situation. Regarding this problem, Mrs. de Palacio has gone into great lengths, and I believe she has initiated the work without waiting for what is absolutely necessary today: the outline of European maritime law, thanks to a draft directive on the transport of dangerous goods by sea. From this perspective, she will once again encounter the French will to mark her presidency with regulations aimed at greater safety. But it is at the economic level where the second impact is occurring—first the environmental impact, second the economic impact—as many Members have said here. Shellfish farming, fishing, oyster farming, and fish farming are currently severely affected. Because the oil spill is compounded by the damage caused by the storm, in many places. Unfortunately, these activities have been terribly damaged. They will have, on the one hand, to rebuild, and on the other, perhaps more complicated, to regain commercial confidence. Faced with this situation, the inhabitants of Brittany, the Vendée, and the Charente, and foresters in other areas, await a signal from the European Union. We cannot, at the same time, frame this mandate as a rapprochement with citizens and remain ""silent,"" without concrete responses, in the face of phenomena of this magnitude and magnitude. I have taken note, and with great care, of Commissioner Fischler's words, which are perhaps the most concrete we have heard today. It is true that there have been expressions of compassion and solidarity, and some announcements have been made, but today it is time for a concrete manifestation of European solidarity to follow this waiting period. The Erika oil spill is one of the catalogue of disasters that have recently occurred in Community waters, including the Braer oil spill in Shetland and the Sea Empress oil spill in Wales. These spills, in addition to causing irreparable ecological damage, have devastated local industries."	es
These proposals particularly benefit women. In parallel with this European strategy for social convergence, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social field and proposals for framework agreements, with pre-established timetables, are needed in the area of social dialogue. We hope that the Commission will present this in its proposal for a social action program. Social convergence is also necessary for enlargement, on the one hand, to strengthen the social model and, on the other, to prevent the risks of social dumping. In connection with enlargement, the Commission should consider presenting a special action plan in social policy matters. The discussions in committee have been constructive. There were many amendments, but we managed to agree on a report. The amendments that will now be voted on in plenary are only fifteen. This means that there has been a great deal of unity of opinion. Some of these amendments stem from the committee's processing. I will reject those. I will also reject the amendments tabled by the TDI Group, since, in my opinion, they add nothing new to the report. However, my group will approve Amendment 14 from the Liberal Group. I think it is a good proposal. It is true that it is similar to Amendment 1, but Amendment 14 is better. Finally, I would like to say that the EU is not just a partnership of a trade nature. The EU is also a Union for employment and social justice. Social policy has a major role to play in creating a Europe of citizens. With this report, Parliament wishes to make its contribution to strengthening the social dimension in European society. We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and incorporate it into future social policy. The Lisbon Summit is an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this nature. Mr. President, I would like to sincerely congratulate the rapporteur, Mr. Andersson, on the report on the modernization of social protection presented here. As coordinator of the European People's Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am very pleased with the compromise reached, for which Mr. Andersson has worked very hard. I am also very pleased that it has continued from a previous Parliament report, of which I was the rapporteur, and the lines of this report are partly also those of the previous one. The objective of the Commission's June 1999 communication, which forms the basis of the Andersson report, is to deepen collaboration between the Member States and the EU in the area of social protection. The other secondary objectives are: promoting employment, that is, ensuring that work provides a stable income; secondly, achieving secure pensions and viable pension systems; thirdly, promoting social inclusion; and fourthly, ensuring viable, high-quality health care. Gender-related aspects must play an important role in all of these objectives.	es
The first legal challenge arose when port development work began in early autumn 1999, without compensatory habitat improvements having been made. The Irish authorities therefore agreed to proceed with the grass removal, but this time they did so using mechanical means. The use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge—to which I referred in my first answer—based on the argument that mechanical removal may have damaged the underlying layers of the mudflat and caused grass to proliferate in the estuary, with consequent environmental damage. To date, there has been no conclusive outcome of that legal challenge. The adoption of appropriate compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities and does not require prior approval from the Commission. The Commission's role is to ensure that the standards set by the Wild Birds Directive are faithfully complied with, and there is no doubt that there would be problems with compensatory measures that have also caused damage. In this case, the Commission proposes seeking further clarification from the Irish authorities on the current position regarding compensatory measures and potential problems with the mechanical removal of grasses. At this time, we are not prepared to propose suspending funding from the Structural Funds. Mr. President, unfortunately, the specific case raised by Mrs. McKenna is not an isolated one. There are other examples of conservation in special scientific fields being harmed as a result of Community funding. Will the Commission consider instructing all Member States that, if in the future it is found that European environmental directives are being breached or that a proper environmental impact assessment is not being carried out, it will not only suspend funding but also withdraw the funds that have already been granted—in other words, reclaim the funds from the Member States? Only measures of this kind will curb these practices in the future. (SV) This is a matter of great importance. As Members of the European Parliament are surely aware, our predecessors in the Commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies, jointly sent a letter last year on the relationship between the Structural Funds, Structural Fund money, and the Habitats and Birds Directive. The message sent in this joint letter is still valid today. We cannot give countries money with one hand and with the other take them to court and, perhaps, force them to pay fines. That is why it is important that this be coordinated. Obviously, the result could lead us to have to make difficult decisions. However, in my opinion, the main effect is that countries will think carefully and, above all, will send their lists of Natura 2000 sites, so that we can monitor and conduct appropriate studies. Ireland has shortcomings in this regard, as do other Member States, but we hope that this pressure will yield results. Once again, I want to emphasize that the content of this letter is still valid.	es
I must confess that even in my own country, Flanders, we still have a long way to go. We too have recently been criticised by the Commission in this regard. Every reasonable person wants this framework directive to be used to put pressure on negligent politicians. The common position on this point is a farce, a completely voluntary effort, a real affront to the OSPAR agreements. Not to mention the deadlines for implementation, which can even be extended up to 34 years. Then my children will be older than I am now. Let's face it: this is not a serious proposal. Tomorrow we will have the choice between a weak and non-binding framework that will poison our children's future; or we can vote in favour of the amendments of my group, the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Finally, one more point. In recent months, lobbying activities have intensified enormously and what has particularly struck me in this dossier is the pressure exerted by the Council of Ministers. In my country, even by the Flemish and Walloon Ministries of the Environment. The Ministers have preferred the weak common position to the strong position of our Parliament. I wonder whether this choice was made with the approval of the Green Ministers of the Environment of my country. Ladies and gentlemen, fine words are no longer enough. We must change course with great determination. Tomorrow, when we vote, we have the opportunity to say clearly that Europe is committed to a responsible and future-oriented water policy, which can only help to strengthen our credibility. The debate is suspended. It will resume at 9 p.m. Dialogue on Europe: perspectives for institutional reform The next item on the agenda is the Commission communication on Dialogue on Europe: perspectives for institutional reform. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this right now and is far from concluding its work today. So I am here essentially to talk to you, as your House's agenda indicates, about a new initiative by the Commission, which intends to give its response, which is not the only one, to the great challenge of mobilising all the players in the European construction. Among them, in the front row, there are you as parliamentarians, but I am also there as Commissioner, as well as the Council Ministers, the national parliamentarians and I would even say the officials who work in our institutions and who are committed and motivated by the European construction. This morning, in the long debate which I attended alongside President Prodi, many of you mentioned the democratic deficit, the remoteness of the European institutions. In saying this, I am not just raising the question - which has already been formulated clearly and forcefully by one of you: who does what? At the very least, citizens need to understand who does what among our various institutions. It is also essentially a question of knowing: what are we doing together and what do we intend to do in the future, in particular with the countries that will soon be joining?	it
From this perspective, activity-based management is the key tool for ensuring correspondence between objectives, actions and resources. The second point is human resources. This is the backbone of our action: staff are our true wealth, they are the wealth of the Commission. They are staff of the highest quality, a quality that is difficult - perhaps impossible - to find in individual national administrations, precisely because of the methods and criteria for recruiting staff. This is the impression I had when I came to the Presidency and which I have confirmed in my daily work. However, at the same time, I found very low morale on the part of the administration: before, there was pride, the pleasure of being part of an institution admired by all; today there is often demoralisation, generated by months and months of criticism. All this must change, and this is one of the fundamental motivations for our reform. Recruitment, career structure, mobility, disciplinary regime, everything is regulated with absolutely new criteria: more space for individual merit, credible and above all verifiable evaluation systems, continuous training and greater responsibility for managers. These are the areas in which we will move. Third point, also very delicate and key in the previous crisis: financial management. This is the crux that must ensure efficiency and security. We will create a management and control system in each Directorate-General. Today we have a fully centralised control system; with the reform we are moving to a control system that combines decentralisation of management controls and an effective central audit system: this means that we will have a central financial service, which will provide guidance and advice for financial management, decentralisation in each Directorate-General of the entire chain, i.e. programmes, commitments, contracts, expenditure and the related ex ante control systems, and an external audit service that will monitor all these operations. This is a complete revolution in the way the Commission works, it is a completely new organisation, which also requires a completely new culture. We are aware of the problems linked to this transition phase and it is this transition that has caused most concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security and safeguard measures. With the reform, in fact, the Commission wants to become an administration that is a model of excellence throughout Europe and the world. We also want to be a model for the advanced use of information technology. We want to be a model of fully computerised administration. The Commission has been accused of being buried under paper and we will then be a paperless Commission, that is, a Commission without the use of paper instruments. This is to be more efficient internally and to multiply the use of new technologies externally. This is a revolution that is not only technical but a complete organisational revolution. I will now leave it to Neil Kinnock to explain the details of this reform, not without first thanking him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy with which he has carried out this work.	it
"First of all, perhaps the most important aspect of the proposal is the idea - intrinsic to recycling and reusing waste - of using materials that can subsequently pollute less. Another important point is that waste - including waste containing PVC - and not just waste containing lead, cadmium and mercury - should not be incinerated or shredded. Parliament is involved in a debate on this elsewhere. Another issue is who should pay the costs. I agree with previous speakers when they say that 'the polluter pays', and our proposal underlines this better than ever. Although we know that in the end the costs will probably be passed on to consumers, it is the producers who must pay, and they are required to cover the costs prior to 2006 under some of the amendments. In any case, we prefer the first reading amendment. It is also important to set the percentage and the date by which vehicles must be made of recyclable materials, but I think the proposal sets deadlines that are very far away. Finally, Mr President, I believe it is necessary to encourage the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises which, rigorously approved and with the necessary authorisation, can promote the creation of jobs in this crucial sector, avoiding the monopolies of large companies. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament must face real responsibilities today. It is a question of establishing what we will do with the millions of vehicles that we abandon every year. In some of our States, voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed so that our ditches, canals and fields no longer fill up with those hideous and dangerous abandoned cars, from which a frightened chicken occasionally emerges. Naturally, I come from a country that is proud of its car industry and its commercial successes, both in Europe and in third countries. And I value its importance for the international prestige of my country. I am aware of the proactive behaviour of the European car industry which has implemented a vast research programme to develop a national information system for the dismantling of vehicles at the end of their life. I am aware of the difficulties the Council has encountered in finding a compromise. That is why today we must be understanding alchemists, concerned about our environment. This century must necessarily be the century of waste management. For me, in any case, the ""polluter pays"" principle must be applied. I am sure that the car industry, increasingly respectful of the environment, had foreseen this awareness. And it assumes its responsibilities. But it is up to the States to apply this directive, and let us be careful not to detail it too much, because the industrial traditions, the methods of the demolition and shredding professionals are different depending on whether we are in Italy or Finland. I oppose making the owners of the vehicles responsible. These men and women who travel in Europe pay for their cars, their national taxes, their catalytic converters, their fuel taxes, and therefore they already pay a high price for their splendid car and the freedom to travel."	it
Our general policy, however, is to recognize the inherent dignity and exceptional contribution of indigenous peoples to the development and plurality of society, which we consider particularly important in the context of the Northern Dimension, which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America. The Commission shares the growing concern over the disappearance of the Russian journalist, Mr. Babitsky, and the conditions of independent media in Chechnya in general. This issue is at the top of our list of major concerns in the face of the critical situation of the civilian population in Chechnya, to which Mr. Posselt has just referred. There are alarming reports of human rights violations. It is clear that there has been a disproportionate use of force in this conflict. The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a demarche of the European Union Troika on the 11th of this month. She highlighted her serious concerns regarding freedom of the press and freedom of expression and urged the Russians to clarify the circumstances of Mr. Babitstky's detention, taking into account their human rights obligations. We expect an appropriate response from the Russians. Meanwhile, the conclusions reached by the General Affairs Council earlier this week confirmed the message I gave today. We are ready to revisit the issue at the EU-Russia ministerial troika in Lisbon on 2 March, if necessary. Finally, regarding Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge, we fully agree that the highest-ranking Khmer Rouge leaders must be able to be prosecuted for the crimes for which they are responsible. I fully agree with the arguments put forward by Mr. Morillon. We strongly supported the troika's approach to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong on 4 February this year. The European Union has emphasized its full support for the UN's efforts regarding the need for a tribunal to prosecute the former leaders of the Khmer Rouge. Furthermore, we also welcome the ongoing dialogue between the two parties. The optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, about the chances of reaching an agreement on the proposed tribunal is encouraging. The Commission will continue to remind the Cambodian authorities of the problems relating to the rule of law, democratic principles, and human rights, through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement, which entered into force on 1 November. Debating human rights twice in a few days has been useful. I hope we will have more opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their violations in the years to come. Thank you very much, Mr. Patten. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 6 p.m. Environmental disaster in the waters of the Danube The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: B5-0164/2000 by Mr Leinen, on behalf of the PSE Group, B5-0167/2000 by Mr Maaten and Mr Thors, on behalf of the ELDR, B5-0168/2000 by Mr Oostlander and Mr Grossetête, on behalf of the PPE-DE,	fr
Thus, we have been presented with an urgent request, which we have granted. We have been asked for €35 million. We agree to grant it and ask the Commission to be very vigilant so that, once the decision is taken, the sums are committed and disbursed as quickly as possible. This is a macro-financial aid. It has provoked reactions here and there because it does not respect the canons of liberal beauty, which consist of not intervening financially to support an administration. That is not our opinion. Our opinion is that it is essential to contribute to the establishment of an administration in Kosovo, and there is nothing absurd about directly contributing to the payment of public officials in that region. Furthermore, it would have been something very useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the liquefaction of that state. The second major problem is that we have been asked, the donors have made commitments, and it is clear that we are the only ones paying. The others do not pay. We call for an end to this unilateral approach to financial solicitation. We want the Commission to commit to the amendments we propose in this regard. We want to link the delivery of all aid to the mobilization of funds owed by other donors. This is not to limit or skimp on our financial support for Kosovo, but, on the contrary, to ensure that our contribution is matched by that of other donors. From this perspective, the proposed aid package is a two-stage aid program, and the second tranche should be released as soon as donors have expressed their interest. Finally, we have three questions for the Commission in this regard: first, we must be regularly provided with the list and amounts of contributions from other donors. We want to know what others are paying at the time we are paying. Second, we want an accurate record of the calls for tender and the pace of their commitments. During the budgetary procedure, we were told that it was urgent to vote on the money for Kosovo, and according to our information, to date it has not yet been made public, nor has any call for tenders been organized. This is serious, as it delays the entire reconstruction process in Kosovo. Finally—and as a consequence of what I just said—we want the Commission to report very regularly, monthly, to the Committee on Budgets on the status of expenditure implementation. We have Commission documents that speak of firm commitments. We do not need firm commitments; we simply need commitments, and we need to know what is actually being paid and, above all, what is not being paid. Kosovo has suffered too much from payment delays. Mr. President, as we have spoken about Kosovo so often today, and it is time to take stock of what has already been achieved in Kosovo, if anything has been achieved.	es
With regard to the future provisions on aid to the steel industry, which will come into force in July 2002, we will ensure that rigorous discipline continues to be applied, the need for which is now shared by the industrial circles themselves. When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and chosen the most suitable legal form, I will be happy to explain our vision to you. Well, Mr President, what I take home from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, is the intellectual and political support, I believe without distinction, of the European Parliament for competition policy, a fundamental appreciation for the work that the Commission is doing and a confidence that it can continue to do so in the future, things for which I am particularly grateful. We will continue, in particular with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but more generally with Parliament, the interinstitutional dialogue that has been established. In this regard, I liked your expression, Mrs Palacio: we must all row and, if possible, in the same direction. Competition is not an objective, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but a very important instrument in our European construction. As Mr von Wogau said at the beginning of the debate, competition is ultimately not an abstract thing: it is in the interests of citizens, it is the basis of the social market economy. I would also like to say that, in the European construction, competition has had and will continue to have a civil and not just economic value. Thank you, Commissioner Monti. The joint debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. Criminal law protection of the Union's financial interests The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, containing Parliament's recommendations to the Commission on the establishment of criminal law protection of the Union's financial interests. Mr President, year after year we learn, especially from the reports of the European Court of Auditors, that the European Union budget suffers losses due to waste, mismanagement, irregularities and - as is suspected - even outright fraud. Parliament has long been involved in initiatives to protect European taxpayers' money, which ultimately feeds the Union budget. In this context, the fight against fraud, aimed at revealing, punishing and preventing such practices, deserves particular attention. The establishment of UCLAF, the task force and the creation of the Anti-Fraud Office OLAF were important steps on this path, as was the regulation on the protection of the Community's financial interests and on-the-spot checks. In obvious cases of fraud, however, the Union can only impose administrative sanctions; so far, the Commission's requests for the restitution of funds received without due cause have had little success; criminal prosecution is instead reserved to the Member States. Since the two legal areas often overlap, and since actions against the Union budget are increasing in all countries and are also perpetrated by organised crime, the competences between Member States are not always clear.	it
"And it was a woman who was elected. The other event concerns France, where a law was passed aimed at ensuring equal representation for women and men, following the declaration made in April 1999 at the ""Women and Men in Power"" congress. The ministers concerned committed to taking concrete measures and policies that would change the balance of power. We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for having endorsed this commitment in the clearest and most formal manner. Numerous declarations have been made and policies implemented in the Member States. Certainly, the figures speak for themselves. And the figures for Europe are still problematic. Women represent 24% of members of governments, and an average of 22% of members of national parliaments, a rate varying from 6% in some Member States to 40% in others. The number of women in committees exercising power, developing policies, is very low. Even in countries like Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal obligations regarding the number of representatives of both sexes, the participation rate of women in the various committees does not exceed 18%. Therefore, concrete policies must be promoted. We need a mixed policy that will include long-term political commitments, as is now the case in Sweden and Finland, where we now have a rate of 56 and 44% women in government, respectively. We need organization and statistical monitoring. We need appropriate control and structures based on the culture, mentalities, and specific problems of each region. And, naturally, these policies require a budget, financial support. Increasing the number of women, or, as French Prime Minister Jospin has stated, increasing women's influence in decision-making centres, is the best way to renovate political life, to change the approach to problems, to enrich political thinking with new ideas and experiences - those that women transmit through their different lifestyles and development. The recent initiative of the Finnish Presidency to establish indicators that record and reflect women's participation in decision-making centres is of great importance. These are indicators that encompass national parliaments, regional councils, municipal councils, and give a comprehensive picture of women's participation in each Member State. I believe that creating and supporting statistical data is a major political issue, a political tool or means for setting targets, comparing performance and supporting our efforts. Such an initiative for systematic monitoring is also included in the draft that I am going to submit for the fifth programme for women. It should be added that, while legislative measures and institutional interventions by Member States have an impact on the decision-making centres of political power, we do not observe the same effects in the private sector. From my contacts with very large European companies and multinationals on our continent, a dramatic picture emerges. There are companies that employ thousands of workers at European level, and often hundreds of thousands at global level, and in which the participation of women in management and leadership is less than 2%!"	fr
I fear very much that we are once again inheriting an authority that moves like an anonymous satellite across Europe: I would welcome such an authority like the devil holy water. I hope it does not come to that. I also welcome the White Paper. But do you think the food safety agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war we have experienced and to prevent France refusing to lift the ban? You have said that the Commission could refrain from granting subsidies to countries that act like France? Would you also suggest that the Commission could make interim payments, for example, similar to those that British farmers are now demanding? Mr President, Commissioner, you said in last week's plenary session that the future European Food Safety Agency would not be located on the periphery, but you did not say what you meant by periphery. For example, the work of the EU unit established in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no longer an obstacle to efficiency and networking. The primary tasks of the future food agency have been the subject of data collection, numerous announcements, and a great deal of coordination. Recommendations for the development of this food safety have been published and - as you have seen - scientific knowledge has been pooled and disseminated. With current technology, all of this can be done anywhere in the European Union. So I ask you where you plan to locate this agency. As for the composition of the authority: firstly, it will employ local scientists who will collaborate and consult with scientific experts in the particular fields being studied at a given time. In addition, this food safety authority will have a council. You will notice that we have not specified the composition of this council in the White Paper. This is an issue I expect to be discussed between Parliament and the Commission in the coming weeks and months. I envisage the council being made up of key players or representatives of key players. Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will present to the Commission in September. We have not done this yet, but it will be done in September. I do not expect the council to have any function of directing scientists in how to carry out their work. That would undermine the independence of scientific advice. But it would have overall competence, which would include, for example, asking this authority to investigate particular areas requiring research. Mr. Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in this matter. This is a matter that requires consideration and discussion. There may be a number of views on this. Some might argue that it would not be wise for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or, indeed, people appointed by Parliament - to be part of the council.	fr
We know that this directive is based on EC law and not on EU law. Before the elections, however, all of us - the Council, the Commission, Parliament, the press, the trade unions and companies - worked to make this Europe more understandable to the citizens. We demanded that the citizen should be able to move from the EEC to the EC and then to the EU. The EU is now a clear concept. We will therefore be doing ourselves and the citizens no good if the document we issue is called an EC service provision card and not an EU card. The citizen is interested in the EU world, that is his world. I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to move in this direction. Mr President, it is later than expected at the beginning of this session, so I will try to be as brief as possible. One of the reasons why we have been so late is that we have rightly devoted part of our time today to reaffirming this Parliament's vigorous opposition to any form of xenophobia and racism. Of course, the directive does not directly address these issues. It does address the needs of the internal market, as well as the need to ensure flexibility and to adopt a reasonable and flexible attitude to enable third-country nationals to find employment both as employees and as self-employed. This in itself means avoiding unnecessary restrictions on foreigners simply because they are foreigners. We fully agree with this approach, which we believe to be appropriate and reasonable, and we will therefore support the broadest possible interpretation that we believe to be in accordance with the law. Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to highlight the excellent work done by Mrs Berger and, in general, by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which has included innovative ideas in this directive, which I hope will be taken up by the Commission and the Council. I have, however, tabled an amendment. Mr Berger, in Amendment No 2, to recital 6, you call for legal certainty. The first point on which we disagree is the three-month extension of the residence permit, which in reality creates legal uncertainty. You have expressed the concern, shared by Mr Wieland, that a worker might disappear once his work permit has expired, but it seems to me that this possibility is strengthened by the three-month extension. If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date, it must expire on that date; legal certainty demands it. Secondly, with regard to point (d) of Amendment No 10, which refers to the first Directive, it is provided that, for reasons of public security or public order, a Member State may challenge the validity of the card. There are already ex ante checks provided for in Article 4 of the Directive. Such a provision would make no sense for a worker from the Schengen area, who has already been checked to enter the first Member State; the second Member State may, ex ante, oppose a justified refusal to allow that worker to enter its territory.	it

"For the aquaculture and oyster farming sectors, defenseless against the pollution that inexorably washes up on the coasts, the consequences are very serious, not only because of the immediate pollution in the first few days, but also because of the subsequent loss of market share and consumer rejection of a product with all the guarantees, but which is itself compromised by the pollution. These are peripheral areas with a precarious economic balance, which has been severely damaged by this oil spill, which, unfortunately, is not an isolated incident. The main resources of these regions—like those of other neighboring areas—are those provided by nature. Nature that is too often damaged by human activity, which could be prevented with greater prudence and stronger control by the public authorities. ""Prevention is better than cure,"" as the saying goes, and the budget also says. Ladies and gentlemen, prevention is very cheap compared to the cost of disasters like this. Mr. Fischler says he is always there when Parliament calls him. In the case of the Erika, however, he gave the impression – perhaps not to us, but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and Vendée – that he was not available as Commissioner for Fisheries, or only temporarily. As this Parliament already pointed out in its first resolution of 20 January of this year, the needs of fishing companies, oyster farming, and tourism, which are particularly affected, must be taken into account. That is why we called on the Commission then to urgently adopt measures for the fisheries sector by mobilizing special funds. Galicia and Brittany, both at the ends of the earth in Europe, have become sisters as a result of this oil spill. Nor can we understand why experiences like those of the Urquiola or the Amoco-Cádiz have not led to strengthening maritime legislation, both with regard to safety in the transport of dangerous goods and with regard to flags of convenience. We demand that this time be the last. We demand that we all learn lessons and swiftly amend our laws and fill the gaps that repeatedly confront us with the unbelievable and make the unbelievable a reality. The polluter pays principle seems appropriate and, moreover, necessary. It is now time for the polluters to start paying, because so far, it has been the victims and the taxpayers who have paid. And the polluters should not only pay, but also clean up the affected areas. I am therefore pleased with Mr. Fischler's response, especially his recognition of the need for retroactive measures and a rapid response to the requests received. On behalf of my group, the Socialist Group, I would like to send a message of solidarity to those affected: to the fishermen, farmers, and entrepreneurs who ensure that the sea delivers its products to the markets on time, to the mayors and political leaders, as well as the volunteers who participated in the cleanup. They all rest assured of our solidarity. I would like to ask the Commissioner two questions. Parliament adopted a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this case and for both the shipowner and the cargo owner to be held liable for the damage."	de
"Mr President, I agree that from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of services offered in relation to costs, progress still needs to be made. But why always under the banner of ""privatization"" and ""liberalization""? I myself do not understand that at all, and I am a business leader. Except that we are not concerned with ensuring identical conditions of access to postal services for everyone, but that we are only concerned with the conditions for capital development for companies in large urban areas. However, Members of Parliament must be the representatives of all citizens, and that means that they are obliged to think not in terms of business economics but in terms of political economy. Very concretely for postal services, that means, firstly, that the question of employment must be a priority. I have nothing against liberalization and privatization, but the premises must be in agreement. Secondly, we must have a guarantee that there will be no reduction in postal services for citizens. Examples from Germany and Sweden show that this threat is very real. Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country where, after liberalization, prices have radically exceeded those in all other Member States of the European Union. This is precisely one possible effect. We must ensure that this does not happen. Thirdly, it remains essential, firstly, to ensure a universal postal service at a reasonable price for every citizen, everywhere. Secondly, a single price must be observed for all Member States. And thirdly, mail delivery and collection must be guaranteed every working day. As for the question of the price/service ratio for the respective weight categories of postal items, further price reductions are possible. This is also what the Post Office itself states. We must not stay at more than 300g; the analysis shows that a minimum limit of 150g must be guaranteed so that this can still be counted. I believe that today's debate has been beneficial and important insofar as Mr Bolkestein knows the position of this Parliament and can therefore also take account of the problems from the outset. Mr President, the 1997 directive, published on 21 January 1998, which initiated a partial liberalisation of postal services in Europe, provided for a subsequent revision, albeit in a complicated form, since it was to be the subject of a Commission proposal before the end of 1998, then to be decided before 1 January 2000, and finally to enter into force before 1 January 2003. However, at the moment, the revision is at ground zero. The first two stages have not been complied with, which, logically, should jeopardise the third. First question: in any case, were the deadlines provided not too short? Clearly, yes. It is really difficult to see how the Commission could have assessed, before the end of 1998, as provided for in Article 7 of the directive, the effects of a text which entered into force in February of that year."	fr
I encourage Members to ensure with their votes today that we succeed in establishing a sound foundation for Europe in the short term, if not in the longer term. Mr. President, my first words of thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr. Schmidt, to my colleague, Mr. Goebbels, and to my colleagues from the Villiers and Lulling Group, who, despite holding differing positions on some points, have always displayed an extraordinarily constructive attitude. As the rapporteur has already pointed out, we are probably discussing one of the most important issues we will discuss in this parliamentary term. Collective investment schemes have long been the primary savings instrument, the instrument through which millions of individual citizens, non-experts, non-professionals, consign or transfer their life savings to these institutions. This would be the first reason to say that liberalization must proceed, but with caution. Why? Because the failure of a bank is a problem that can be solved by any government. The bankruptcy, the suspension of payments, of an organization of this nature would create a political, social, and civic problem of incalculable consequences. A second argument leads me to emphasize the need for prudence in the regulation of these organizations. It is my belief in the social market economy, which is based on a functioning market, but one that operates subject to certain rules designed to guarantee the general interest, which, at this particular time and on this particular issue, is limited to consumer protection. This basic principle of liberalization, increased competition, and increased investment opportunities, linked to prudence for the protection that consumers deserve, is what has determined and inspired my Group's position on most of the controversial issues that have been raised here. First, the problem of investment in non-harmonized organizations, that is, in organizations that fall outside the scope of this directive. It is obvious that, by expanding the proposal we are studying here, the possibilities, the investment range of collective investment schemes, those schemes that remain outside will be forced to invest in high-risk funds. And it would be foolish to allow regulated schemes, protected schemes, to invest in schemes dedicated to such risky investments as those I have mentioned. Secondly, the issue of derivatives is one that has divided us most, internally within the Group and in relation to other Groups. We have reached a compromise solution. We all agree that investment in derivatives must be limited by regulation, by law, to prevent a harmonized fund from losing all its assets through an investment in high-risk products. It is obvious that this risk is greater when the investment is in derivatives not traded on regulated markets, the famous OTCs. We believe we have reached an acceptable compromise solution, and I congratulate myself on that. As this topic does not end here but will return to this House, I would like to make some reference to the working method between the Commission and Parliament. The texts we are discussing here are old, and they were already old when they arrived in this Parliament because they had undergone significant changes during the Finnish Presidency of the Council. We are faced with two options: return the matter to the pen, that is, return the proposals to the Commission so it can send us a harmonized text, or continue moving forward.	es
Undoubtedly, the events in Kosovo and in the Balkans as a whole have touched all of our hearts and minds; there have been important developments in the Middle East, where the President of Parliament played a significant role on her recent visit; some important things have happened to pave the way for the Europe-Africa Summit, which I was privileged to attend with the Portuguese Presidency; there was the major meeting in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen Latin American countries to forge closer relations between the European Union and the countries of Latin America. Undoubtedly, Chechnya was also close to our hearts, and I will have the opportunity to say a few words on it at the end of my remarks, after an important discussion this morning with the representative of the Council of Europe, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, about his recent visit to the region. But I understand that you have invited me here to report to you directly on foreign policy and, above all, security policy in Europe after Helsinki. I will briefly address this; If you wish to put any questions to me during Question Time, I will be happy to answer them. Allow me to remind you that the Helsinki Summit, under the Finnish Presidency, took place not a century ago, but only two months ago. Fundamental decisions were taken in Helsinki for foreign and security policy on our continent. These were essentially three types of decisions, and I would like to address them. The first was the decision to set up three types of committee within the European Union to take decisions in the field of crisis management: first, a Committee for Political and Security Affairs; second, a Military Committee representing the Chiefs of Defence of the fifteen Member States of the Union; and third, there were decisions concerning the relations that the European Union must maintain with third countries and other organizations. I am referring in particular to the relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance, and to the relations between the European Union and those countries that, although geographically part of Europe, do not belong, or at least do not currently belong, to the European Union. I will essentially limit myself to these three points to keep you informed of developments. First, and as regards the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee (PSC), set up at the last General Affairs Council, met for the first time this morning, March 1, 2000. Thus, two months after the Helsinki Declaration and decision, we are having the first meeting of the PSC in the European Union. I had the opportunity to meet with it this morning and to have lunch with the representatives. I can tell you that you can be satisfied. The fifteen states have appointed expert diplomats at ambassadorial level to address, under their responsibility, one of the most important issues we will have to face in the coming months. Second, the Military Committee, representing the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen states, will hold its first meeting on March 7, just over two months after the Helsinki Declarations. This Military Committee, as you can imagine, has several responsibilities. In a preliminary, interim phase, its main task will be to advise the Council and myself and to make the initial decisions on how to establish the definitive bodies, which we absolutely want to have operational by the end of 2000 or the beginning of next year.	de
Furthermore, an extraordinary budget line must be used, as extraordinary as the catastrophic situation is. First of all, we would like to express our condolences to all the families and communities that have lost a member in this terrible tragedy. The loss of life is what truly makes this particular disaster extraordinary in Europe. It is regrettable that we do not have an instrument with which to provide assistance in situations like this. I would like to thank the Commissioner for his detailed statement on this matter and his proposal that we organize ourselves at the European level to provide assistance to Member States and those in their regions that suffer tragedies like this. That is important. Another thing we must remember is that in the past, we did have a budget line. It was very small. It couldn't do much, but Members of this House repeatedly abused it by proposing actions when the disasters were not even significant. Officials and ministers from Member States went to Brussels, whispered to the Commission, obtained a few euros, and scored a political point by returning with aid for their constituencies. So there wasn't much sympathy for that budget line when it was abolished. I think we should reinstate that budget line. When there was the earthquake in Greece, which was a major disaster, the Community lacked an instrument with which to offer its condolences or solidarity to the Greeks. The same thing happened when there were floods in France and the same thing now. Those are major disasters, and we should have an instrument, which we don't have. We must reinstate that instrument and we must make the rules very strict so that only in situations where major disasters occur do we resort to that particular instrument. We can save it from one year to the next and ensure that when something major happens, we have an instrument to deal with it. This time in Ireland, it wasn't as serious, although we had very strong Atlantic gales. We have also had floods in Ireland, so I want to express my solidarity with the people of Ireland who have suffered through them. Ladies and gentlemen, we should not, all of us, lose our memory. It is true that there is a joint decision by the Commission and Parliament aimed at abolishing the emergency lines. It's also true that there's a lot of European money—Commissioner Barnier has indicated that, in the case of oyster farming and agriculture, Article 30 of the Rural Development Regulation would be used; in the case of forestry, Article 33; in the case of businesses, the derogations from the competition law set out in Article 87(2) of the Treaty; and in the case of public facilities, the Structural Funds. Even so, not a single cent more than what was distributed before the storm will be released today to demonstrate concrete, active solidarity. It's simply a matter of states playing the game of connecting vessels and taking here what they will give elsewhere.	es
It is clear that e-mail and e-commerce will become increasingly important in the future, and I believe that this is a strong point for our post office. We know that by 2002, around 1.2 million jobs will remain unfilled in the field of e-commerce, because there is a shortage of workers with the necessary qualifications to meet the needs of this market. In my opinion, this is an area in which the post office must intervene with training courses, as well as professional and continuing education to prepare its employees to meet this interesting challenge. Existing post offices in rural areas naturally have a strategic advantage, since the post office can rely on a dense distribution network throughout Europe; even the smallest village has a post office. In the future, e-commerce will increasingly use the post office, as many people order goods and send invoices and other documents via e-mail and websites. This also increases the importance of the physical processing of these transactions, which gives new meaning to collection, sorting, transport and delivery. I believe this is an opportunity that we cannot miss for the future. Our job as politicians is to defend the interests of consumers; we want them to be able to get the most out of the money they earn from their work, and reducing the costs of postal services is therefore a key objective. We will have to check, including by benchmarking, how much a consumer currently spends on a public postal worker and how much on a private postal worker. Transparency is also essential for trade unions, because the position of a trade unionist who has to represent his colleagues in a private company is very different from that of a trade unionist for a public postal service; however, I believe that it is also important for the trade union to have similar economic and social framework conditions in order to get the best for workers in a spirit of fairness, loyalty and solidarity. I also think that in future it will be necessary to make the universal service more attractive: we will have to define it precisely, draw up a list of the planned services and put them out to tender. In my opinion, in rural areas, where there is a risk that costs cannot be covered, services should be specified by a regulatory body which should call for tenders to allow all market forces to participate - and therefore also existing postal services - thus following a strategy that is best for the consumer and aimed at stimulating efficiency. In my opinion, we should avoid providing additional subsidies; instead, we must ensure that private companies and consumers can benefit from the new system. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, postal services, like any European public service, contribute to the social cohesion of the Community territory in accordance with Article 16 of the Amsterdam Treaty. By ensuring tariff equalisation, that is to say, strict equality of citizens and economic actors with respect to the cost of the service, by assuming the obligations of the universal service and by adapting to a requirement of quality, postal services share our concern to ensure equal treatment of the different territories and the people who live there.	it
It is true that economic aid, in this respect, is certainly an essential element of the possibilities for action that will be given to those who are present on the ground. I repeat here the statement that Doris Pack has just made to us, and I insist on the fact that we in the European Parliament have to fulfil our responsibilities in this regard, but obviously by asking that we are not alone. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to warmly thank the rapporteur, our colleague Mr Brok, for his report. If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok did, we would indeed be much further ahead. We must truly deplore the Council's negligence in this matter. In his report, the rapporteur quite rightly starts from the principle that we have a duty to provide rapid assistance but also, quite rightly, from the principle that this assistance cannot be offered without limits and without discernment. In this regard, I would particularly like to emphasise Amendment No 5, which makes it very clear that the exceptional financial aid appropriations can only cover the budgetary needs of Kosovo's public, semi-public and municipal administrations and institutions that are controlled directly or indirectly by UNMIK. It must be clear, Commissioner, that we support UNMIK, that we support the institutions set up by the United Nations - in particular, of course, the fourth pillar - and it is unacceptable that we support parallel structures that have been formed and continue to exist in Kosovo. What should be done with this money? I would particularly like to emphasise human rights. In Kosovo, the West fought for human rights. What is happening in Kosovo today? It has been possible to put an end to the large-scale expulsions carried out by the Serbs, but unacceptable incidents are taking place almost every day; People are being killed, people are being prevented from living where they are and as they wish. Every day there are attacks against Serbs, Roma, Bosnians, but also, as before, against Albanians. If this information is correct, I was truly frightened to learn that an Albanian doctor, who worked - certainly with great difficulty - at the hospital located in the Serbian part of Mitroviça, finally gave up operating there for his fellow citizens because his life was regularly threatened. These are incidents and situations that we cannot tolerate. I heard - I don't know if it's true or not - that the Serbs are even continuing to exploit a mine in Kosovo, in the Serbian part. Rumors claim that Serbian militias are still active. I don't care whether the threats or crimes are committed against a Serb, a Roma, a Bosnian, or an Albanian. I don't care who is working to dismember and partition Kosovo. What matters to me is that the bodies we fund achieve the goal we want to achieve, which is a multi-ethnic Kosovo, a coexistence in Kosovo.	fr
"The Commission supports this codification and will work to draft a codified version as soon as possible after the proposals have been adopted, subject to its right of initiative. However, I cannot adopt the wording of the recital as is. Furthermore, the Commission believes that some of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would substantially modify the content of the first proposal. Accordingly, the Commission regrets that it cannot accept the following amendments to the first proposal. Amendment 8 would make implementation of this directive more difficult by replacing the more precise reference to the instruments referred to in ""Article 19 of this Directive"" with the more general reference to investments ""covered by this Directive."" Furthermore, this amendment could lead to divergent interpretations in different Member States, as they will likely seek relevant instruments in other articles of the directive. Amendment 16 jeopardizes investor protection, as the prohibition on providing security with the depositary is a contradictio in termini. Stock exchanges, clearing houses, and securities exchanges also do not automatically cover securities lending transactions carried out through them, unlike securities trading. Therefore, we cannot adopt the proposed amendment. Amendment 42 addresses an issue that was not modified by the proposal and has not raised any problems since the directive entered into force. I therefore see no reason to delete Article 22(3), which leads me to reject the amendment. Amendment 44 is unacceptable because requiring non-harmonized funds to comply with the requirements of the regulations ""imposed by the Directive"" relating to credit, lending, short selling, and the depositary creates a situation in which very few funds, for example Swiss funds, can offer their investment services. This is inconsistent with the Commission's objective of broadening the range of investment modalities. Furthermore, I do not rule out that the wording of the amendment violates the GATT agreements. We also cannot accept the proposed amendments to the first paragraph of Article 22a of Amendment 47, as they contradict the principle of diversification enshrined in Article 22, especially given that UCITS are required to disclose a benchmark in their prospectuses, as agreed by the Council. However, the main problem with the first proposal lies in Parliament's amendment, which considers the possibility of using over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes. The Commission notes that the national law of some Member States already provides for the use of OTC derivatives for general investment purposes. However, the Commission has decided to suspend its view due to the high risks inherent in this type of investment compared to more traditional financial instruments. In my opinion, OTC derivatives can create problems because they are not liquid instruments, their prices are difficult to estimate, and they entail counterparty risks that are not hedged. It seems inconsistent to adopt an overly cautious approach to investments in non-harmonized funds or deposits while allowing free rein to invest in much riskier instruments such as OTC derivatives."	es
Once again, I would like to thank not only the rapporteur but the committee as a whole for the quality of the work carried out. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. Closure of the annual session I declare the 1999-2000 annual session closed. (The sitting will close at 10.41 p.m.) Opening of the annual session I declare the 2000-2001 session of the European Parliament open. Agenda Mr President, the second item on this morning's agenda is the recommendation for second reading on cocoa and chocolate products, for which I am the rapporteur. Yesterday at around 8.30 p.m., I learned purely by chance that the vote was to take place at noon today. However, it seems to me that it was scheduled for noon tomorrow. I am therefore completely unprepared and have not even had the opportunity to prepare the voting list or check whether roll-call votes are necessary. As you know, this issue is quite controversial and has also received considerable media attention. I have been a Member of this Parliament for 10 years and, as rapporteur, I have always been informed when the order of voting has been changed. I would therefore ask that this vote be postponed until tomorrow. This would solve my problem without, I believe, inconveniencing anyone, since it is a relatively short vote. Mr President, we have nothing against this postponement of the vote. I would simply like to insist that the other scheduled votes, in particular on the Lisbon Summit, also take place tomorrow. On this condition, we have nothing against the postponement. According to information from the relevant services, the list of votes scheduled for tomorrow is quite long. Mr President, like Mr Lannoye, I was surprised yesterday evening to hear that the vote on my report at second reading was also scheduled for 12 noon. The political groups have urged me to urge you not to hold the vote at 12 noon, but tomorrow, as the political groups have not had the opportunity to request separate roll-call votes. It was a great surprise that the vote was scheduled for 12 noon. On behalf of many others, I would also like to ask that the vote be scheduled for tomorrow. Mr Blokland, the officials of the relevant departments inform me that your report is already scheduled for tomorrow's vote. I now ask the House whether it agrees to postpone the vote on the Lannoye report until tomorrow. If so, this will be deemed agreed. Annual legislative programme (continuation) The next item is the continuation of the debate on the European Commission's annual legislative programme for 2000. Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, if the citizens of Europe are looking for that Europe, they are looking for it above all in Brussels and, above all, at the Commission. As a parliamentarian, I'm not happy about this, but I have to acknowledge it, at least for the time being and for the time being. But it also means that the Commission faces an enormous challenge. If you want to bring about the major turnaround you spoke of, Mr. Commission President, then you have to start doing it damn quickly.	de
I am also pleased to confirm that I will be attending the next meeting of the Joint Assembly, which will be held in Nigeria in March. The Commission would like to give the Joint Assembly a more important role, particularly in promoting a more intensive political dialogue with our development partners. The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty remains the most important objective of development policy and will always play a key role. However, to develop, countries must be actively involved in the global economic system. Regarding trade with our development partners, the Commission wants to guarantee that any new measure takes into account the specific economic and social constraints of ACP countries. Ms. Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin systems should be continued. I disagree. This system has not proven effective because, in reality, it benefits very few of the 71 countries. I consider it too slow. Therefore, it is understandable that developing countries welcome the new system because it will be more flexible. With regard to the future accession of countries to the Lomé Convention—for example, East Timor—I can only reiterate what I recently said in the European Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation, namely that the door is open. The applicants themselves decide whether they wish to knock. After that, we will take a position. Regarding Cuba's application to accede to the Lomé Convention, the Commission notes that, according to its recent statement, the ACP countries support Cuba's application. The EU has always considered that a constructive attitude towards Cuba is appropriate, as reflected in the EU's common position. However, it must be acknowledged that the negotiations will be difficult. As for Côte d'Ivoire, I can report that the total amount of EUR 28 million has been repaid, as agreed after the financial irregularities were verified. As for the budgetary financing of the European Development Fund, I can say that this is currently being reviewed. The Commission is in favor, but we cannot provide any further details on the timing or procedure at this stage. Regarding Article 366A, I can say that during the negotiations on a new partnership agreement, a new procedure for dealing with violations of human rights, democratic principles, and the rule of law was introduced. As things currently stand, following the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty, Parliament will be informed of all decisions on the basis of Article 300, and the Commission will continue to respect Parliament's decisions in this matter. There are no plans to use the assent procedure in Parliament in connection with such decisions. This would require an amendment to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty. Finally, a comment on the South Africa Agreement, which the rapporteur also mentioned. I am pleased—I almost want to say happy—to be able to inform you this evening, at the end of this debate, that the South African President has today promised to resolve the outstanding issues, as proposed to South Africa by the EU Council of Foreign Ministers last Monday.	de
"(Parliament adopts the legislative resolution) Report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr. Di Pietro, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council act concluding the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union (9636/1999 - C5-0091/1999 and SN 5060/1999 - C5-0331/1999 - 1999/0809(CNS)) Before the vote, Madam President, I should like to denounce the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. I believe that in these matters of the third pillar, in these conventions that are so important for the construction of this area of freedom, security and justice, it is unacceptable that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council is not here today. And then, Madam President, I would like to discuss the problem of translations. I'll give just one example because we don't have time, but this is a case in which translations are very important because they are all very precise legal concepts. In Amendment 83 in Italian, which is the original, it says that ""il minore deve essere assistito da una persona di sua fiducia o da un perito o legale externo."" This ""legale externo,"" in the French version, becomes a ""avocat neutre,"" and I don't know what a ""avocat neutre"" is. I think it's a contradiction in terms. But, in the Spanish version, the lawyer disappears; there is no longer a lawyer. Madam President—you have said this several times—this is a very serious problem. In this matter, I believe that legal linguists will have to do very thorough work to arrive at a reasonable version. I completely agree, Mrs. Palacio Vallelersundi, this is not the first time this has happened, and it is indeed very worrying. We will study this problem and check all the translations. Madam President, I just wanted to join Mrs. Palacio Vallelersundi's before the vote begins to say that I deeply regret the Council's absence from this debate, when such important votes are being held on the Third Pillar. I would like to ask you, Madam President, to express to the Council our hope that it will attend votes like this in the future. I fully agree; I am aware that its absence is unusual, and I will convey this. Regarding Amendment 31, Madam President, I would like to add that in the sentence—I will read it in French, which is the version I have here at hand—s'il est exigé par le droit de l'Etat membre requis ou requérant que la personne donne son consentiment. Add the words ""par le droit de l'Etat membre requis ou requérant"". (Parliament adopts the legislative resolution) Madam President, I just wanted to say that, in the heat of the previous situation, I forgot to tell you that, in the last paragraph of my report on the deficit, in the Spanish version, there is an error: instead of saying that ""we consider the proposal to be correct"", an ""s"" was left out and it says ""the proposal does not seem correct"", which is exactly the opposite. That was the point, nothing else. Motion for a resolution (B5-0132/2000) tabled by Mrs Bonino, inter alia, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the Commission communication on the five-year strategic objectives"	es
This must contain minimum requirements regarding the age and characteristics of ships for access to Community waters and ports, as well as a general principle of environmental liability that allows for a clear definition of the liability of individual actors, particularly charterers, and severe penalties for infringements. The Commission must ensure the coordination of information activities, must not shy away from disputes over the negligence of certain major ports or shipowners, and must place the issue of flags of convenience at the heart of the negotiations with Malta and Cyprus. I would recall that the Erika was registered in Valletta. However, Member States must not shift their own responsibility onto the Union either, because the safety of all depends on the precision and effectiveness (and therefore the means) of port State control. We must and will be particularly vigilant in the coming months to ensure that the victims, who undoubtedly bear no responsibility for this disaster, are fully compensated by the perpetrators, and that this time the lessons of maritime safety are truly learned from the oil spill, thus deterring those responsible for it once and for all from endangering the lives of our coastal communities. The most effective prevention is to threaten every potential perpetrator with severe financial penalties. Katiforis report (A5-0017/2000) We agree that fishing is one of the economic sectors with the greatest interest in protecting the marine environment. However, it must be taken into account that many causes contribute to damage to the marine environment: pollution and contamination by oil tankers and other maritime traffic, industry, the pressure of human activity on coastal areas, and, of course, unregulated fishing. However, it should be emphasized that small-scale coastal fishing is a good example of how fishing can be reconciled with sustainable development that is not destructive to the marine environment. We believe it is possible to reconcile a fishery management policy based on the conservation of the marine environment with the interests of the fishing sector. To do so, however, it is important to take into account the interdependence between income from fishing and increased fishing effort. Consequently, the Common Fisheries Policy must adopt measures and provide appropriate financial resources to safeguard the income of those who depend exclusively on fishing, particularly during periods of stagnation or reduction in fishing. This underlines the importance of the proposals we have put forward with this objective in mind. The Commission communication sets out a series of objectives and proposals, stressing the need to continue efforts in the areas of control and surveillance, to adopt new technical measures regarding the selectivity of fishing methods, to monitor the application of legislation, and so on. In its communication, however, the Commission simultaneously reveals that it does not consider itself in a position to enforce compliance with these legal provisions. There is no lack of existing measures and appropriate means, as the Commission has at its disposal a whole range of binding regulations, measures, and decisions (of international and Community origin) in the areas of fishing and the protection of the marine environment.	de
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of strengthening control over the European Central Bank because I am in favour of its independence. But politically, control must be established appropriately. It is also a matter of establishing the Commission, Council and Parliament triangle in the area of foreign and security policy, an area where everything has so far been far too concentrated on the Council side alone, and of paying particular attention to primitive crisis management measures, for which the powers lie solely with the Commission. All of this has not been sufficiently included in this general concept. We must examine whether changes are necessary to this end within the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference. The Portuguese Presidency of the Council has also stated that it will initiate discussions on this subject with a view to considering an extension of the mandate. I would also like to point out another important point. The debates we are having these days, for example, on the government of a European country, nevertheless show that we must establish that the European Union has an intellectual and moral orientation and aims at the rule of law, the Community and the common good and that binding fundamental rights must therefore also be incorporated into the Treaty because this will constitute an important stabilizer. I ask those who still have great reservations in this area to ask themselves whether the time has not come to perceive this connection and to show the necessary courage to achieve the necessary progress in the field of fundamental rights. The European Union does not need – or almost does not need – new instruments, it does not need new powers. What it needs are the instruments that allow it to use its powers. That is why we must ensure that the instruments function in such a way that we can carry out, on behalf of the citizen, the tasks that are already formally entrusted to us by the Treaty. I believe that this is where the efforts of this Intergovernmental Conference should be particularly focused. If we manage to make progress in this area, we will also be able to consider the historic mission of enlarging the European Union. This is where the decisive emphasis must be placed. I am convinced that, under your leadership, dear Presidency of the Council, this element will evolve in a positive way. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you will have understood from listening to various speeches that the idea of placing trust in the Portuguese Presidency, of not making its work more difficult by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference, strongly prevailed, not without contrast, within the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and among the chairmen of the political groups in this Parliament. I can assure you that it was not easy to do so last week in the committee that I chair, but ultimately, we decided to bet on the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this bet.	fr
"Dialogue on Europe: Challenges of Institutional Reform The next item on the agenda is the Commission's communication - ""Dialogue on Europe: Challenges of Institutional Reform"". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is currently in the process of debating this matter and its work is far from being completed today. I have therefore come to speak to you, as indicated on the agenda of your Assembly, about a new initiative that the Commission is proposing to provide its response, which is not the only response, to a major challenge that must mobilise all the players in European integration, first and foremost of which are naturally the parliamentarians that you are, but also the Commissioner that I am, but also the ministers who sit on the Council and the national parliamentarians and I would even add the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European integration. This morning, in the long debate I attended alongside President Prodi, many of you spoke about the democratic deficit and the distance between us and the European institutions. In saying this, I am not just trying to ask the question - one of you said it very clearly and forcefully - who does what? And the least we can do is ensure that citizens understand who does what between our different institutions. The question is also immediately what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future, particularly with the countries that will join us. So, this democratic deficit also concerns us and that is why, the very day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference, during which I will have the honour of representing the Commission alongside Mr Prodi, and working, I repeat, in close confidence with your two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, we decided, a short while ago, within the College, to launch ""Dialogue for Europe and on Europe"", to take our part in this direct contact with the citizens. All the Commissioners have committed themselves, each time they have to go to a country, and not only to their country of origin, to a region - for my part, this happens three or four times a month - to dedicate a moment of their schedule to a direct dialogue with citizens, not only with the elites or institutional leaders that we usually meet, to also establish direct contact, in a university, in a high school, in a factory, to go and meet people, answer questions and listen. This will therefore be the part that we will play, as you yourselves will play, in this necessary effort, this burning obligation, which consists of reducing the democratic deficit, that is to say the distance of citizens from what we are doing. We wish to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States, in liaison with the European Parliament. We will make a regular summary of it, so that the state of opinion is properly measured and we can adjust or redirect it. We also wish to conduct it in consultation with national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organizations, socio-professional circles and the media. Opinion leaders, political groups and parties, European and national parliamentarians, elected representatives, as I just mentioned, of local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee and civil society organizations, and academia will be involved."	fr
I can tell you, Mr President, that the Bureau has decided in principle to publish a register on the internet in which Members must declare their financial interests, and the Quaestors are examining the legal aspects involved. However, a decision is expected shortly. (Parliament approved the Minutes.) Reform of the Commission The next item is the Commission communication on the reform of the European Commission. I give the floor to Commission President Romano Prodi. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in July of last year, I solemnly made a commitment to reform the Commission here before you. I would like to briefly recall what happened in July: the crisis in the previous Commission had led to its resignation; I had just been appointed President of the Commission, and you had approved my appointment. The culmination of this was my commitment to reform the Commission: a radical reform that must lead to a veritable revolution in the way the Commission works. Today, this commitment has finally been fulfilled: the reform is presented to you here, in a well-structured White Paper just adopted by the Commission. I would like to emphasize that, in this case too, the Commission has decided unanimously, with one voice. In brief, what are the main focuses of this reform? First, defining political priorities and, through the targeted allocation of resources, translating them into concrete actions. This is the core of the system, because with the help of priorities and the targeted allocation of resources, policymakers will be able to assert their leading role and fully assume their responsibility. To this end, we have developed a mechanism entirely new in political programming: a system that enables the Commission to establish annual political guidelines, then, on these basis, organize the budgetary procedure, set concrete objectives for the Directorates-General, and—crucially—monitor the relationship between available resources and assigned tasks. From this perspective, activity-based management is the key tool for ensuring the alignment of objectives, activities, and resources. The second point concerns human resources. They are the backbone of our actions: staff are our true capital, the Commission's capital. These staff possess extremely high qualities, which, precisely because of our recruitment procedures and criteria, are rarely – or even never – found in the individual administrations of the Member States. This impression, which I gained upon taking over the Commission Presidency, was confirmed in my daily work. At the same time, however, I have noticed a very poor mood among the administrative staff: whereas they were once proud and happy to belong to an institution admired by all sides, they are now demoralized by months of criticism. All of this must change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform. Recruitment policy, career development, mobility, disciplinary procedures – all of this will be governed according to completely new criteria: greater consideration of individual merit, credible and, above all, verifiable evaluation systems, ongoing training, and greater responsibility for managers. We will take action in these areas. The third point, which is also quite delicate and has played a significant role in the crisis we are currently experiencing, is financial management.	de
"Mr President, speaking last, I have the privilege, Commissioner, of telling you that this House is largely in favour of your initiative and has shown that it has complete and, in my opinion, entirely justified confidence in the way you are steering this ship. But, since we are in the same boat, we want to row too. This is why I believe it is absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue to reach a safe harbor, to fine-tune and qualify this very important reform. The many ideas that have been put forward in this House could be divided into three broad categories. Firstly, some Members, and in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, are concerned about whether this new system of legal exceptions will be fully compatible with the Treaty. I share their concern and believe that we must examine this aspect. Secondly, there is the question of legal certainty for businesses. It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for producing legal certainty. We all agree. But it is no less true, and all the groups in this House have repeated this, that the European industrial fabric is a fabric of small and medium-sized enterprises and that the Commission often plays a role of auctoritas, of legitimation, of legitimacy, of the internal market. In this regard, I would like to express my opinion on the remarks made by Mr. Karas. There have only been nine rejection decisions. But here, I will speak from my experience as a lawyer. How many times does a lawyer with two companies and a project not change that project, faced with a Commission orientation given ex ante, to ensure that it complies with these competition rules! This is an aspect that must be taken into account. Thirdly, there is the problem of the uniform application of Community law. On this point, there is nothing to add to Mrs. Thyssen's excellent speech. While biodiversity and cultural diversity are, in my opinion, a good thing, the same cannot be said for the diversity of application of the law, of what constitutes the essential core of the internal market, namely, competition law. This point still needs to be refined. Only some countries, such as Germany, have a specialized jurisdiction. Perhaps this is an avenue worth exploring, but we must explore others. What we cannot do, Commissioner, and I would like to end with this, is to lay ourselves open, to provide weapons to those who present the European institutions as a matter for the big, the powerful, the rich, and not for the citizens, the small and medium-sized enterprises, who would find themselves subject, in the worst case scenario, which will never materialise because sufficient measures will be applied to avoid this situation, to courts handing down dissimilar judgments, very late and without any real possibility of controlling the situation other than by doing what the French call ""the obstacle course"", namely waiting I don't know how many years for the Luxembourg Court, which, as we know, is currently saturated, to deliver its judgment."	fr
I believe the Italian Prime Minister raised this point during your meeting on February 24. Can you tell us your position on this subject? Mr. President, Europe has been jolted awake by Bosnia and Kosovo. The European Union is finally realizing that it cannot afford to constantly let the Americans take the political and military initiatives. The decision to establish an autonomous peacekeeping force is excellent. However, if Europe wishes to be able to intervene militarily in critical moments, a flexibility clause must be included in the Treaty. Mr. Solana can play a decisive role. He is not crazy, I can assure you! He is a passionate and competent man. The only question is whether this accumulation of functions does not exceed the scope of his powers. Mr. Solana is not only Secretary-General of the Council but also Secretary-General of the WEU, High Representative for Foreign Policy, and Head of the Planning and Early Warning Unit. Does Mr. Solana still find time to sleep, Mr. President? Frankly, I find this accumulation of functions unacceptable from a democratic point of view, especially since Mr. Solana was not democratically elected: he is a senior civil servant who is not accountable to any parliament. His situation threatens to overshadow Commissioner Patten, as we have seen once again today. Clearly, as the European Security and Defence Policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are becoming less and less involved. I find this situation equally unacceptable. Of course, everything must be done to improve the effectiveness of European policy, but this must not lead to undesirable concentrations of power. Solana must keep Europe's eyes wide open without falling asleep himself. Mr. President, the European Union was created above all to guarantee peace, and I am pleased that Commissioner Patten and Mr. Solana have also repeatedly emphasized this. We have also opted for joint development through democracy, cultural diversity, and tolerance. Yet today, we are powerless in the face of the misfortune in Chechnya and indifferent to the wars taking place in Africa, in a large number of countries with which we nevertheless have ties since they are former colonies. They are, in part, our ACP partners. War is the continuation of decadent underdevelopment. We intervened militarily in Kosovo after being unable to prevent a war from breaking out in the former Yugoslavia. Today, we are unable to maintain peace there. This is why the European Union lacks credibility. I do not believe, Mr. Solana, that we will be able to restore this credibility through military means. As representatives of the European Free Alliance, we all come from nations and regions that have never been at war with a foreign country but have always had to defend themselves against their aggressors. We are very sceptical of your current plans for the rapid formation of an armed force, not because we are opposed to a European defence, but because such defence must and can only result from an effective and democratic decision-making process.	fr
With regard to the type of projects to be supported, the focus should also be shifted from small-scale, revenue-generating projects, which are difficult to monitor, to investment projects where the benefits are most often obvious. This will meet calls for greater transparency in the use of funds and successfully counteract the temptation to place an unnecessary, long-term burden on local tax revenues in areas where such projects are carried out. It will also demonstrate how seriously Parliament takes the call for such reforms. If these changes are adopted by this House today, I believe they will represent another crucial step towards achieving the historically significant objectives for which the funds were originally established: providing financially sustainable support to disadvantaged areas in the European Union, where living standards must be raised to a level of dignity not through handouts but through concrete assistance. I call on the House to approve these changes. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report, which has been drafted with such diligence and care. There is no doubt that the European Union's structural policies and cohesion policy are the essential instruments for creating the conditions for growth and reducing economic and social disparities in the regions. Despite the measures taken so far, these disparities are still quite pronounced, and in terms of unemployment, even unacceptable. In order for the objectives of these policies to be achieved as fully as possible, they must be coordinated and implemented on the basis of well-considered and sensible guidelines. Let us not forget that, if these policies are effective, they will also be visible to European citizens, who will see an immediate improvement in their quality of life! Let us also bear in mind that the remote and island regions of the European Union deserve special attention, because their geographical location places them at a significant disadvantage in terms of economic and social development—unless, of course, the Commission intends to build bridges or submarine tunnels to connect them to the European mainland. Finally, let me say that structural policies as a whole must be made more flexible so that they respond to changed conditions and thus to the new challenges and opportunities that the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best, will bring. Mr President, Mrs Schroedter's report undoubtedly contains many important points, and I congratulate her on this. However, we should pay more attention to the direction and results of the Community's regional policy. Here are a few problems in brief: the enormous level of mass unemployment is not only not being reduced but is becoming even worse as a result of structural policy. Agriculture and agricultural regions are suffering irreparable damage as a result of the regional policy being implemented, which is having disastrous consequences for employment in rural areas and the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South. Regional imbalances within the Member States are increasing at an alarming rate. The data from the sixth report clearly show that regional disparities have increased considerably over the last ten years. Almost no attention, if any, is paid to the enormous problems of the Union's island regions, where deficits in infrastructure, transport, communications and energy are leading to a continuous exodus of the population.	de
Based on this firm position, we also believe the time has come to call for increased efforts by the Commission and the Member States on behalf of those currently drowning in Mozambique. The one million euros made available is completely inadequate for the needs estimated by the Mozambican government at $65 million. The time has also come to demand greater effectiveness. We hope that the debate held this early afternoon, the Commissioner's knowledge of the situation in Mozambique, and Mr. Nielson's visit will lead to greater efforts by all sides in aiding Mozambique. Mr. President, the situation in Mozambique is extremely dramatic. Every day, every hour of delay costs many lives. Only a few helicopters are available to rescue tens of thousands of victims. The water is rising inexorably. Famine and epidemics are looming. It seems as if the whole world is watching helplessly. The question is whether the Commission is reacting quickly enough. To be honest, I have my doubts. Commissioner Nielson left for Mozambique today. That may be quick by European standards, but perhaps very late given the emergency situation in Mozambique. The European Union, unlike a number of Member States, has so far pledged only a very limited amount of support. What options does the Commission see for offering rapid, effective assistance? What might emergency aid and reconstruction support look like? What can Commissioner Patten say about international coordination to date? Why was it not possible to offer rescue operations with a larger number of helicopters at an earlier stage? The international community could certainly also help Mozambique with generous debt relief. Not only because the country is pursuing relatively good policies, but above all because the extent of the human suffering absolutely demands it. Mr. President, all the reports and images reaching us testify to the scale of the tragedy affecting Mozambique. Hundreds of thousands of people have been torn from their homes, numerous deaths, a lack of food and drinking water, and destroyed homes and crops. And all this in a country that is one of the poorest in the world and therefore lacks the slightest resources to provide the affected populations with the speed they need. It is therefore essential that the European Union and the relevant Member States intervene to provide swift, unplanned assistance to this country and its population. As you know, the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Nielson have left for Mozambique today, given the seriousness of the situation. We are pleased about this. But even more than their presence there, it is urgent that a short- and medium-term action programme be adopted and implemented without delay, in cooperation with the Mozambican authorities, to guarantee the assistance required by the situation. It is precisely in this spirit, and in the conviction that swift and extraordinary action is now required, that I wrote to Commissioner Nielson today, before your departure, in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, asking him to meet us immediately on his return to inform us of the situation and, in particular, of the emergency measures which the European Union has already taken or which are still planned.	de
"In the future – and this is already the case today – pensioners will have considerable sums of money at their disposal. Unlike young people who are penniless, older people have accumulated capital that they want to make grow, and they are therefore interested in this directive. If national governments attached importance – as the European Union attaches in this directive – to multiplying the money earned during working life, the explosive problem of pensions would have already been solved. Mr Bolkestein, as Commissioner, you bear a very great responsibility for the future of older people and pensioners, a future that I hope will be better once we have finalised this directive, which will be very soon, as Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi have proposed. Mr President, first of all, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to express my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Olle Schmidt, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which is responsible for the matter, as well as to the rapporteur, Brian Crowley, and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, whom I would like to thank for their detailed and important work in refining and broadening the proposals. Since the approval of Directive 85/611, the investment fund sector has undergone a long process of development, and it is now important to modernise the rules. The new proposals aim for the highest level of investor protection, which is a prerequisite for the market integration that follows the introduction of the euro. Given that the average European family invests its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions for prudent management – and I want to stress this point – prudent management in terms of investment policy and risk spreading. The two proposals form a coherent whole. The first proposal expands the number of instruments in which an ""undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities"" - a UCITS - can invest. As has already been pointed out in this House, UCITS are among the major players in modern capital markets. Their presence offers a large number of traditional investors the opportunity to participate in these markets, taking into account the principle of risk spreading and adequate supervision. By allowing diversified forms of investment, individual investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques. The second proposal expands the role that these important intermediary institutions can play on the European Union's capital markets with regard to the development of the investment fund sector. If we allow the establishment of branches and the establishment of certain services on a cross-border basis, these institutions will finally be able to exercise the freedoms granted by the Treaty of Rome, of which they have been deprived all these years. The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and will take up many of its ideas. The Commission will take up amendments – and I am using the numbering in its most recent form – 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 to the first proposal and 23, 28 and 32 to the second proposal, as these are very useful clarifications and improvements."	fr
Finally, I would like to emphasize that it is also worth taking note—since this was one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency's program—of the statement that it is necessary to enhance development policy within the framework of European Union policies, and particularly within its foreign policy. We believe this is absolutely essential, otherwise we will fail to implement any consistent action in terms of policy coherence, if we are unable to give development policies the prominence they should have as an instrument for affirming the principles and values that shape Europe's integration into the international system. To achieve this, it will be necessary, at the right time, as I have emphasized, to change the paradigm or leave behind the postcolonial paradigm so that development policies acquire a European dimension. I believe in this regard (and some interventions have also indicated this here) that the adoption of the new Convention replacing the Lomé Conventions is an important instrument for renewing a new dynamic in the approach to cooperation with such an important group of countries of the South at a time when the considerable instability surrounding international negotiation processes such as those surrounding the first round of negotiations in Seattle is worthy of mention. In many of the contributions to this debate, I seem to sense a certain degree of frustration. I have made a statement before you on behalf of the Commission, which, in my opinion, provides a useful basis for this debate. We will provide you with more detailed information that directly addresses all the issues relating to coherence. This debate is not new. We are currently working on this issue in the Commission, and once that work is completed, I will report on it, as many have requested the report on coherence. I have no doubt that, as a result of the growing political attention to these problems—something clearly reflected in today's debate—it will be easier for the Commission and DG Development to put coherence at the forefront of our work programme. This also requires the introduction of other new mechanisms into the Commission system, which may well include, as some of the political groups in Parliament have suggested, the establishment of a special working group with cross-departmental representation and the establishment of a kind of coherence watchtower in the Commission. I have read—and heard in the debate—that coherence is being used as a kind of one-size-fits-all panacea. It seems to me important to maintain coherence as a defined and relatively clear discipline that seeks to remedy inconsistencies where they actually exist, and there is no doubt that they do in our case. Much of this is due to genuine disagreements between the sectoral groups in each Member State, as has been said quite frankly in this Parliament: people tend to identify more or less with their spheres of interest, which is legitimate, moreover.	es
"If the IOPC Fund ceiling is insufficient, and it is clearly underestimated, it must be increased. Our resolution calls for this. If the increase is insufficient, the polluter will have to finance the balance. It would be particularly unfair to see an oil company, whose profits this year amount to ten billion francs, refuse to compensate 100% of its own victims, the vast majority of whom are small businesses and employees. The affected populations, Commissioner, are waiting for concrete signs of solidarity at European level. Our resolution calls on the Commission to take the necessary measures to help repair the damage caused to the fisheries sector affected by the consequences of the disaster. Blue Europe, the CFP, must show today that, beyond the constraints it imposes on fishermen, solidarity is not a word it ignores. The European Union must also participate in the restoration of environments in the affected wetlands and coastal zones, whose biological value is of interest to the entire Union. Mr. Fischler has just told us that he would welcome France's requests, and I welcome this. We have a driving role to play in this essential issue of marine pollution. Twenty years after the Amoco Cadix disaster, laxity and irresponsibility still reign supreme in Europe when it comes to maritime safety, with the fruits of new oil spills. This time, inertia must not prevail. A general framework for maritime safety must be quickly defined, respecting the principle of subsidiarity, and this vicious spiral of widespread irresponsibility must finally be brought to an end. Mr. President, the economy of the Western Atlantic is devastated, oiled by the Erika's fuel. Fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, tourism professionals, local and regional authorities are growing impatient while waiting for aid and treatment of the wreck, which apparently is still leaking and constitutes a veritable time bomb. Europe, which inadvertently eliminated the budget line ""natural disasters for the benefit of member states,"" must react. React first in the name of solidarity, but also in the name of its share of responsibility for this umpteenth oil spill. Indeed, citizens have difficulty understanding why Europe accepts what the Americans refuse and why Europe, usually so quick to legislate on environmental matters, has so far ignored maritime safety. Europe must legislate as soon as possible and shed full light on this shipwreck. But in the meantime, the Commission must urgently mobilize European funds to help the affected businesses, treat the wreck, clean up the coastline, increase waste storage capacity, ensure its treatment or recycling, and establish a research program on oil recovery at sea. Finally, the Commission must reinstate a substantial budget line, ""natural disasters for member states,"" and make the affected departments eligible for Structural Funds. What is the Commission's opinion on these proposals? What decisions have already been taken and those does the Commission intend to take?"	fr
This is why radical reforms are needed and therefore a broader agenda for the IGC. The Finnish Presidency has only listened to the governments that are in favour of the minimalist approach, while unfortunately ignoring the opinion of Parliament. Portugal has the opportunity to learn from its Finnish predecessor what should not be done. It is vital that Parliament and the Commission are involved in this IGC. In many areas, these two institutions share common interests and positions. An effective assessment of this common commitment must, in any case, coincide with Parliament's right to approve future Treaty changes. Of all the priorities, this is the most important. What is the Commission's opinion on this? This also means that the President of our Parliament and the other two political representatives must be able to participate on the same political level as the Commission, and not only in a working group. There is no reason why directly elected representatives of the citizens should be relegated to a second place compared to the Commission. Radical reforms are a commitment that we must make to the new Member States, but also to ourselves. If we allow Europe to weaken as a result of enlargement, we will sink into our own political swamp. Mr President, for days now I have not understood this Parliament which seems to have a masochistic taste for self-mutilation. After having limited its participation in the IGC to a paltry two seats on its own initiative, Parliament is today refusing to complete the agenda of the Conference. Indeed, whether through weakness or stupidity - and neither of these alternatives seems glorifying - this House is rushing to give its opinion and is thus renouncing the only instrument of command given to it by the Treaty, namely, renouncing the requirement to be given a complete agenda before it can take a decision. Why should we vote on this opinion tomorrow, 3 February, under the urgent procedure, when we could wait until the opening of the session in Strasbourg on 14 February and, from a position of strength, impose a complete and therefore coherent agenda on the Council? It takes a good deal of hypocrisy to mask the weakness we are displaying today. It takes hypocrisy to bitterly regret, in the resolution, that the agenda of the IGC is not up to the challenges of the future, when we impose short deadlines on ourselves with culpable naivety and prevent ourselves from imposing a more ambitious agenda. If at the end of the IGC democratic gaps are highlighted, the blame will be on the political groups that wanted this hasty participation. Whether we like it or not, the decision-making body is now moving to the fifteen Member States, because Parliament has extinguished the only light that allowed it to shed some light on the discussions. I therefore appeal to the Members of the vast majority of Parliament - who decided in November that the future of Europe deserved a broader debate than the residue of Amsterdam - to arm themselves with good will and to take action with their governments to convince them of the need to expand the IGC, a possibility that is also envisaged in the resolution of the Helsinki Council.	it
Mr Poos, I beg your pardon. There has been some lack of clarity precisely on the point which you asked. With regard to MEDA, Malta and Cyprus can participate in regional programmes, but not in country-specific programmes, because the incomes are too high. Thank you very much, Commissioner Verheugen. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday. Question Time (Council) Question No 1 by the Honourable Member (H-0022/00): Subject: Control of access of oil tankers to Community waters In connection with the accident involving the oil tanker ERIKA off the coast of France, which resulted in an oil slick, what measures does the Council intend to take to control the access to Community waters of oil tankers flying flags of convenience which do not comply with Community safety standards? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council addressed the consequences of the sinking of the oil tanker Erika the previous month. On that occasion, the Council, while also taking on board the emotion of public opinion over the disastrous effects of that event, expressed its concerns about the safety of oil tankers and the environmental protection associated with it. The Council was not insensitive to this type of problem and to the need to adopt additional measures in this regard. On that occasion, it was stressed how important it was for the Council to adopt new measures both at Community level and in the context of its work with international organisations. As is well known, Community legislation currently requires port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign ships, including those flying flags of convenience, and to detain them if they fail to comply with international standards. There is a 1995 directive on this matter. As regards the future, the Council noted that the process of reflection under way within the Commission should shortly be concluded with a communication on the safety of oil tankers and with new proposals aimed at strengthening controls and the qualifications of inspection bodies. It also provides for the need to strengthen the very structures of oil tankers that call at Community ports. This issue is being followed by the Council of Transport Ministers and, therefore, I can inform you on behalf of the Council that we will not fail to give top priority to the proposals that the Commission, as everything indicates, will present in this area, which we believe to be essential, in terms of environmental protection. Naturally, Parliament will also be called upon to express its opinion on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to codecision. I am pleased that the Council considers my question as a subject for reflection. The President-in-Office of the Council comes from Portugal, a country directly threatened by a situation of this kind. If we reflect too long, however, it could happen that, between now and next summer, an oil tanker in similar conditions runs aground off the Algarve and destroys the Portuguese summer tourist industry; that, if this is the fate, the sea currents carry the pollution all the way to the island of Madeira - because they are going in that direction - and also compromise tourism in the Canary Islands.	it
The Commission insists on the need to first examine these applications from the point of view of their safety and efficacy before granting an authorisation. I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission's proposal and to await the independent proposal for a new directive on additives in food before addressing broader issues. I would like to address some of the specific issues that have been raised during the debate. First of all, with regard to the comments made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I wish to assure you that we will amend the procedure for authorising genetically modified additives in Directive 70/524 on additives and not in the novel food directive. This is a directive whose subject matter concerns raw materials more specifically than additives. The text referred to by Parliament comes from the directive that was adopted in 1998. However, the vertical legislation of Directive 90/220 on the manner of carrying out environmental risk assessment of GMOs has since been amended and is still being amended today. It is now in Parliament's second reading. I am convinced that we should wait for the final version of Directive 90/220 and, more specifically, Article 11 thereof. Reference has also been made to the question of whether this proposal could create a risk of monopolies being established. Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi have raised this issue. I would just like to make a few comments on this issue. First of all, this project has been under way since 1993, and therefore it cannot be said that it has taken any other producer of goods by surprise. Indeed, any such applicant can still submit their application relating to a particular product. I also wish to point out that the Commission has never approved any application for authorisation of GMOs for inclusion in additives. Mrs Roth-Behrendt referred to the question of the appropriate legal basis, namely whether that basis should be Article 37 or Article 152. Again, I repeat what I have said previously on this point and assure her and the House that it would be highly inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify a measure taken on the basis of Article 37 by simply excluding from the provision any reference to public health. This is an issue that has been considered on at least two occasions by the European Court of Justice, which has established the legal criteria for situations identical to the present one, which require consideration of the appropriate legal basis when presenting a legislative text. The Court's case law appears to be quite explicit on this point. As a general comment on the amendments suggested here, particularly with regard to the problem of the legal basis, it would, in my view, be inappropriate to base the legal basis on Article 152 in these circumstances, as that would almost certainly run counter to the objective criteria that have been set out by the Court. A number of you - Mr Nicholson in particular - have referred to the problem relating to labelling.	fr
The adoption of this report will have serious consequences for European agriculture if the concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen, for example, cannot exceed the basic values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a value close to zero is set for pesticides in the aquatic environment. European farmers will, for example, no longer be able to produce bread wheat with a high protein content for making bread. This will result in the relocation of agricultural production to other countries outside the EU, and this will entail significant social and employment costs. I cannot accept the parts of the Water Directive that concern these points. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is a precious resource. Millions of people do not even have access to clean water, a prerequisite for survival. We should therefore not be surprised that water is the basis of wars. The capitalist world is also positioning its pawns to gain maximum control over water supplies. In this matter, there is rarely any question of any general interest or solidarity. Europe is therefore faced with a difficult task: to bring together Community water policy, fragmented in terms of both objectives and resources, into a more coherent legislative framework. I must admit that in my country, Flanders, too, there is still a long way to go. Only recently, the Commission rapped us on the knuckles about this. Any sensible person wants this framework directive to be used as a sword in the back of politicians who are currently guilty of failings. In this respect, the common position is a farce, an informal work, a real affront to the OSPAR agreements. We are faced with an implementation deadline that can be extended to 34 years. My children will then be older than I am now. Admit it: this is not serious. Tomorrow, we could vote for a weak and informal framework that will poison our children's future. Or we will vote for the amendments from my group, the rapporteur, or the Environment Committee. This is just to conclude. Over the past few months, we have been under enormous pressure. What is striking about this issue is the enormous pressure coming from the Council of Ministers. In my country, this was done by both the Flemish and Walloon administrations responsible for the environment. They opted for the weak common position rather than the more ambitious stance of our Parliament. I really wonder if this approach is known to the Green environment ministers in my country. Dear colleagues, fine words are no longer enough. We must resolutely change course. In tomorrow's vote, we can clearly show that Europe is committed to a responsible and forward-looking water policy. This can only increase our credibility. The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.	fr
"The Group of the European Liberal and Democrat Party adopted a position on the internal disintegration of the Union, approved last November, in which it proposed the creation of a system of concentric circles in Europe, ""the onion model."" In its resolutions on the next IGC, Parliament must fully address the issues of internal differentiation and flexibility. Enlargement and the very achievements of integration will be threatened if we are unable to create the system of concentric circles proposed by the Liberal Group. My colleagues, Mrs. Frassoni and Mr. Onesta, have already spoken, with a certain skepticism, on some aspects of the matter at hand. I wish to add my voice of concern regarding the issue of subsidiarity, not only between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Member States and their own autonomous communities. This is an issue that has not received the attention it deserves, and there are many aspects about which we should be concerned. Let me draw attention, in particular, to one of the repercussions of enlargement for this Parliament. The limit of 700 was set as the maximum number of Members who can constitute a Parliament in which the Assembly's deliberations are viable. If we apply the current principle of diffuse proportionality—six seats for each State and one more seat for every half million inhabitants—we will have a situation where Luxembourg, with a population of 367,000, will have more Members in this Assembly than Wales, which is partly an autonomous community of the United Kingdom. Scotland, with a population of 5 million, currently has eight seats in this Assembly; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen. What will happen if we maintain the limit at 700, if over time a 26% increase in population is added, and then approve the Commission's, in my opinion, ill-considered proposal that there should be a European list of candidates? What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here? It will become totally invisible! In such circumstances, Members of this Parliament should not be in the least surprised if, in these negotiations, the people of Scotland and other similar countries ask whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States integrated into existing ones. In Scotland, more and more people support this point of view every day. Mr. President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is, without a doubt, nothing new. It has been said many times. But this time it is true: we have launched—and this is something extraordinarily positive—the single currency, and enlargement lies ahead. The question is: are we going towards enlargement prepared or not? Are we for enlargement without going deeper, or are we for enlargement by going deeper? That is the debate, and that is what any discussion regarding the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda, and its method is all about. It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlargement by going deeper. And that's dangerous for enlargement. Dangerous for any prospects for political union, and certainly difficult for the public to understand."	es
It seems to me that there is a broad consensus of opinions; however, the Rapkay report contains some comments that we should consider very carefully. I will highlight only two of them for the sake of brevity. The first concerns a further increase in transparency. This Parliament knows the extent to which all of us consider the issue of transparency in competition policy to be important, and I personally have, since the first day, September 1, 1999, when I appeared before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Mr. Rapkay, with regard to the international dimension of competition policy, I can confirm that the Commission is ready to provide Parliament with a report on this subject, to which Mrs. Randzio-Plath has also drawn our attention. Within this context, I can say that we maintain very satisfactory bilateral relations with our counterpart authorities in the United States, Canada, and Japan, and that we are working to ensure the emergence of a genuine competition policy within the World Trade Organization. I also warmly thank you, Mr. Jonckheer, for your report on the seventh report on State aid in the European Union. I will not address the issue of codecision here, but not because I do not consider it important. It is of very significant institutional importance that obviously goes beyond the specific issue of competition. Consequently, I do not have the right to comment, and this issue obviously belongs to the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference. Regarding your suggestions, Mr. Jonckheer, you already know that my services are—despite their limited, albeit highly qualified, resources—working very actively on the development of the State aid register and the State aid indicator. I await with great interest the results of the seventh report, the planned timeframe of which is: creation of the services now, in January, and approval by the Commission in March 2000, to assess whether the latest trends are confirmed. Mr. Jonckheer, Mr. Thyssen, and Mr. Gemelli have referred to the candidate countries' readiness regarding competition in general and State aid. I can only say that we are working actively and specifically with them. They are preparing; they all already have competition laws and are establishing the corresponding authorities. Regarding energy and, above all, environmental concerns, which, as you know, are also mine, I can say that we are finalizing the review of the incorporation of State aid into the environment. I would also like to highlight, in the context of State aid problems, the issue raised by Mrs. Riis-Jørgensen, among others, regarding the recovery of unlawful aid. In April 1999, the Commission approved a new procedural regulation introducing specific rules on recovery. Over the next few months—I can assure you of this—you will see how seriously we intend to take these rules. Finally, Mr. President, I would like to warmly thank Mr. Langen for his report, which is more sectoral in scope but no less important in terms of its contribution.	es
"This should be enough to demonstrate the topicality of the issue, but we can also mention the next Summit between the European Union and the OAU, finally set for next April, in Cairo. It should be added that any analysis, even superficial, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something, indeed a lot, is wrong in terms of North-South relations, including those between the European Union and the least developed countries. Suffice it to think that the number of so-called least developed countries has increased from 25 to 48 in the last thirty years and that the latter, although they currently represent 13 percent of humanity, account for only 0.4 percent of world exports and 0.6 percent of world imports; or the unfortunate circumstance that public development aid, promoted by rich countries, has decreased by about 23 percent. Moreover, the recent cuts to the Community budget made in this sector for the current financial year are part of this trend, as well as constituting a negative and incorrect political signal. The unsuspecting Mr Camdessus, still Director of the International Monetary Fund, stated in his speech last Sunday at the opening of the UNCTAD - and I quote - that ""the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other"". He was obviously referring to the aid granted by the most advanced countries to the developing countries. It seems like a joke, given the source from which it comes, but the statement was actually made: I heard it myself. It is an observation that does not seem far from current reality and leads me to reiterate the need to rethink and relaunch North-South relations on new foundations, or the need to re-examine the role of the European Union in this area, because the promotion of a new, more just and equitable world order cannot and must not cease to represent a strategic objective of the Union; it is therefore essential to reflect on the current globalisation, taking into account the essential orientations and dominant interests, in particular the very serious negative effects that it causes in developing countries. The conclusion of a new agreement with the ACP countries is a fact. This is in itself a positive development, especially given the pressure that was exerted to end it and the fact that even several Member States were opposed to continuing down this path. We will have the opportunity, in due course, to analyse in more detail the exact terms in which the agreement was defined. However, it is certain that, despite the fact that it contains new and innovative elements, the European negotiators were rather cautious and kept below the proposals that we had formulated at the time. The novelties are constituted by some features of political relevance in the new partnership agreement. The latter is undoubtedly the result of a complex negotiation in which both sides made substantial concessions, which is true as far as the European Union is concerned, especially in the areas of good governance and trade. But above all it was the result of the strengthening of the ACP group, which, it seems, has found a new spirit since the Seattle Summit. I would like to stress, in particular, that a new way of addressing problems, particularly in trade matters, seems to be emerging and that an appropriate approach in this area is truly indispensable."	it
It is therefore likely that there are many forms of life out there, and that many of them are more advanced than ours. Remembering that the first television programs from Earth are now in space 50 light-years away, far beyond the nearest stars, I invite you to imagine with me what the life forms among the stars might think of us when they look at us. What do they see? They see a beautiful planet, full of life, but they see that its atmosphere is polluted and overheated. They see that forests are being cut down and deserts are expanding. Of living creatures, they may see that many animals are treated cruelly and that rare ones are disappearing forever. How do they see the currently dominant species, that is, us? Well, they see that the planet's resources are distributed unequally. They see fighting over territory, they see medicines that can cure diseases, but not in the parts of the world where they are most needed, schoolbooks, but not in the least developed parts of our planet, where 50 percent of the world's population never makes a phone call in their entire lives. How do they see human relationships? They see us killing each other. They see us limiting each other's freedom. They see an endless series of local wars. They see some of our children being drafted into the army as soldiers, or treated as prostitutes or slaves. They see men and women, people of different ages, minorities, people of different skin colors, people of different races or religions, immigrants, even neighbors, being treated in a discriminatory way. We all know the situation. The United Nations Convention on Human Rights of 50 years ago was an attempt to correct the situation. We should honor it, and I think we do. Only in Europe are human rights enshrined in law. Here in the European Parliament, some Members do not want the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is currently being debated, to become enforceable by law. I say: shame on you! Human rights should be enshrined in law in every country in the world. That is what we must strive for. As Commissioner Patten said, much remains to be done. Finally, if you were to ask me: What if there were no life among the stars, and we were alone? - an equally disturbing thought - I would say: Don't you think we have a responsibility to ensure that our children behave properly, before we let them go and populate other planets? Mr President, human rights are universal, indivisible and interconnected. Many people know this famous slogan by heart, taken from the conclusions of the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights in 1993. It is a good thing that this is so. But we must ask ourselves whether the European Union's human rights policy reflects the unitary and homogeneous vision expressed by the slogan. We must also ask ourselves whether the European Union has a human rights policy or not. With this last question I am not referring to the effort it takes for Member States to coordinate their foreign policy positions with one another and to form a common front against human rights violations in other countries such as China, for example.	it
"What I see all over Europe is people drinking Coca-Cola, eating hamburgers, wearing baseball caps, watching Hollywood movies, and often doing all of these things at the same time. Now, I don't believe that protectionism and regulation are the way to defend Europe's culture, but I do believe in lending a hand whenever we can. This is what the Culture 2000 program aims to do. Therefore, I say to the Council of Ministers: do some real monitoring of this program. Is what we are doing enough? And I thank Mrs. Reding for the support and help she has provided so far and encourage her to continue her good work; we are on her side. Madam President, I also want to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, Mr. Graça Moura, and the Commissioner, Mrs. Reding, for their contribution to the achievement of this program. The ""Culture 2000"" program was finally formed at the end of last year in the conciliation between Parliament and the Council. The final agreed solution can be considered acceptable, considering that the adoption of the program required unanimity by the Council. It is to be hoped that the next IGC will decide to extend the qualified majority to the cultural sector as well. It is truly unusual that legislative provisions, the processing of which is subject to the codecision procedure, require unanimity by the Council. This framework program for culture replaces the current Kaleidoscope, Ariane, and Raphael programs. I would especially like, once it is launched, to fully utilize all the possibilities the program offers for the translation of books and literary works. I hope and believe that, despite the avalanche of new technologies, literature will retain its status. We need the depth that literature conveys in a world of superficiality and inconstancy. Furthermore, literature is of great importance in transmitting our cultural tradition and increasing our mutual understanding, as well as in safeguarding linguistic richness and plurality. In this context, I am very pleased to report that shortly after the official launch of the Socrates and Culture 2000 programs, which will take place in March in Lisbon at the Council of Ministers meeting, the Portuguese Presidency will organize a meeting to reflect on the situation of public libraries. I hope that this meeting will also encourage the Commission to actively take public libraries into account within the framework of the fifth Information Society Program. Madam President, Commissioner, Mr. Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, in a sense, this agenda has come full circle. Today we have spoken a great deal about Europe as a community of values, tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive attitude toward the enlargement process, openness, and respect for others. Policies on youth, education, and culture are an important instrument for ensuring respect for these values, for ensuring citizens' trust in the European Union, and for ensuring the credibility of the European Union in its eyes."	es
"Unless, of course, one doesn't care about equal access to postal services for everyone, but instead focuses exclusively on the capital utilization conditions for companies in large urban centers. Members of Parliament, however, should be representatives of all citizens, and that means they are obliged to think in economic terms, not business terms. In concrete terms, this means for postal services: First, the issue of employment must take priority. I have nothing against liberalization and privatization, but the premises must be right. Second, it must be guaranteed that there will be no reduction in services for citizens. Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this danger certainly exists. Mr. Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country where prices have risen significantly more sharply after liberalization than in all other member states of the European Union. That is also an effect that can arise. We must take precautions to prevent that from happening. Third: First, universal postal services at an affordable price for every citizen, everywhere, remain essential; second, maintaining a uniform price for all Member States; and third, daily mail delivery and collection on working days. Regarding the question of value for money for the respective weight categories of mail, further price reductions can be considered; the Post Office itself says so. It is not necessary to stay above 300g, although analysis suggests that a minimum weight of 150g must be guaranteed for it to even be worthwhile. I believe that today's discussion was appropriate and important in this respect, so that Mr. Bolkestein knows how this Parliament stands and can take things into account from the outset. Mr. President, we are in the first phase of the revision of Directive 97/67/EC on postal services, and further liberalization would, I very much fear, lead to a significant reduction in services provided in the public interest. At Mr Bolkestein's hearing, my colleague Véronique Mathieu expressed the wish that impact studies be carried out on each proposal immediately after its announcement, so that the effects of the planned liberalization would be known before the legislation was adopted. What is the current state of affairs? Are the results of these impact studies available? As you know, we EDD MEPs, along with other Members, defend rural life, that is, the preservation of jobs and social cohesion, which is reinforced by the provision of a high-quality universal service. I would love to be able to say that, based on the examples we see every day in my country, in my very rural region, we can move on to a further phase of liberalization without any concerns. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and if the European directive is applied together with the French 35-hour law, which changes the working time criteria—for example, 1,700 mail items per workstation per hour, compared to the current 1,400—then in rural areas, either the opening hours for the public will be reduced or certain post offices will be closed. This already represents an unacceptable reduction in the public service. I have my local newspaper here, in which I read: ""The Postal Directorate informs the public that as of January 3, 2000—this is very timely—the last collection will take place at 3:45 p.m. and not 4:30 p.m. as before."""	de
"I therefore believe that this point, which in itself justifies a broader revision, must be urgently placed on the agenda of the IGC. In our view, the central questions that must now be asked regarding the convening of an intergovernmental conference for the revision of the Treaties go far beyond the controversy raised here concerning the size of its agenda, the possibility of formulating proposals for new subjects to be included on it, or the level of Parliament's participation. The important questions, in our view, concern the possibilities and objectives of the IGC, but also the topics that will be debated there. We have doubts about its possibilities because the objectives in view are far from being in line with the planned enlargement to which reference is constantly being made. This is particularly evident from the content in question, especially with regard to the points left unresolved in Amsterdam – which heralded the subsequent formation of unacceptable directorates – but also with regard to those relating to the second and third pillars, which are beginning to take shape, particularly in the direction of an undesirable militarization of the European Union. These are several of the essential reasons why we are not in favor of the motion for a resolution we are now considering. The European Parliamentary Labour Group abstained from the final vote on the Leinen-Dimitrakopoulos report. The text is overly ambitious, and MEPs from the British Labour Party believe that the IGC should prioritize the Amsterdam leftovers in preparation for enlargement and should not extend beyond these objectives. Important work is currently underway in terms of reform, and this must be the priority for the time being in order to allow for the consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions. Expanding the agenda and drastically revising the Treaties would risk destabilization. The key element in this text, as amended, is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be included in the Treaties. In our view, this would create a complex legislative burden, and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter explaining to citizens what their rights are. Our priorities should be: the number and responsibility of Commissioners; the weighting of voting in the Council; the extension of qualified majority voting in areas that will benefit the UK and Europe (but not Treaty changes, defense matters, border controls, or taxation); and the extension of codecision in all areas to which qualified majority voting is extended. Beyond this, we are concerned that the suggestions for ""flexibility"" and enhanced cooperation are not appropriate at this time. The Amsterdam provisions have largely remained untested, and increasing emphasis on opt-outs could weaken the EU at a time when enlargement is being considered and candidate countries are being asked to sign up to the single market and other EU legislation. (SV) In order to influence developments, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude to the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference than is reflected in this resolution, which is too concerned with disappointment and negativism about the decision taken by the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999."	fr
Our report, as you know, Commissioner, advocates the application of the codecision procedure to basic legislation on state aid. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my part in today's debate concerns the Steel Aid Code. It concerns state aid which has been granted in Europe on the basis of this code and which the Commission has examined. In 1998, there were a total of 27 cases, on which the Commission has drawn up its own report. The ECSC Treaty will soon expire. That is why we must above all deal with how steel aid is to be managed in future. Parliament welcomes the decisions of the European Commission set out in the report, including that of requesting the repayment of funds in certain cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty. At the same time, the competitiveness of the European steel industry is also the subject of the recent Commission communication, which we have not yet discussed in Parliament. As in other areas, the steel industry is also subject to a general ban on state aid under Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty. According to this article, state aid is essentially incompatible with the single market. Exceptions are only permitted in clearly defined cases. Under Article 88, the Commission is required to monitor state aid. The main case in 1998 was the equity injection of EUR 540 million into Preussag in Germany. Member States must also notify the Commission of their aid plans. The rules in force for the steel industry were introduced on 18 December 1996. They provide for the possibility of granting aid to the steel industry only in certain clearly defined cases. These include aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social aid to encourage the closure of steel plants and aid for the permanent closure of uncompetitive companies. In addition, there is a special regulation that grants up to EUR 50 million to one Member State, Greece. As can be seen, the practical management of the Steel Aid Code over the years has led to problems that are not fully explored in the report. From Parliament's point of view, it is important to talk today about derogations to be applied once this Steel Aid Code has expired. A relaxation of the current fundamental lines of the Steel Code is a possibility that cannot be ruled out. Nobody wants to see a race for subsidies in Europe. This would seriously undermine the single market despite the consolidation of the steel industry in recent years. Parliament therefore considers it essential to amend the Steel Aid Code, also in view of the unequal treatment feared by the industry; the Commission will have to submit new legislation to the Council. It is known that the Council has so far refused to approve this new legislation. This is also due to the thesis that, once the steel aid code has expired, without the annoying control of the European Commission, one can go back to doing what one wants.	it
The van Hulten report represents progress, but it is not enough. Furthermore, we must clarify our roles in the area of financial oversight. The Court of Auditors must check to what extent this or that element of the EU's financial functioning might be incompatible with the regulations, but it is not its role to check whether expenditure complies with the objectives set. It is the European Parliament that is responsible for political evaluation. Our job is not to hunt down criminals - that is OLAF's. So tell me, for example, which national parliament obtains all the documents relating to preliminary investigations! I would therefore like to repeat, with all the stubbornness I can muster, that the provision on access to information and documentation must be significantly improved compared with the draft texts that have been seen on the internet, otherwise this fight will lead nowhere. Mr President, I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteur for his report. I am pleased to be able to address him in Dutch now that Mr Van den Berg has done so, otherwise I would probably have had some qualms. I think that this report is a significant improvement, particularly in terms of the amendments. I am a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and in our country, a rapporteur is always proud to receive 100 proposed amendments because that means he has raised an interesting issue. I believe that this is the case here, although I think it would be excessive to dwell on these 100 amendments for too long. I would add that our coordinator in the Committee on Budgetary Control is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has therefore made a very considerable Spanish contribution to this debate. Mr President, I think that one of the important points that has been mentioned is essential: the proposal to appoint a rapporteur for the Standing Committee on Public Administration Control. This is a proposal of the utmost importance. I am only surprised that the Socialist Group wants to eliminate this proposal by means of another proposal from Mrs Morgan, because she does indeed want to delete it completely. I do not really understand what she is getting at. On the one hand, we hear all sorts of praise for the rapporteur and, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a kind of scorched earth strategy, both on this particular point and on a number of other important points, which has the effect of emptying the entire report of its substance. I do not know whether the aim is to meet Mr Kinnock. I certainly know Mr Kinnock. Mr Kinnock is willing to listen to our expectations, but is just as willing to deviate from them if he sees fit. I do not really think it is useful to resort to extreme tactics like scorched earth. Finally, there is the question of civil servants. I do not entirely agree with Mr Haarder, in fact. I share the view that the section on civil servants is completely inadequate. This is because, firstly, no emphasis has been placed on the importance of public service in general and, secondly, because there are all sorts of proposals, the question of whether they are sensible and whether they will bring about any improvement is very real.	fr
The Community can intervene to connect local stakeholders so that they are not, in effect, reinventing the wheel in their own region. We have an important role to play in the Community, in the European Union, in this regard. SAVE is the only Community-wide program aimed at promoting the rational use of energy. It focuses on non-technical elements, helping to build energy-efficient infrastructure; and the objective of this program is to create an environment conducive to investment and energy efficiency. We must also realize here that there is a niche in industry for energy savings. We have heard a lot about the competition problems with renewable energy, but energy efficiency saves money at the company level, it saves money everywhere, in fact, and therefore, it should not create problems. We can all support this principle. I must say that, as with motherhood, although we offer our support, we sometimes do very little in a substantial and concrete way to help mothers or those involved in energy conservation. We could do much more given the major commitments we have made to reduce CO2 and greenhouse gases and reduce dependence on energy imports. We are not undertaking the kinds of actions that our citizens want. We are not making the connection so that citizens can actually do something concrete, whether at home, in the office, or within industry, to support actions to combat global climate change. If we could communicate this, it would be very interesting to do so. I would like, once again, to thank everyone who has contributed to this reconciliation process. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur for this proposal, as she has contributed, with the collaboration of other parliamentarians, to achieving a result that is ultimately very reasonable, even improving certain aspects of a Commission proposal and, of course, of what the Council had accepted, at the very beginning, from a budgetary point of view. As Mrs Ahern has very rightly said, both the budget for the SAVE programme and that of the Altener programme are more symbolic than ever, because the burden is borne by the countries, the EU states, the regions, or even, in some cases, the municipalities. But in any case, just because its volume is relatively small does not mean that it no longer has the important symbolic value implied by the fact that there is a will throughout the Community to support this type of action which contributes to us actually meeting our Kyoto commitments and, moreover, to us achieving the diversification of our energy sources, the security of our supply and, in the case of SAVE, to us moving towards lower consumption, greater efficiency in the use of energy, thus contributing to achieving the objectives set. Furthermore, with regard to these programmes, namely, the SAVE programme, greater efficiency and economy, and the Altener programme, renewable energies, there is a very great technological challenge to be met, which from an economic point of view, can give rise to important opportunities for industry and also for job creation in our countries and, consequently, in the Union as a whole.	fr
"I will now briefly review the five areas where the most important changes are made. First, the changes to the definition, in ESA 95, of the concept of the institutional sector of general government; this is important because public debt refers to that which will be totalled by the general government as a whole. The lack of precise criteria for its definition would produce ""deviations"" in the estimates of the public debt of the various Member States. Second, public debt or, where appropriate, surplus is equivalent to the balance called respectively of financing needs or capacity of the general government sector of ESA 95. Third, public investment is equivalent to the gross fixed capital formation operation according to ESA 95 of the general government sector. Fourth, public debt is defined according to ESA 95, as are the flows or interests arising from such liabilities/assets. Fifthly and finally, the aggregate to which public debt will refer will be the gross domestic product at current market prices, estimated on the basis of the definitions of the European System of Accounts 95. Ultimately, it seems to me that the Commission's proposal represents a correct and concrete adaptation of the criteria established in the European System of Accounts 95, and I therefore approve it in its entirety, in the terms in which it was presented by the Commission. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say first of all that my group welcomes this proposal, as it makes the statistical basis for an Economic and Monetary Union oriented towards stability and real growth more uniform, immediately comparable and precise. The various sectors have already been mentioned. For me it is crucial that statistical data are from now on more reliable and comparable. This is necessary because we must be able to trust each other, and this applies to the various institutions of the European Union and to all the Member States within the Monetary Union. An adjustment of the procedure is important for two reasons: firstly, for the single market. Reliable and immediately comparable data and statistics are generally of great importance for an accurate representation of the situation and developments in the single market. Secondly, for economic and monetary union. The 1993 regulation on the application of the protocol must be harmonised, at national and regional level, with the methodology of the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts. This is essential for the correct and reliable recording of deficits. This adjustment will allow a more precise assessment of the deficits and debt situation in the Member States. At a technical level, it will have very concrete repercussions on the actual position of the States, since the data are automatically adjusted in line with the government deficit. I also find it positive that the estimate of the deficits for the financial year 1999, which should be published in March 2000, is already being carried out in accordance with the new ESA, which bases the analysis on consolidated and economically relevant aggregates. I would also like to take this opportunity to briefly appeal to all governments and political parties to do everything possible to never have to initiate the excessive deficit procedure."	it
"I'm telling you this myself, as an entrepreneur who is certainly interested in this. But a system like this cannot function! It only works if it is coupled. Let me give you an example: The European Union was right to subsidize the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg, even though only 700 of 5,000 jobs remain. But those are competitive jobs, because this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany. Anyone who now essentially jeopardizes the production of this steelworks by demanding back the subsidies granted at the time is not only endangering the steelworks itself, but is also endangering an employer in this region on whom, of course, small and medium-sized enterprises also depend. This, of course, cannot be the European Union's competition policy! If we want competition, then we must achieve this coupling between economic necessities and business prerequisites. This is also the only chance of building regional economic cycles in underdeveloped regions in this way, which will lead to people having social security and increasing purchasing power. This means we must give far greater consideration to demand-side economic policy than just supply-side economic policy! Mr. President, never since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 have I encountered a report with such anti-Irish undertones as the report by Mr. Jonckheer we are debating today. I would like to quote from the report verbatim: ""State aid per employee... is highest in Italy, Germany... and Ireland, but Ireland clearly comes first when state and Community aid from the Regional and Social Funds are considered together."" I believe the rapporteur is simply juggling the numbers here. I find it difficult to understand how he can include the Regional and Social Funds in this mathematical equation. I would remind my colleague that the European Union has agreed to the new guidelines for regional aid for the period up to and including 2000. This was merely an extension of the political objectives of completing the internal market in Europe. Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to develop successfully and prosperously. I welcome the fact that after 2000, grants of 40%, and in the case of SMEs and their fixed capital investments, an additional 15%, are planned for companies that locate in Objective 1 regions. I remind Mr. Jonckheer that Irish companies, or foreign companies in Ireland, are separated from the continental European market by two major seas. No other Member State is at such a disadvantage. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, the ban on cartels is the core of a functioning competition order in Europe. The Commission has found the practical implementation of the enforcement of the ban on cartels unsatisfactory; this is initially acceptable. However, opinions differ regarding the solution. The Commission's proposal does not formally deviate from the ban on cartels, but in effect, this proposal is a transition from a ban subject to authorisation to a licence subject to authorisation. This represents a transition from the prohibition principle to the abuse principle. I and other colleagues strongly reject such a drastic change in the system. I do not accept that a practical implementation problem should be the reason for a change in the legal system."	de
It is therefore also extremely important that this cumulative condition can be accepted. In conclusion, I would like to repeat that, in my opinion, our colleague Mr Di Pietro has done an excellent job in presenting a report which offers, within the limited framework of existing possibilities, all the guarantees for the preservation of individual human rights and fundamental freedoms. However, if we want to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we must work even harder on judicial cooperation. Mr President, my group is pleased that we are reaching a convention aimed at regulating the daily practice of mutual assistance in criminal matters. The purpose of this regulation is to define the mutual rights and duties between States or citizens or in the relationship between citizens and the authorities. The proposal before us is complex because, although it deals with agreements between Member States, it nevertheless has far-reaching consequences for the relationship between citizens and the authorities. However, the Council's proposal is woefully inadequate in the area of legal protection. In the words of rapporteur Di Pietro, the proposal even displays colossal shortcomings. The convention allows for chain requests for mutual legal assistance that involve the authorities and criminal justice systems of other Member States in the proceedings. The way this is regulated means that no judge can control this entire chain. Additional measures are therefore necessary, such as requiring judicial police officers to comply with any request for testimony in a criminal case involving documents of their own origin. Another point that my group has a problem with is that the Council's proposal flouts the principle of proportionality. In any case, no limitation of the scope is put forward. The convention is therefore not only applicable to the fight against serious and organized crime. It is not even mentioned anywhere that it is limited to criminal law. It is therefore not unthinkable that the Union will soon be fighting mosquitoes with cannons and that citizens' rights will go up in smoke. Mr President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, which we are examining today, contains the bare minimum for effective and rapid collaboration between the various judicial and investigative bodies. It concerns notifications, the exchange of information, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of property, testimony by videoconference, investigative and undercover activities, telephone tapping, and so on. This is the bare minimum on which we can agree, and I hasten to add that if certain amendments were to pass, such as, for example, Amendments 32 and 81 or 70 or 71 revised, the entire Convention would be reduced to a simple exchange of notifications or information. Therefore, it should be thrown out, and we would vote against it. I hope that the common sense of the Members of the various groups will encourage them to reject these amendments. The fact that this issue was not the subject of a framework agreement and remained at the level of the conventions constitutes a defeat for Parliament.	fr
It is right to focus on the access of education systems and public administrations to the Internet and their use of the Internet and to create the so-called 'knowledge society', just as it is right to draw attention to access to risk capital and to promote small and medium-sized enterprises by other means. In its proposal for the summit, the Commission has set quantitative targets for the development of employment, unemployment and female employment. In addition, the Commission has also set the objective of reducing poverty problems in Europe over the next ten years in its proposal. I think it is important to place emphasis on common targets, because the policies of different countries in these matters will and must be different. Some Member States of the Union - without mentioning any and without forgetting any - are faced with high youth unemployment, while in others, for example Denmark, youth unemployment is very low and there is a real war going on between employers and training institutions to grab hold of young people. There are differences in problems, systems, cultures and traditions between countries and therefore the choice of instruments to achieve the common goal of employment growth and reduction of social exclusion must also be different. The formulation of employment policy ensures this through the process of exchange of ideas and experiences decided in Luxembourg and although there are many common features of the problems we will have to face in the coming years on the front of social and employment policy, there are also common challenges, and some of them each country will have to solve on its own, but it is equally important that in finding a solution to social problems, countries do not hinder each other, but instead work together and inspire each other. I believe that it is important to pursue a common goal, but it is equally important that each country retains its own sovereignty and responsibility in the formulation of social and employment policy and that there is a certain competition between the systems, which can act as a catalyst for dynamics and development in the formulation of social and employment policy. Mr President, as a representative of Flanders and on behalf of what I would call the nation-regions represented in the European Free Alliance, I was struck by your plea for a strong European approach aimed not so much at strengthening the power of the fifteen Member States, but rather at strengthening their cooperation. You spoke of the existence of fifteen distinct public opinions, but in reality there are many more, as there are enormous differences within the Member States. As a Belgian, do I need to remind you of the differences of opinion between Flanders and Wallonia? Or between the former East Germany and West Germany? There is also the danger of a division of public opinion as a result of globalisation. Just as we once had the gap between rich and poor, we now see the gap emerging between those who can keep pace with the developments in our society and those who cannot and remain on the margins.	it
We expect the Commission to take this into account in its proposal for a social action programme. Social convergence is also a necessity in view of enlargement, partly to strengthen the social model, partly to counter the risks of social dumping. The Commission should consider drawing up a special action programme on social policy in the context of enlargement. The discussion in committee was constructive. Many amendments were tabled, but it was still possible to reach a consensus on the report. The amendments now put to the vote in plenary have been reduced to 15, which shows a considerable convergence of views. Some of the amendments are now being re-tabled after being discussed in committee. I intend to reject them. I am also against the amendments tabled by the TDI Group, as I do not believe they add anything to the report. My group, however, intends to support Amendment No 14 tabled by the Liberal Group. I think it is a good proposal. It is certainly similar to Amendment No 14. 1, but Amendment No 14 is better. In conclusion, I would like to say that the European Union is not just about trade cooperation. The European Union is also about employment and social justice. Social policy plays a very important role in creating a citizens' Europe. With this report, Parliament intends to make its contribution to strengthening the social dimension in the European reality. We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and take it into account in future social policy. The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present such a strategy. Mr President, I warmly congratulate Mr Andersson on the report on the modernisation of social protection that we are debating today. As coordinator of the Group of the European People' s Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am pleased with the compromise that we have managed to reach thanks to Mr Andersson' s strong commitment. I am also pleased that he has taken up a report which I signed in the previous parliamentary term and that the broad lines of his text partly reflect those of mine. The Andersson report refers to a communication published by the Commission in June 1999, the ultimate aim of which is to deepen cooperation between the Member States and the European Union in the field of social protection. From this perspective, important partial objectives are defined: firstly, the promotion of employment and the concern that work should guarantee a fixed income; secondly, the recovery and economic sustainability of pension systems; thirdly, the promotion of social integration and, fourthly, the guarantee of high-quality health services at reasonable costs. In order to achieve these objectives, it is essential to pay close attention to aspects relating to equality between the sexes. I believe that the Commission communication should be welcomed, not least because these four factors, if not the main terms of public debate, are particularly felt by many citizens of the European Union.	it
Diplomatic pressure is only effective when it is backed by credible economic and military threats. The rest is just wishful thinking. Member States must therefore either allocate more money or make a greater commitment to modern mobile units so that our soldiers have the best possible equipment to protect themselves; we will then welcome the decisions taken last Monday in Sintra. The third heavy burden on your shoulders is ensuring parliamentary control. This must first and foremost be exercised at Member State level. No soldier may be sent on a mission without the consent of the national parliament. It is therefore wrong to talk about a European army. It is a force composed of national units. What is new is that it is fast, well-prepared, and has an effective joint command and modern equipment. There is also, of course, room for a certain right of scrutiny and control on the part of our Parliament. You are often our guest, whether here in plenary or in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and we consider you to be someone who is both able to talk and listen. Finally, I would like to express my delight with you at the incredible unity of thought and the speed at which this new cooperation is being established. Some of us met the Portuguese Minister of Defence yesterday. He was as delighted and positively surprised as you are that we were able to agree on so much. Remember that there are also non-aligned countries around the table. We share your joy as long as we do not move so quickly as to create a breach in transatlantic cooperation. This is something I would like to emphasize again, and finally, I would stress that the objective of all this is to become so credible that, when we exert economic and military pressure, military intervention never takes place. That's the goal of all this, and it is therefore also important that you work in collaboration with Mr. Patten, because it is military, economic, and diplomatic pressures that, within the Community, will put a barrier to encroachments on the territories surrounding us. Mr. President, Mr. Solana, we are all big children. You are making grand plans, and in your roadmap to 2003, there are 60,000 soldiers. It's extraordinary what we decided to do in Sintra in 2004, 2005, and 2006. But in the year 2000 for Kosovo? You spoke with Mr. Gil-Robles; I received an email from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pristina at the moment. He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been assassinated in Pristina. He treated Roma, Albanians, Serbs, and that's unforgivable in Kosovo. He was murdered, he has three children. We need police officers in Kosovo today! We need soldiers who don't follow a doctrine.	fr
What we need is better internal control and more dismissal options. We must change the Staff Regulations and disciplinary procedures, and not least, the practice. Article 52 of the Staff Regulations, on dismissal for serious omissions, is currently barely applied. We should do a thorough clean-up and clean up our own backyard rather than demand the construction of new, great institutions. Mr President, we all want to contribute to the fight against fraud in Europe. But the question is, what contribution is the European Union making to this? The answer is that we know shockingly little about it. The Tampere Summit was about fighting crime. Everyone was supposedly satisfied with it, but there was hardly any progress on the substance. European anti-fraud legislation is not in force because, as has already been pointed out, the Member States do not ratify the treaty texts that are presented. So, a lot still needs to be done there. But what needs to be done? Two things, and Mrs Theato's report shows this clearly. First, the same sanctions must apply to European fraud in all Member States of the European Union. Harmonization in this specific area. Secondly, a European Public Prosecutor's Office must be created, with two tasks: first, to assist and support national prosecutors in prosecuting European fraud cases, and second, to ensure judicial oversight of Europol and OLAF, because these two investigative agencies can currently operate without legal oversight. We needn't be afraid of the European Public Prosecutor's Office; everyone around me sees only ghosts. It really is a positive thing. Just like Europol. Europol, police cooperation, is not above national police services, but serves as a forum for the exchange of information between police departments. That is precisely what a small, limited European Public Prosecutor's Office must do, only not at the investigation stage, but at the prosecution stage. Parliament is in favor. The Committee of Independent Experts is in favor as is the same. I appeal to the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to also commit to this measure. Mr President, I would like to focus on the issue of Corpus Juris. I wholeheartedly support the observations made by Mrs. Morgan on this matter. The Corpus Juris was established without any public debate or participation. A European Public Prosecutor's Office, committed to the continental European principle of investigation, with Europe-wide decision-making powers overriding national law, would have a lasting impact on the traditional system in Ireland as well as in the United Kingdom. Member States have a right to be informed about the possibility of a unified criminal code and a European Public Prosecutor's Office. When such a plan was first presented, it was stated that it would be limited to cases of fraud against the EU budget. But when the Corpus Juris was actually launched in San Sebastian in 1977—in front of a select audience of 140 legal experts and behind closed doors—the then President of the European Parliament, Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, stated that this was only a preliminary stage and that the intention was to extend EU jurisdiction in criminal matters to all areas of crime. We need a public debate on this issue. Member States and their citizens must be fully informed. The question of a potential threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the United Kingdom must also be addressed.	de
Mr President, I have taken note of your statement and the existence of this joint resolution. Provided the Bureau services confirm that it has been duly tabled, it goes without saying that it will be taken into account. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon. (The sitting closed at 8:14 p.m.) Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting Mr President, I would simply like to announce that there was a terrorist attack in Madrid this morning. One person was killed in a car bomb explosion. My point is simply to reiterate, on behalf of my group, such terrorist acts. Thank you very much, Mrs Fraga. We have already heard of this deplorable incident. Unfortunately, Spanish society is once again being ravaged by murderous terrorism, and your words, as you will understand, resonate with the President particularly given that this sitting is taking place under the Spanish Presidency. (Parliament approved the Minutes.) Resumption of session I declare the session of the European Parliament, which was adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000, resumed. Madam President, please allow me to remind you that tomorrow marks the second anniversary of the Monte Cermis disaster. Two years ago, in Cavalese, Italy, an American aircraft flying from the NATO base at Aviano cut the cables of a cable car during a low-level flight exercise – flying below the altitude permitted for safety reasons – and killed more than 20 European citizens. Since then, the families of the victims, denied the consolation of justice because the guilty pilot was not brought to justice, have been expecting at least prompt financial compensation from the United States. I therefore appeal to the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission to lobby the US authorities for immediate compensation and thus help the victims' families obtain justice. Thank you, Mrs Angelilli, I take note. Agenda The next item on the agenda is the establishment of the order of business. At the request of various political groups and following the conclusion of the Conference of Presidents which has just concluded, I propose that you add to the agenda, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, a one-and-a-half-hour debate on topical, urgent and important issues relating to the Union's response to the intergovernmental negotiations in Austria. If you agree to this proposal, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Seixas da Costa, and the President of the Commission, Mr Romano Prodi, will open the debate. Who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal? Madam President, I take the floor to support the decision of the Conference of Presidents and, just as I publicly criticized the Presidency in January, I now take this opportunity to say, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we consider the statements made by the Presidency on this subject to be appropriate; we share their content, timing, and form. Now, Madam President, it is truly difficult to find a debate more in keeping with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure. This is a topical, extremely important, and urgent debate. Therefore, we believe we must amend the agenda to accommodate it. (Applause) Does anyone wish to speak against this proposal?	de
"That requirement is clearly the single market. To what extent has the single market already been consolidated? I would like to remind Mr. Prodi and his colleagues, who are still here, of the results of the study that the Commission itself carried out among 3,000 European companies. Nearly 40% of the companies in this study still bear additional costs to homologate their products or services according to national specifications. This is a study by the Commission itself. These are classic symptoms of the continued obstruction exercised by national governments; red tape blocks market entry. The Commission's program reflects a worrying complacency regarding the completion of the internal market. We must keep the pressure high in all areas, removing additional barriers, intensifying pressure on Member States that flout single market rules, and, of course, extending it to new areas of fundamental importance, such as financial services. Only on a solid foundation such as the single market can the enlargement agenda be successfully implemented. An enlarged Europe must enhance the Union's current virtues. A single market extending throughout the enlarged Union will be a colossal achievement. I conclude by saying, on behalf of my Conservative colleagues—and we constitute the second largest national delegation in this Parliament—that we are committed to fully supporting the Commission and Mr. Prodi in accomplishing this historic task. Madam President, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of our investiture vote, we gave you an appointment for today. Today the serious business begins, as it is precisely now that we are going to pronounce on your program. Allow me, in the words you have spoken before this House, to focus my speech on what you have called new governance. It makes it an instrument of reconciliation with our fellow citizens. But behind this term ""new governance,"" I believe there simply lies the question of the functioning of the institutions, the question of the functioning of our public authorities, if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority. The articulation between the Union's institutions, the powers of the Member States, and local and regional authorities is all very well. But is this how we will reconcile citizens and European integration? Is this truly how we will respond to the fundamental questions, which are not so much ""who does what,"" but rather ""what we do together,"" since this is what sows confusion among our fellow citizens? In your speech, you mention the challenges that await us: those of globalization, those of enlargement, and, I would add, the future of our social model. That is why my group and I insist so much on this draft charter, because we believe that if we have included the drafting of this charter of fundamental rights in our timetable, it is because we find ourselves at a time of rendezvous with history, where our Union needs to redefine the values around which it has been built within its current borders, but also in the perspective of the future enlargements that we desire, although not at any price. Our fellow citizens expect more Europe from us, but not just any Europe."	es
These concerns are justified. It has been said many times: justice delayed is justice denied. The Commission has every sympathy for the comments raised. For this very reason, I would like to formulate my response as follows. As Parliament is well aware, the Commission is convinced that, without a radical reform, in the short term, the Community judicial authorities run the risk of no longer being able to carry out their tasks within a reasonable timeframe. The Commission has therefore consulted a group of experts to advise on reforms that could be implemented in order to enable the Court and the General Court to maintain the quality and coherence of their case law in the decades to come. The Commission takes note of the request from the General Court to strengthen its staff, but considers that for the time being the proposed transfer of competences should be considered in the light of the study just mentioned. In other words, once the study is completed, the Commission will issue an opinion as soon as possible. Thank you, Commissioner. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00. Exceptional financial assistance to Kosovo The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(1999) 0598 - C5-0045/2000 - 1999/0240(CNS)). I have been informed that the rapporteur will be a few minutes late. I propose that we start the debate immediately, pointing out that the rapporteur will speak as soon as he arrives in the Chamber. Mr Bourlanges, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, now has the floor. Mr President, this is an important and urgent matter. Parliament, at the request of the Commission, is taking a quick decision because it is necessary to spread the news that men and women are dying today in Kosovo simply because the temperature has dropped to -25 degrees and that some people, who work for free, are doing a huge amount of work in order to ensure minimal support. We have therefore received an emergency request, to which we are responding favourably. EUR 35 million has been requested. We agree to grant it and we are calling on the Commission to ensure that, once the decision has been taken, the sums are allocated and paid as quickly as possible. This is macro-financial aid, which is causing reactions everywhere because it does not respect the canons of the free market doctrine which consist in not intervening financially to support an administration. We do not share this opinion, but we believe that it is essential to contribute to the establishment of an administration in Kosovo and that it is not at all absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public officials in the region. It would have been very useful if we had been able to do so in Russia in the 1990s to prevent the dissolution of that State. The second major problem is that we are called to provide assistance, as promised by the donors, but then we are the only ones who pay since the others do not contribute.	it
On the contrary: its draft must comply with the criminal law legislation of each Member State. The intention to achieve a unanimous decision may lead to compromises that do not stand up to this scrutiny. Scrupulous parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament, but above all by the national parliaments, is of great importance. Di Pietro's proposal to delete the current Article 18, which concerns, among other things, the interception of telephone conversations, is understandable but very rigorous. The wording of Article 18 is unclear: it restricts the activities of the intelligence services, but apparently permits the interception of telecommunications by one Member State on the territory of another without prior authorization. In doing so, Member States would make themselves largely vulnerable, and it is doubtful whether sufficient guarantees exist to protect both the state in which the interception takes place and its citizens. Suggested additions, such as repeated references to the European Convention on Human Rights, the rights of the defence and suspects, as well as the failure of Member States to implement the European Convention on Human Rights, excessively bloat the text of the Convention. I recognise the problem, but believe it could have been resolved with a single amendment to the text. Despite certain reservations, the Dutch members of the EDD Group will not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the vote. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a report that is of the utmost importance, not only for its content, but also because it represents a first step towards establishing smoother relations in the field of judicial cooperation. This has taken place exclusively at the level of intergovernmental relations, and European citizens have not been able to discern any concrete signs of the oft-invoked Union citizenship in this area. On the one hand, judicial measures have nothing to do with the Community dimension, but on the other, we are already experiencing a degree of freedom of movement for people from which criminals also benefit. However, according to Article 29 of the Treaty, the Union's objective is to offer citizens a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in police matters and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia. It must be stressed that the creation of Europol is already a step forward, but the next step must now be taken: strengthening judicial cooperation in criminal matters, so as to gradually establish a genuine European judicial area in line with the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice. The aim of this draft Convention is therefore to supplement the traditional instruments already existing in other areas of law and to facilitate their application in the Member States, with a view to improving judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective mutual assistance, while fully respecting the essential guarantees of the rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the law of the Member States themselves and in the European Convention on Human Rights. It is precisely this reservation regarding essential rights, freedoms and guarantees that has led us to support the withdrawal of the proposed text on telephone interception, recommending that the Council propose an autonomous legal instrument to remedy this situation.	de
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I completely agree with you. The problem is not Mr Kouchner, but the legal basis for his action, that is, Resolution 1244. Having said that, I believe that the Union's responsibility, and therefore your responsibility and ours too, is to work towards overcoming the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and developing a future perspective for the entire region. In my view, the lack of a fixed perspective is provoking or encouraging the violence, accidents, and murders to which Mr Alavanos referred. Does the Council intend to raise the question of Kosovo's definitive status? And if so, does it intend to do so in conjunction with a general reorganization of the region, avoiding, as far as possible, the creation of numerous microstates, as some seek, and reuniting the separate parts, in this case Kosovo and Albania? Since the author is not present, Question No 7 lapses. Question No 8 by (H-0796/99): Subject: New INTERREG initiative. In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft communication on INTERREG, entitled 'Promoting urban, rural and coastal areas', the Commission permits the renovation and development of historic town centres by means of a joint cross-border strategy. However, residential buildings are excluded from this. Given that rural areas contain many houses of historic interest, including very small buildings, and given the need, for various reasons, to combat rural depopulation and make rural areas more attractive, does the Council not consider that these objectives could be furthered by also providing financial support for housing projects in the INTERREG areas? Mr President, The Council, and I would even say particularly the Portuguese Presidency, are extremely aware of the importance of the problems to which you, Mr President, referred in your question, and I would like to say that we have always paid the greatest attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas. In this regard, I would like to point out the new aid scheme for rural development, adopted in May 1999, which constitutes the Community reference framework for promoting the sustainable development of rural areas. As we know, this was one of the developments that took place during the negotiations on Agenda 2000 and the treatment of agricultural issues at Community level. Through the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), the aim of this Community support framework is to reverse the trend towards rural degradation, to which you, Mr President, quite rightly refer in your question. On the other hand, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) also contributes, within its remit, to promoting economic and social cohesion by correcting the main regional imbalances and contributing to the development and restructuring of rural areas. In this regard, it should be remembered that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable development and the equally sustainable creation of jobs in rural areas. The combined effect of these Community instruments enables us to implement a development policy for rural areas, which today, moreover, represents a development and support line of the Common Agricultural Policy in one of its fields of action, as well as of regional policy.	de
"Let us say it once again: the European Union's cooperation and development policy is inconsistent. Therefore, on behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group, I call on Parliament, the institutions, and the Commission to finally try to bring coherence to our policy. Mr. President, I consider this debate particularly timely not only because of the importance of the issue of development in general, but also because of its relevance. The Seattle meeting failed, and North-South relations were on display there for even more reasons. The meeting held in that North American city highlighted that globalization entails profoundly unequal and unfavorable outcomes for the poorest countries. At this very moment—and clearly influenced by that failure—the Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is still being held in Bangkok. In the meantime, as has been said, the negotiations that determined the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded. That alone is enough to highlight the relevance of this topic today. And we can also add the upcoming EU-OAU summit, finally agreed for next April in Cairo. But any analysis, however cursory, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something, or even much, is wrong in North-South relations, including between the European Union and the least developed countries. Suffice it to consider that the category of so-called least developed countries has grown, in the last thirty years, from 25 to 48 countries, which now represent 13% of humanity, but account for only 0.4% of global exports and 0.6% of global imports. Or the unfortunate circumstance that public development aid, promoted by rich countries, has been reduced by almost 23% since 1990. Moreover, the recent cuts related to this area in the Community budget for the current financial year are part of this trend, in addition to constituting a negative and misleading political signal. The rather unsuspecting Mr. Michel Camdessus, still director of the International Monetary Fund, stated in his speech last Sunday at the opening of the UNCTAD meeting—and I'll quote—that ""the international community gives with one hand and pulls with the other."" He was referring, naturally, to the support granted by developed countries to less developed ones. Such a statement, which seems ironic coming from whom it comes, but the truth is that he uttered it, I myself had the opportunity to hear it, does not seem to me to be at odds with current reality and moves me to affirm that it is essential to rethink and cast North-South relations in new molds, in particular the need to rethink the role of the European Union in this framework, because the truth is that the promotion of a new, more just and equitable world order cannot - or should not - cease to constitute a strategic objective of the Union, so it is essential to reflect on the globalization underway, taking into account its essential orientations and the dominant underlying interests and, within that framework and in particular, the enormous consequences and the pernicious effects it has for the least developed countries."	es
Finally, his proposal would deny a passport to those companies that do not want to carry out the activities covered by the Investment Services Directive. As regards Mr Huhne's question, he mentioned forward hedging transactions this morning; but such transactions are already permitted under the existing Article 21(1) of Directive 611/85 on UCITS. So what Mr Huhne is asking for is already possible. Mrs Villiers referred to the possibility of improving portfolio management. This too is already possible under the current legislation. I am referring to the same Article 21(1) mentioned in relation to Mr Huhne's question. Mrs Kauppi asks why the Commission has prepared a package of measures divided into two separate proposals. The fact is that the first proposal is essentially about the product, while the second is mainly about the service provider and prospectuses for UCITS. The separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of issues should facilitate the negotiation process in the Council. The Commission must not only listen to Parliament and take its proposals into consideration but, as is well known, it must also deal with the Council. That is why the Commission has presented these two proposals separately. Finally, Mr Balfe complained about the limitations, which in his opinion are excessive, which characterise the entire proposal presented by the Commission. It seems to us, however, that these limitations are justified, firstly, by the need to diversify investments, secondly, by the vulnerability caused by the need to repay investments at any time, and thirdly by the aim of avoiding excessive interference in investment funds. For all these reasons, the Commission believes, also considering the caution that must always be used in this sector, that these limitations are necessary. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 12.00. Mutual assistance in criminal matters between EU Member States The next item is the report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by letters of 3 August 1999 and 3 December 1999, the Council asked the European Parliament, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty, to express its opinion on a draft convention between the Member States aimed at ensuring better mutual assistance in criminal matters. As you can see, therefore, this is a very important project which will actually help the Member States of the Union to equip themselves with a more complete and more homogeneous instrument of mutual assistance. In truth, there are still today, within the Council, some divergences regarding the type of convention, regarding some of the clauses contained therein. Some of these differences have already been resolved, others remain. The spirit of the proposal, however, is to provide legal practitioners - magistrates first and foremost, but also interested citizens - with a valid operational tool for the fight against crime, while respecting fundamental guarantees of defense and the general principles of human rights.	it
This infectious anemia of salmon is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus that decomposes the salmon's blood, thus causing its death. The disease spreads easily through mucilage in salt water, etc. The 1993 directive allows for the removal not only of the diseased fish, but also of all fish from an infected farm, just as if a cow in a herd becomes ill, the entire herd is slaughtered as a precautionary measure. Now, we are being proposed to relax this directive so that not the entire stock is culled, but only those fish reported as diseased. As for the other fish, there would then be time to wait and see what happens, depending on local circumstances. I consider this an extremely dangerous approach. I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to this, because one cannot be satisfied with the claim that the temperature limit of 27ºC provides sufficient protection for humans and therefore there is no danger. But does this also apply to women? There are no studies on human tissue in this regard yet. There is also a risk to the environment, because, as we know, salmon have an incubation period, and consequently, when consumed, they can transmit this virus without themselves becoming ill and therefore pose a danger. Another danger to the environment is that this disease is transmitted to wild fish, as we have seen. For this reason, together with my colleague Patricia McKenna, we have tabled amendments to the Commission's proposals. Mr Piétrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission's proposal, particularly the development of a vaccine and compensation for fish farmers who are forced to cull their fish. The idea of changing the culling policy does not make us very happy. Now, although it has been stated on several occasions that Norway has done a better job in combating the ISA epidemic and that the proposed changes will enable us to achieve a similarly high standard to Norway's, it must be said that there is more than just a difference between Norwegian policy and Community policy. This is a Community measure which also applies to Ireland, where I come from, should similar unfortunate circumstances arise there. There are further differences, namely the approach to inspections of infected holdings, the closure periods, restrictions on the movement of contaminated fish and material, and so on. Before we hastily copy the Norwegian eradication policy, we should try to see whether we cannot contain the disaster by other means. A lot has been said about BSE in the past. For years the Greens have been urging us to tackle the BSE problem. If we had done that at the time, many farmers and the EU could have saved a lot of money. This is also to do with environmental protection, with the protection of farmers themselves, and with the protection of public health. I would like to thank Mr Hudghton for his excellent report on infectious anaemia in salmon and his general support for the measures proposed by the Commission. I would also like to thank all my previous speakers for their contributions this evening.	de
The first is the harmonization of national spatial planning policies and regional development policies. Subsidies are not enough to achieve development when infrastructure or public services are lacking. This is therefore a fundamental question that we must ask ourselves: how can we ensure that the Union's policy is coordinated with subsidiary national spatial planning policies? The second challenge is that of enlargement, which will naturally have considerable consequences in both budgetary and geographical terms. These are two projects that I invite the Commissioner to implement and in which I ask him to involve us. Finally, in this period of natural disasters, I would like to raise the issue of the use of the Structural Funds. We know that it is up to each Member State to redistribute part of the envelopes. We should not, as the Member States tend to want, see Europe disappear completely. Today, public opinion and the press accuse us of being absent, even though we are going to finance a large part of national efforts. I believe we must be able to say this loud and clear. I think we should also establish or require Member States to provide information on European aid whenever it is mobilized to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents. Mr. President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the rise of inequalities in all their forms. For experts on the French plan, for example, the most likely scenario today is a widening of regional differences within each country. However, the Structural Funds have contributed to slowing this process. Our project for a Europe focused on meeting social needs aims for upward convergence of living conditions. Its implementation would certainly imply an extension of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds. In particular, we are proposing a unified capital tax, which would provide funding for funds used to support the harmonization of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level. However, the Commission, which is required to present guidelines, is doing so only reluctantly and vaguely. The report proposed today restores the role of politics. It is one of the steps towards an employment and sustainable development policy. This is what will lead us to vote for it. Mr. President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I believe that in the coming years, faced with the challenge of globalization and enlargement to the East, Europe will need more than ever adequate and precise guidance on the programming and revival of its economy. Therefore, Europe as a whole, and each of the Member States in particular, will have to make the best use of all its resources and capacities, and therefore also the available structural funds. To achieve this, we need a European Commission that, beyond its good intentions, clarifies its guidelines and commits itself as much as possible to monitoring the use of these resources by Member States.	fr
"Furthermore, the way this Council is being prepared is very illustrative of this. First, the degree of seriousness and depth of the document presented in January. Second, the various preparatory conferences, the contribution that both employers and trade unionists are making to this Summit. And above all, the latest contribution in terms of research made at the recent meeting, attended by Nobel Prize winners and Ministers of Science and Technology. It demonstrates the seriousness and attention to content in the preparation of the Summit. But we also support the initiative with regard to the central objective already stated here, because for the first time not only is the issue of employment and social issues once again at the center of the European debate, but it is once again considered possible to ""achieve the goal of full employment."" For many years, many people said that this was impossible, that in the new societies it would no longer be possible. I congratulate you, Mr. President, for bringing this issue back to the agenda without denying social cohesion and values that, for us, are fundamental, because they are not only the foundation of the founding project of the European Union, but also the foundation of our civilization and, above all, of our way of understanding the degree of demand for solidarity among all Europeans. We already said it here in January, and I would like to repeat it: we are not content with this strategic objective being the priority of a presidency; it is only a priority for six months. And we once again challenge the Council and the Commission to include it: not as a six-month priority, but as a goal of the European Union, as important as enlargement or the deepening of the European Union. Only in this way can it fulfill the objective of seriousness with which the Presidency is preparing this Extraordinary Council. Congratulations, Mr. President. Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, and Mr. President of the Commission, I would like to express my delight at the fact that such an active agenda in favor of employment and economic development has been raised for the Lisbon Summit. It is an agenda that emphasizes the need for a strong and dynamic economy and improved competitiveness to guarantee the goal of greater employment in the EU. It is thought-provoking that the EU is so far behind the United States in terms of both research and development of new technologies and job creation. We need to join forces to promote research and development, including research related to information technologies. We need to strengthen the internal market and create the conditions necessary to maximize the benefits of new technologies and develop trade via the Internet. It is right to draw attention to the issue of access to and use of the Internet by educational systems and public administrations and to create what has been called the ""knowledge society."" It is also right to focus on access to venture capital and to strengthen the position of small and medium-sized enterprises in other ways."	es
We demand that this opportunity bring significant changes to our life in society, that democracy also be synonymous with equality between men and women, that the latter not be excluded economically or socially, as is the case today. That values dear to women, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security, and environmental protection, predominantly guide life in the European Union and, if possible, in the world. To achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to intervene against the inertia of a society that has until now been essentially imbued with masculine values. Our experience teaches us that freedom and the ability to decide cannot be begged for, they must be won. Let us continue this conquest and may this new century bring us victory, not over men, nor over anyone: the victory of equality between men and women. We cannot afford to miss a single opportunity. The great challenge now facing all Europeans in general, and women in particular, concerns the new economy and new technologies in the information sector. The Lisbon Summit, which will be held at the end of the month, particularly concerns women. We must increase the employment rate in Europe, which is significantly lower than that of the United States and Japan. To do this, we must put many more women into work and into new jobs, in which the European Union has a deficit. I therefore ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they intend to present at the next Lisbon Summit so that the new economy and the new Europe we wish to build definitively incorporate equality between men and women. Mr President, Commissioner, I welcomed your intervention because you dared to mention the Member States where women's political representation is a success, namely Finland, France and Sweden, but also because you did not fail to mention the States where things are going less well, which is the case in my own country in particular and Greece, a country you forgot to name. I have also heard that very few women are likely to stand on the lists in the next elections to be held in Greece. I believe that this is very serious. I appreciated your intervention because I believe that it is high time that we had concrete means within the European institutions to improve the position of women in politics. This is why I believe it is essential that this Parliament continues to insist on quotas and that this is clearly stated in the resolution. I myself, Commissioner, am a product of quotas, and I do not believe that a single Member of this House can demonstrate that I am less competent as a result. In some of our European countries, it seems that meritocracy remains such a male-dominated principle that women have no chance at all.	fr
"Between 1998 and 1999, loyalists attacked and shot dead 123 people, compared to 93 for republicans. In 1999, 193 cases of legal proceedings were brought against loyalists and 97 against republicans. Since 1 January 2000, there have been six murders perpetrated by loyalists, compared to two by republicans; loyalists have been involved in six serious shootings, including one that resulted in a death, and republicans in five shootings. Mr President, this situation cannot continue and must be remedied. Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam set out an important objective for the Union. A task that all Members, the Council, and the Commission must undertake during this legislative period: the creation, as has already been said, of an area of freedom, security, and justice. The Tampere Council, the driving force behind this objective, proposed some goals, but the five-year period provided for the development of Chapter IV of the Treaty is too long for the urgent solutions that certain problems require. My first thought is that Parliament must not remain on the sidelines of the important decisions that will be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed, particularly since this is a citizens' project, as the Commissioner rightly said. My second thought is that we must move quickly towards the adoption of a common asylum system. We must approve common procedural standards and, above all, put an end to the current confusion between immigration for political reasons and that motivated by economic reasons. The latest laws on foreigners, adopted in my country, Spain, or in Belgium, are a warning and demonstrate that the communitarization of immigration policy must be adopted as quickly as possible. My third thought concerns the Union's external action in the field of immigration and asylum. We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union only wants to defend itself against an avalanche of refugees and economic immigrants. We must focus on a policy of development cooperation with the neighbouring countries of the East and the Mediterranean area, but with rigour, with economic resources and in close collaboration with public institutions, which cooperate to protect citizens whose most fundamental rights are violated or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most basic needs. Finally, with regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, European citizens need to visualise their citizenship. The euro, employment, or even security are not enough for them. They need the ""European soul,"" as a famous Spanish professor put it. Mr President, unlike some of the previous speakers, I would like to return to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino. As Mr Ceyhun said, the words of this trio resonated like music to our ears. As with all music, it must have a beautiful melody and be well orchestrated. Many of us here are looking forward to the next six months with great optimism."	fr
This is particularly evident in France: in the Champagne-Ardennes region, which I represent, GNP fell from 105 to 94% of the Community average, in the Pays-de-Loire region from 95 to 91%, and in Auvergne from 89 to 83%. The Rhône-Alpes and Alsace regions are no exception to this general trend. It is also evident in Sweden and Finland, where unemployment has risen alarmingly in recent years, and in several regions of the United Kingdom. In view of this, it may seem surprising that Objective 2, intended for industrial and rural regions undergoing economic restructuring, was sacrificed in the context of the reform of the Structural Funds in favour of Objectives 1 and 3: it has ECU 22.5 billion at its disposal for the period 1999-2006, roughly the same amount as in the period 1994-1999. The areas eligible under Objective 5b will have to make the greatest sacrifices in this regard: in France, 27% of the population eligible for Structural Funds will no longer be eligible at the end of the transitional period, and this percentage is even higher in some regions such as Pays de la Loire, Alsace and Basse-Normandie, right-wing electoral strongholds disadvantaged by the left-wing government's partisan philanthropy. On this basis, it is extremely doubtful whether regional policy can contribute to a balanced development of the territories of the Member States of the European Union. Von Wogau report (A5-0069/1999) Given the employment situation in the Community and the European Union's stated ambition to combat unemployment decisively, the Commission's analysis of industrial concentrations should take account of factors other than competition alone. As an example, I would like to cite the restructuring of ABB-Alsthom Power, from which a large delegation of workers from all over Europe is here in Strasbourg today. The management of ABB-Alsthom Power, which was formed from a merger in June 1999, has announced a restructuring that will lead to job losses in some countries. This disastrous employment situation raises numerous questions, particularly regarding the information provided to the European Works Council, which has existed since 1996. This means that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened. This also includes monitoring mergers, taking into account employment, the environment, and consumer concerns. The report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was inadequate in this regard, which is why I abstained. (PT) The Commission wishes to apply the principle of subsidiarity in the area of Community competition policy, and for this reason it is decentralising decision-making powers regarding abuses of dominant positions through agreements between undertakings that distort the market, transferring them to national authorities and courts, while still leaving matters relating to mergers and State aid subject to the notification system. The current position is aimed at creating faster and cheaper forms of competition policy, with Community law now being applied at the level of national courts rather than the European Court of Justice, and even referring the matter to specialised courts. This partial renationalisation of competition policy may entail higher costs for the Member States. On the other hand, and the rapporteur points out that, in the name of competition policy, state monopolies have often been replaced by private monopolies, through the privatisation of important public sectors and undertakings, as has happened in Portugal, with negative consequences for the country and for workers.	de
In response, the Commission has made several commitments and has undoubtedly adopted numerous reform measures. It must be acknowledged that the new President, Mr. Prodi, and his team are genuinely committed to implementing the financial control requirements established by Parliament. Nevertheless, the reform of the European Commission must now be placed within the framework of the debate that will take place in the run-up to the upcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives. The current Treaties of the European Union will be amended to ensure, for example, that enlargement is a success. I am sure that the forthcoming reforms of the Community institutions will be analyzed during this debate. But for the small Member States, it is important that the reforms of the European Commission that are about to take place do not jeopardize the representation of small Member States within the Commission. Mr. President, the Commission is asking for discharge for 1997, but, in reality, it does not deserve it. The 1997 financial year was the responsibility of the old Commission; therefore, the new Commission feels that it has no responsibility to assume. It is true that the implementation of the 1997 budget was the responsibility of the old Commission, but the new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to clean up the past scandals, and I must confess that I am not at all impressed by what it has done so far. The old mentality of covering things up and supporting one's friends is unfortunately still present. Some people say that we would be better off putting the old culprits into oblivion and starting afresh, but I do not think we can start afresh unless we have first sorted things out. I am thinking particularly of the recent scandals affecting the ECHO programme. I am absolutely shocked at the difficulty in obtaining documents relating to this affair. I am the rapporteur for the ECHO programme in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I find it extremely difficult to carry out my work when the Commission refuses to give me the information I need. From the outside, one gets the impression that the Commission has things to hide. My investigations unfortunately also tend to show that this may be the case. The Commission is not putting everything on the table and is repeating its age-old practices. These are the practices that were fatal to the former Commission. I therefore fully support the request to give the Assembly unconditional access to administrative documents, otherwise we cannot carry out our work. Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer! The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. Follow-up to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the follow-up to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission.	fr
In some passages of the Commission's proposals, perhaps excessive caution has been exercised, for example, with the demand that the imprisoned defendant be allowed to decide whether or not to consent to temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of an investigation. Personally, I consider it unacceptable that Mr. Pinochet, for example, should be allowed to decide whether or not to be transferred to Spain for a face-to-face interview. Or with the demand that the witness or expert—and not just the accused—be provided with legal counsel during remote questioning. But these are minor deficiencies, unintentional on the part of the rapporteur, which will hopefully be remedied by the vote of this House. The rapporteur has demonstrated commendable commitment, which must be acknowledged, and for which I thank him. The overall result is remarkable and will hopefully be fully taken into account by the Council. As already mentioned, one issue, the most sensitive, remains unresolved: it concerns Article 18 of the Convention, which concerns the direct interception of telecommunications by another Member State, without the latter requesting assistance from the Member State in which the interception is carried out, which is now possible thanks to modern technology. This issue is highly controversial, as it represents a potential source of abuse. While it could be argued that the proposed arrangements are, on the whole, better than nothing, the Committee nevertheless found them inadequate and insufficiently secure. It therefore merits further consideration. At a time when the conflicting reports on ECHELON raise the specter of Big Brother, it is likely that more detailed research will be needed into the instruments and methods that can, on the one hand, protect individuals' rights and, on the other, facilitate the effective, yet lawful and legal, fight against crime. The aim is therefore to achieve, wherever possible, a delicate balance between the effectiveness of the fight against crime and the respect for human freedom and dignity: an objective pursued not only by individual Member States but now also by the policy of the Union, which aspires to become an area of freedom, security, and justice. This objective may still be a long way off, but it can be achieved step by step. The most important step will be the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States, but for today we will content ourselves with this small step because it goes in the right direction. Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanations. They highlight some serious flaws in this proposal. The lack of linguistic clarity will inevitably lead to legal uncertainty. But legal certainty is something that is absolutely essential on such crucial issues. Because of its sloppy drafting, the Convention can be interpreted very broadly, and it ignores the strict conditions that must apply to surveillance under the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 18 permits surveillance in another Member State without its involvement. Not only should this be deleted, but the entire surveillance title should be scrapped altogether. An FBI initiative compiled the user requirements that form the basis of current legislation. The Council proposal containing these requirements, ENFOPOL 98, was adopted by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report.	de
"The fundamental question, in my opinion, that this Parliament, the Commission, and the Council must ask themselves is this: What is Europe? What does Europe mean and give us beyond and beyond the parameters of our national borders? Europe is its people, its history, and now its community; but the reason Culture 2000 is so important to us is this: I bet that when we ask the question ""what is Europe?"" we answer by saying ""it is our art, it is our literature, and it is our heritage."" That is what Culture 2000 represents. It represents the possibility of maintaining a European identity in the 21st century, an identity that silences the echoes of division, war, poverty, opportunity, and poverty in reality. And beyond that—and this is more prosaic, Madam President—it means that we have the capacity to learn from previous policy initiatives and implement them in new programs that are broad, cross-cutting, and that benefit our creative industries to the extent necessary. The program promotes mobility and opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded. I only regret that we do not have sufficient funds to promote this program in line with our aspirations and to make it available to everyone. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached the end of a long journey. After the conciliation stage, our institutions can now officially approve the new ""Culture 2000"" framework program. We will thus have a fully suitable instrument to carry out, over the next five years, clear, well-structured, and—I am sure—fruitful action in favor of the cultural sector. I welcome this happy ending here today and express my gratitude to you. I thank all those in this Parliament who worked to make a successful conciliation conclusion possible. I wish to express my particular thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and in particular to its rapporteur, Mr. Graça Moura, its chairman, Mr. Gargani, the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups, the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr. Imbeni. All of them have made a constructive, balanced, and decisive contribution. Throughout these negotiations, they have been of great help, and it must be said that the difficult, sometimes painful, negotiation was nevertheless completed in a minimum amount of time. We now have a framework programme, the first of its kind for the cultural sector, which allows us to consider our action from a new angle and to work for culture in a more comprehensive, but also more complete and in-depth way. I would like to welcome, along with the Honourable Members, these satisfactory results, which, despite a budgetary situation that falls short of our ambitions, should allow us to consider the future in a completely positive light. I would like to underline what President Gargani just said: the Commission has issued a statement on the mid-term review."	es
This is, in reality, an international agreement and a trade agreement. In conclusion, let me express the great hopes I have for the peace process in that region, a part of the world that desperately needs it to regroup and reform and help its millions of disadvantaged and poverty-stricken citizens. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it is obvious that the rules must be respected. It is also obvious that our partners must enforce them. Everyone understands that we are concerned about this today, but I would not want our demand to be seen as selective. Nor would I want our oral question to be received as an accusation. Because our demand is not selective, the Commission must also feel invited to study the use of Community funds in the regions neighboring Israel. And because the Commission's question is not, and should not be, seen as an accusation, I wish to recall two essential points for the balance of our action. First, everyone familiar with the region knows that the development of the Palestinian economy is closely linked to the economic cooperation agreement with Israel. The Oslo Protocol provides for customs integration encompassing Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Anything that would separate the two economies would seriously affect Israeli-Palestinian cooperation, including joint ventures, Palestinian subcontractors, and Palestinian exporters. Second, nowhere in the agreements between Israel and the European Union are the borders of the State of Israel defined. The definition of these borders is precisely what is at stake in the ongoing negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Any attempt by the European Union to impose its own conception of Israel's territoriality would be, at the very least, a blunder that would be detrimental to these negotiations and to our understanding of the role Europe should play in the region. I support the cautious approach the Commissioner has taken and continues to take on this issue, firstly because it is not a simple matter. It is complex; it is always difficult to determine the origin and provenance of goods. This is even more so in the Middle East, because there is a situation there in which there are numerous joint ventures between Israel and the Palestinians, in which in some cases the products are manufactured partly in the Palestinian area and partly in the State of Israel. But these developments are good; they bode well for the future, because if trade is conducted this way in the Middle East, it will form the foundation of the peace agreement. Therefore, since it is not an easy or simple matter, we must be prudent and proceed with caution. The second reason why the Commission should proceed in this way is that if the European Union wishes to play a role in the area ensuring peace, it must be considered fair and impartial, and it would be neither fair nor impartial to rush into a decision without letting the talks and the groups that are meeting determine the situation both regarding the conditions relating to the trade agreement for the area with the State of Israel and, as I say, regarding the goods and their provenance at the same time.	es
It is no longer sustainable that the community should have to pay for the damage caused by individuals, often through criminal activities. We must introduce liability for those who cause all sorts of damage to our environment, because then they will think twice before transporting crude oil in a tanker that is about to break up. More than five years ago, in 1994, when I became a member of the Legal Affairs Committee of this Parliament, I was assigned to draft the report on environmental liability. Since then I have been waiting for an initiative from the Commission that will give me material to work on. This scandal must be put to an end as soon as possible, and I hope that the debate on this dossier will not be adjourned for the umpteenth time in February! - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the storm that marked the turn of the century should ultimately make us reflect on certain issues. It has become clear that man, today as always, is incapable of escaping natural disasters. Natural disasters have always existed and will continue to exist in the future. It is natural that solidarity must be shown in this regard. There is no doubt that we need a pan-European civil protection service, and a budget line for natural disasters must be included in the European Union budget. But the most important thing is to recognise the principle that in the relationship between nature and man, it is always man who makes mistakes, perpetuating his mistakes sometimes for centuries. Nature never makes mistakes, because it cannot make mistakes. The damage, in the case in question, depends on population density, the shape of the infrastructure and obviously on the many monocultures, if we are talking about forests. It is clear that we must provide all the help possible, but in doing so we must bear in mind that electricity and telephone cables may be buried more often in the future. We must shorten the cycles and ensure reforestation with mixed forests, which are more stable than monocultures. The most important debate in this context is the one on climate. In Europe we are privileged because we have the Gulf Stream and because it still works. America and Southeast Asia are much worse off than us when it comes to storms. Fortunately, we have the Gulf Stream, but we too, like everyone else, are subject to the greenhouse effect, and this is partly caused by man, although it is difficult to prove climate change mathematically. We must pay more attention to the recommendations of the Kyoto Conference on the environment. We must reduce CO2 emissions, use renewable energy sources and, in this context, ask ourselves what the state of health of Europe's forests is. Mr President, I believe that what we must deplore first and foremost is the loss of human life. An irreparable loss. Secondly, we welcome the solidarity that has emerged between the French departments and citizens, as well as that shown by other countries towards France, the country most affected. Given the very limited time available to me, Mr President, I will simply highlight two aspects of our resolution. The first aspect seems to me to be implicitly acknowledged by the Commissioner, when he asks whether these are natural disasters or not.	it
Furthermore, in this regard, we should also consider whether it would not be better to use an early warning system, a sort of yellow card instead of immediately resorting to the red card, which will act as a fine and threaten the survival of the company. Mr President, speaking last gives me the privilege of being able to tell the Commissioner that the majority of this House supports your initiative and that you have shown total confidence, in my view fully justified, in the way in which you are steering the ship into port. On this boat, however, we also want to do our part as rowers: and if we also want to row, it is precisely because we are all in the same boat. I therefore believe it is absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue that will enable us to steer, refine and specify this very important reform. The various ideas heard here could be grouped into three broad categories. Firstly, the concern expressed by many, and in particular by the Chair of the Economic and Financial Committee, Mrs Randzio-Plath, to ensure that this new system of legal exception is fully compatible with the Treaty. I share this concern and believe that the issue should be addressed. Secondly, the issue of legal certainty for businesses. It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for producing legal certainty. We agree on that. But it is no less true - as reiterated by all the members of this House - that the European industrial fabric is a fabric of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimation, of guarantor of the legitimacy of the internal market. And it is in this respect that I would like to express my opinion on a remark made by Mr Karas. There have only been nine decisions of denial. But here I have to draw on my experience as a lawyer: who knows how many times a lawyer, with two companies and a project, in the light of a preventive orientation expressed by the Commission, has ended up changing that project, so as to make it compatible with the competition rules! This aspect cannot be ignored. Thirdly, the problem of the uniform application of Community law. In this regard, there is nothing to add to the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen. I consider biodiversity to be a positive fact, I also consider cultural diversity to be positive, but not diversity in the application of the law, and in particular of competition law, which is the hard core of the internal market. And here we need to refine things. Only in some countries, in Germany for example, is there a specific jurisdiction. Perhaps this is a path to explore, but certainly not the only one. What we certainly cannot afford, Commissioner - and I would like to conclude on this very point - is to leave room and provide arguments to those who are trying to present the European institutions as something intended for large bodies, for those who matter, for the rich and not for the citizen, not for small and medium-sized enterprises, which in the worst case scenario - but this will not happen, because measures will be taken to avoid it - would find themselves relegated to a justice system that issues conflicting judgments, with very long delays, without any possibility of control except what the French call the parcours du combatant, that is, taking on a procedure that lasts years until the judgment of the Court of Justice, which as we well know is currently overloaded with work.	it
In this context, the various references to regional cooperation with neighbouring countries take on significant political significance. The agreement is also particularly important because it can and must also serve as an example for the other countries in the Balkan area. However, this process must be supported by a real political will on the part of the European Union to move closer to these countries. We know that some of them are undergoing democratisation processes, others have yet to assert the democratic authority of the State, while others owe their balance to a military presence in the area. In any case, these countries are now aware that, once the difficulties have been overcome, they will be able to establish a concrete link with the European Union. Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I do not intend to join the unanimous chorus of colleagues. I think the report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy. In paragraph 4, mention is made of the exemplary nature of the agreement. We know that, from Lithuania to Turkey, there are thirteen candidate countries and that there is only one black hole in Europe, the Balkans, and while these countries are denied the possibility of applying, we would like to make them believe that the agreement is miraculous. Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the political agreement, the political prospect that being a candidate represents. The report is not only a masterpiece of hypocrisy, but also an aberration, because, ladies and gentlemen, even if negotiations start tomorrow, the agreement will be concluded in a year and will enter into force in three years. I defy you to doubt that, among the Balkan countries, applications for membership will not be submitted in due form within these three years by Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia. A few days ago Racan announced Croatia's formal application for membership by the end of 2000. I am sure that we will have other applications for membership and that this beautiful work, this beautiful intellectual architecture will crumble, because it will be overtaken by events, as we have been overtaken in the last twenty years by everything that has happened in the former Yugoslavia. All this would not be serious if there were no problems that we know about in this region of Europe, if there were no problems that are being faced, but have not yet been solved by the new government of Macedonia, the problems of cohabitation between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, with the issues connected to Kosovo, if there were no known economic problems, the problems of neighborhood with a particularly powerful mafia in Serbia, if there were no problem constituted by a veto that should be denounced for what it is, the veto of Greece that, after almost ten years, continues to prevent this country from calling itself by its name, and I hope that the interpreters did not use the term FYROM when I spoke of Macedonia. This is absolutely absurd. I think it is an insult, first and foremost, to our Greek colleagues, to the citizens of Greece. We urgently need to find a solution to this issue. Finally, by a very happy chance, I learned of a letter sent by Georgievski, President of Macedonia, to Commissioner Fischler, dated 8 March, in which, referring to Article O, which has become Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks that Macedonia be allowed to join the European Union.	it
"Mrs. Aung San Sui Kyi cannot feel totally abandoned, including by Europe. My request is that this country once again have a privileged position on the agenda. Mr. President, Mr. President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the European Union's affirmation in the world cannot be determined solely by economic power. An essential feature of what distinguishes us is the systematic reference to human rights, both on our part and on the part of those with whom we interact. The European Parliament, which has managed to overcome the limitations resulting from selfishness and ""national interests"" sometimes expressed in the positions of Member States and even other European Union institutions, has played a fundamental role in promoting and defending human rights. Therefore, it can be said, for example, that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten, which could have been the worst enemy of a just solution for its people, who always opposed the Indonesian occupation. That is why, even recently, we opposed arms sales to Indonesia, a position that, unfortunately, the Council ignored. But it is not enough to prevent or put an end to situations of outrageous aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against the weakest. It is essential that, once violations are committed, the perpetrators do not go unpunished, whoever they may be, wherever they may be, in Indonesia or Angola, Cuba, China or Burma, whether the perpetrator is a civilian or a military officer, a soldier, a general or a minister. Let justice be done in Indonesia. Let justice be done in East Timor. President Wahid needs our support to address the difficult situation at hand. This resolution, at the initiative of the EPP, rightly includes an express reference to East Timor. What happened there in that country, and which I witnessed in part, representing this Parliament, cannot go unpunished. Speaking about East Timor must also mean remembering the situation of tens of thousands of East Timorese refugees on Indonesian territory, in inhumane conditions, controlled by Indonesian soldiers and militias, used as bargaining chips. This is an intolerable situation that urgently needs to end. Mr. President, a few very brief comments on behalf of the Presidency of the Council. First, to recall that the Presidency's role is above all a task of coordination, of seeking common positions on the initiatives that the Fifteen must adopt in the Council, recalling that the experiences of previous sessions of the Commission on Human Rights have revealed—precisely thanks to this coordination work by the Presidencies—a great capacity for the European Union to assert itself as an entity with its own policy within the Commission, something that should be maintained. I would also like to say that the European Parliament's participation in the preparatory work is important for the coherent affirmation of the European Union's positions on the various situations, which is why the Presidency naturally welcomes all proposals, particularly all contributions arising from the texts of the resolutions submitted."	es
"We therefore call on the Commission to take specific measures and to introduce the principle of equal opportunities in all programmes for tourism and business development. Mr President, Members of the Commission, I would like to begin with a few words of optimism, which were offered to us in the communication of the High Level Group in October 1998, when on the first page it was written: ""By the end of the next decade in the Union there will be the possibility of creating between 2,200,000 and 3,300,000 new jobs in tourism activities"", and it was added: ""only by creating the right conditions"". I believe that the Commission and this Parliament are called upon to answer two questions: what are the right conditions and what can be the role of the European Union in this regard? The Commission and Parliament can help us understand first of all what exactly we are talking about, because even the term ""tourism"", as was also pointed out in the Viceconte report, is still an ambiguous term, a sort of variable dependent on latitudes, climates, many occasions, many elements of interpretation; it can be synonymous with vacation or it can actually be a place of production, income, wealth and employment. The data is missing: we have no data on the economic impact, which still remains absolutely mysterious. We have criteria for collecting and interpreting statistics that are completely at odds with each other, despite what a directive from the Commission and Parliament in 1995 said. I believe that it is essential, in order to develop a strategy, to have a homogeneous and as rigorous as possible reading of these data, also to ensure that tourism is truly capable of producing employment. There is no automatic mechanism in this sense: often in the past there have been large accumulations of wealth thanks to the growth of the tourism industry, without this being matched by an increase in employment. There is no legal basis and we believe that this is the great limitation, today, of any intervention in the tourism sector. A legal basis translates into a capacity for coordination, planning and strategy, which are essential for tourism in the European Union to be competitive with other markets. A legal basis would avoid having to draw, as has happened in the past, on structural funds, a sort of pocket money, moreover made available in minimal amounts: let us remember that the Commission communication indicated a sum equal to 4,700,000,000 euros in the last five years, which corresponds to the cost of 400 kilometres of motorway. There is no possibility of giving the States a strong signal: recognition of the legal basis of tourism would allow the States to recognise the European Union's competence which at the moment is absolutely sporadic. We are in complete agreement with the Community measures indicated in the Commission communication: advantageous taxation, that is, tax measures capable of offering that productive fabric - which, let us remember, is made up of 95 per cent small and medium-sized enterprises, equivalent to 2 million small and medium-sized enterprises involved in the tourism sector in Europe - truly competitive conditions on this market; paying particular attention to professional qualifications in the European Union, and therefore investing in training; and finally, committing to transparency in the labour market."	it
In my view, such parameters—particularly those related to quality, resulting from investments in continuing training, vocational training, adaptation measures, and the retraining of older workers—are, given their sustained medium-term impact, much more important and binding than the mere formulation of always controversial annual quantitative targets for job creation or reduction. If, among other things, as the Portuguese Presidency's programme also emphasizes, the Commission could launch a new phase of social dialogue, focused on a coordinated strategy of socialization and knowledge dissemination—in short, on an employability strategy and the definition of its rules—this could constitute progress towards worker participation in the sound and consensual management of restructuring and reemployment processes. Thirdly, I do not consider the decline in the workforce due to an ageing population to be an inevitable fate for the European Union, not only because of the scope offered by increasing female employment and immigration, but because the widespread trend towards early retirement and premature withdrawal from the labor market must be decisively curbed by gearing the coordinated reform of social protection systems not toward significant cuts in future pensions, but toward actively exploiting longer life expectancy and extending working life. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you, Mr Prodi, come across as very reform-minded and very ambitious. You and your ambition are most welcome. It will be necessary, given the enormous task that awaits you. But in order to implement all these reforms and also to advance the 2001 legislative program, one must be completely confident not only in one's own strengths as reformers, but also in the opinions of others. You say you will undoubtedly come to this House and ask for more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be fully aware of how thin the financial cushion is on which we stand. We have 1.27% of the Community's GDP. Not a euro more, not a euro less. It will not be us who refuse these new resources; you will have to ask the Council. This financial perspective is finely tuned. In order to finance your stability plan in the Balkans, a substantial revision of Category 4 will have to be negotiated, and you will remember the enormous difficulties we encountered in adopting the 2000 budget. I would remind you that this group, the PPE-DE, does not like to finance new political initiatives by sacrificing existing ones. Political priorities must be defined by this Parliament and the Members of the European Parliament. Never think that the budgetary reform you are proposing will conceal the limitations of the Community's financial system. We would do well to make every effort, by mutual consent, to achieve budgetary austerity, but be fully aware that the inadequacy of resources, the lack of financial autonomy, and poor budgetary implementation remain urgent issues that need to be addressed. So we ask ourselves: Does the Commission have the political will to resolve them? Madam President, the Commission's communication is well-worded, but so vague that all sorts of interpretations are possible.	de
This is not the point, obviously, because such a quota would be unrealistic. The report does not mention the timeframe within which this quota would have to be achieved. To calm matters and reassure Members, I have tabled an amendment to the resolution by which we simply note that the Commission is committed to making significant efforts to increase women's participation in Community research programs, which is even commendable. Furthermore, it must be noted that the Commission has written to us verbatim that it considers it essential to achieve a minimum of 40% women's participation at all levels of the implementation and management of research programs. This is not a quota. It is a very legitimate declaration of intent on the part of the Commission, insofar as it concerns its own programs and not those of the Member States, which would do well to be inspired by this good example of the Commission and to continue to deploy the same efforts within the framework of their research programs. May this be conveyed to them! (FR) It is gratifying that the debate on Mrs. McNally's report, on the subject of increasing and facilitating women's participation in research and science, is the subject of a fairly broad consensus. In this matter, a better translation of the notion of equal opportunities into everyday reality is both highly desirable, and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy that will result in the satisfaction of women's legitimate aspirations: to benefit from equal access to scientific studies, to obtain positions of responsibility truly commensurate with their achievements and capabilities, as well as the rapid implementation of accompanying measures that will allow them to reconcile family and professional life. But this necessary realistic and pragmatic policy, which should focus on eliminating the specific obstacles identified as indisputable factors in this inequality, must, in our view, be based on the concept of complementarity, the only one that can justify a proactive policy in this area. Our reflection and future actions must focus on respect for these values, which are truly respectful of differences, and not on the postulate of gender equality, which is fraught with contradictions. Nothing justifies abandoning ourselves to the facile practice of quantitative policies based on quotas, contrary to the notion of citizenship with which the members of the UEN Group identify, and whose likely consequences would be the opposite of what Ms. McNally's report seems to seek: the participation of women in scientific and research work in proportion to their worth. If they have the opportunity to demonstrate their true merits, if they eliminate as much as possible the barriers related to the specific nature of their status, and not within the framework of a conflict in which they would give the impression of fighting against the privileges of men, women will demonstrate their interest in achieving the fulfillment of their professional careers and will succeed in modifying the imbalances that still disadvantage them.	es
My second question will be of a more technical nature, but it is important with a view to the most harmonious possible transfer to the European Union of the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union. In this area, you mentioned the creation of three committees: a political and security committee launched today, and the Military Committee. You then mentioned your relations with third countries that are members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the WEU, but are not members of the European Union. Within the framework of the functioning of the provisional institutions, whose creation has just been decided, could you tell us, Mr. High Representative, what status you intend to confer on the members of the Alliance and the states associated with the WEU—I repeat—that are not yet members of the European Union? Could they, for example, occupy observer positions within the various political and security committees or the Military Committee? These countries are concerned about the danger of being isolated, and I wish to express my understanding of their desire to participate with you in this endeavor. Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General of the Council, as you will understand, we in this House have followed with great interest the information you have provided us with regarding the outcome of the informal meeting of Defense Ministers held in Sintra and its significance for the process of European integration in matters of security and defense. I am also grateful that you have shared with this Parliament the telephone conversation you had with Mr. Álvaro Gil-Robles. However, in the area of foreign policy, I have doubts about whether we are moving at the pace required by needs—as some of my colleagues have already said this afternoon—without, of course, ignoring the difficulties you are encountering. I will give you an example: During the recent tour of the President of the European Parliament to the Middle East, which you mentioned, the various parties to the conflict agreed on a demand for a more active European Union presence in the peace process underway in the region. Do you believe, Mr. Secretary General, that the representatives of the Community institutions and the governments of the Member States are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, aspire to mediate between two opposing parties? I believe this Parliament has some doubts about this; I don't know if you share them. In that regard, as you know, the European Parliament has been working on the initiative to form a common diplomatic corps for the Community, obviously without the aim of replacing the diplomatic services of the Member States, but rather to complement them and eventually contribute to their better coordination. I could ask you, Mr. High Representative, for an initial reaction to this initiative, without prejudice to what you can give us in greater detail in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. Solana, it has been repeatedly said in this House that prevention is better than intervention. Certainly, it is better, but I don't see why Europe should not equip itself with the tools that allow it to intervene when prevention fails.	es
Furthermore, a huge warehouse has been built, the planning permission for which appears difficult to obtain, and the Drogheda Corporation is also planning other infrastructure. How can the Commission guarantee that this type of development, financed through structural funds, does not jeopardise the necessary nature conservation efforts in the area? Is the Commission prepared to suspend all funding pending a review of the regional development plans? (SV) The Commission is aware of the construction of this port, but it has had no knowledge of the construction of this warehouse, or of the other infrastructure mentioned by the Member. The construction of the port is being financed through structural funds, and its main consequence is the dredging of the mouth of the River Boyne and the temporary storage of masses of sediment collected on the Stegrennan mudflat. The area around the Boyne Estuary has been designated a Special Protection Area under the Wild Birds Directive. This means that any exploitation in or near the river estuary must comply with the protection rules laid down for this area by the EU Habitats Directive. Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the construction of the port would damage the Stegrennan mudflat, which is now part of the protected area, and that the applicable protection rules had not been complied with. After examining these complaints during 1998 and early 1999—a period during which the project received no Structural Fund support—the Commission was satisfied by the summer of 1999 that the protection rules had been taken into account in the construction of the port. A detailed study of the environmental consequences had been carried out. The most negative consequence of the project, namely the loss of the Stegrennan mudflat, is only temporary, as the contractor in charge of the work is required to rehabilitate the site. At the Commission's request, the Stegrennan mudflat was formally included in the Boyne Estuary Special Protection Area, of which it was not previously part. To compensate for the negative effects of this temporary disappearance of the mudflat on the bird populations concerned, it was also planned to improve other breeding sites for these species in the estuary area. However, since the summer of 1999, this latter measure has been the subject of litigation. The Irish authorities first reversed the originally planned improvement measure. Then, following a complaint filed by an environmental non-governmental organization in an Irish court, they reinstated it. However, the new provision contained minor amendments that led to a new complaint. Given that Ireland has committed to compensatory measures, and that a number of other problems have now been resolved, the Commission cannot propose today to freeze financial assistance from the Structural Funds. However, it is prepared to discuss with the Irish authorities the issue of compensatory measures for the improvement of certain natural habitats, particularly in light of the legal action still pending before an Irish court.	fr
Since both legal aspects often overlap and violations of the Union budget are increasingly cross-border, including those committed by organized crime, jurisdiction among the Member States is unclear. Added to this are differences in individual national legal provisions and lengthy or even unfulfilled requests for mutual legal assistance. The Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, signed by the European Council in 1995, and the two subsequent protocols have not changed this. To enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States. So far, after five years, only four have done so. This deadlock, which threatens to undermine the Union's credibility, has led Parliament to propose a European law enforcement agency. This is by no means intended to create a transnational criminal and judicial system. Rather, the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments to protect its financial interests, while respecting subsidiarity. With today's report, we revive this idea and call on the Commission to submit legislative proposals to achieve this goal. The concerns expressed by the Committee on Legal Affairs, as well as those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will be fully taken into account. We make two recommendations arising from the creation of OLAF and intended to ensure its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of individual rights. To this end, we need – the first recommendation – a legal act that defines criminal offenses detrimental to the Union's financial interests and establishes guiding principles. In one amendment, I support the deadline for the Commission to submit its proposal by 30 September. The second recommendation concerns criminal proceedings. The Commission should propose – and here, again, I have amended this by 31 May 2000 – a legal act establishing an independent body, institutionally linked to the Commission, to coordinate and monitor the proper conduct of OLAF's investigative work. The existing Supervisory Committee can only monitor the independence of the Office's Director. The proposal for such a legal act should include an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which should be limited to investigations and internal prosecutions by OLAF that harm the Union's financial interests, as well as its relations with national authorities. Any influence on the administration of justice in the Member States is excluded. The Court of Justice should be responsible for monitoring the legality of legal acts. We also call on the upcoming Intergovernmental Conference to open the debate on the creation of a European law enforcement agency to protect the Union's financial interests, if possible on the basis of the now widely recognized study, the so-called corpus juris, prepared by renowned academics, as well as the feasibility studies published subsequently. Further support for this project can be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men. The Commission, Mr. Barnier and Mr. Vitorino, as well as some Member States are also open to the idea. I ask you, dear colleagues, for your positive vote on this report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted by a large majority. We can once again send a signal that Parliament is actively preventing mismanagement, and especially fraud, and, where necessary, imposing penalties. Mr President, I am pleased to be able to speak in the debate on this report and to congratulate Mrs Theato.	de
Who would want such a thing? Is it not our responsibility to evaluate and choose ways to counteract this policy? Europe is a community of law. Among the principles we are called upon to defend are democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law. It is imperative in a democracy not to judge election results, but to respect them. We must therefore respect the decisions that the Austrians, for reasons inherent to their policy, have deemed it appropriate to take. It is a question of respect for the principles of the rule of law that the Presidency of the Council does not express itself in the way it has done, i.e. in a way that is contrary to the Treaties. It is a question of political intelligence not to isolate the ÖVP, but to help it - as an undoubtedly democratic, rule-of-law and European-oriented party - to ensure that Austria, equally undoubtedly, remains a member of this European Community. For this reason, the ÖVP Members must have our support in this difficult situation, because isolation is definitely the wrong path! (Applause) Madam President, as we say in my part of the world, 'the Welsh always try three times'; as you will have realised in the course of this debate, I have three times expressed the desire to comment briefly on a debate that has undoubtedly proved to be of a very high standard and, at times, even moving. Firstly, on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission, I would like to thank you for the support and understanding that many Members have given to the position taken by the Commission in its statement yesterday. I obviously owe a response to those who have denounced - and I repeat the exact words used - the ambiguity, acquiescence and fragility of the Commission's opinion. I feel obliged to state before this Parliament that there is no ambiguity, no fragility or acquiescence in the opinion expressed by the Commission, nor in the action which the Commission itself has taken on this matter. In our statement yesterday morning we explicitly stated (as did the President this afternoon) that we share the concerns expressed by the fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday. Secondly, we specifically stated that we will work closely with all Member States to examine developments in Austria. Thirdly, we have made it very clear that we will defend, with courageous impartiality, the wording of Article 6 of the Treaty and the values which are expressed therein, as well as our firm intention - in the spirit of Article 7 of the Treaty - to ensure that these values, freedom, democracy and fundamental rights, are not undermined. There is no ambiguity, no fragility or acquiescence in all this. And when I say that the Commission has expressed this opinion, I am also referring to my dear colleague Franz Fischler, who is Austrian and who, in endorsing the statement made yesterday morning, has once again demonstrated his integrity, his independence and his loyalty to the oath he took as a member of the European Commission.	it
"Shifting the tax burden from labor to the consumption of raw materials and natural resources, on the other hand, makes a lasting contribution. Mr. President, I would first like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he has presented to us—not here today, but in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Politically speaking, these are two completely different reports. In general terms, we could say that the first report is a left-wing report, addressing social aspects alongside economic problems. The report we now have before us, for which I believe my colleague has championed very well, is ""hybrid."" Starting from a structure with social aspects, the main conclusions are withdrawn. So what does Mr. Katiforis propose, and what can we conclude from the report? He has offered us an ambitious report in a hopeful Europe, in which quantified targets for the desired results should be set. And Europe has made progress with procedures based on quantified targets. Why, for example, was the proposal to increase the working population in Europe to 75% of the population withdrawn? A working population of 60% is very low compared to Japan or the United States, and with such a low employment rate, we cannot produce the same as those countries. We must therefore increase the employment rate through competitive jobs. Just as was the case at the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare the workforce here for new technologies through scientific training. Investment must also grow at a faster pace. Mr. von Wogau's idea that the workforce must be flexible is an argument all too familiar to us. I would counter him with the example of Portugal, where labor laws are inflexible and the unemployment rate is below 5%—and has been falling steadily in recent years—because investment is growing much faster than the Community average (no doubt with Community support). We therefore strive for a Europe with economic growth, but also with social considerations. Mr. President, Like many of my colleagues, I would like to thank Mr. Katiforis for an interesting report. Reading it and considering the picture of the EU economy it paints, I find it to be a rather worrying one. Investment is too low, unemployment is still far too high, and growth is insufficient. Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that the euro is losing ground against other currencies, despite rumors of secret purchases by the European Central Bank. The rapporteur states that stability is not an end in itself. I can only agree. There is far too much talk about stability, convergence, and coordination, but far too little about the factors necessary for innovation and development. In my view, cooperation within the EMU is a heavy colossus that cannot really keep pace with the enormous flexibility of the economy. My conclusions, however, differ from those of the previous speaker. I believe that we must focus on the human factor, firstly through macroeconomic policies that create increased demand and new jobs and secondly - and perhaps first and foremost - through measures in working life such as training, the democratisation of companies and good social conditions."	de
I understand that it is not a contentious issue that the Council's statement on the upcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights will not include the declaration on the 50th Anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, and that this statement, to make it in a noble and solemn manner, has been postponed to the March plenary session. I understand that there is agreement on this point. Madam President, this afternoon in this House, reference was made to a number of reports from this morning's BBC Today programme, which alleged that some of my colleagues are running companies they own that act as lobbyists or are in some way abusing their position as Members of this House. These allegations are very serious and are completely false, malicious, and politically biased. They were disseminated with full knowledge of their falsity. We are currently receiving legal advice. The Register of Interests of my colleagues is complete. If we discover that any Member of this Parliament or any of its employees has collaborated with the BBC in this farrago, we will expose them to the opprobrium of this House. That's exactly it. We fully agree. b) Sessions of 1 and 2 March 2000 in Brussels Sustainable urban development - Rural development - EQUAL Initiative. (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners and members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I have been tasked with preparing the European Parliament's report on the Interreg III Community initiative programme. When the matter came before committee, we studied more than 100 amendments, and as of today, 17 more amendments have been tabled, some of them previously tabled in committee. Before entering into the debate on the content of the resolution I am proposing, I would like to inform you about the elements I have taken into account in guiding my work as rapporteur. First of all, I would like to remind you of the role of the Interreg III Community initiative, based on the principles of transnationality and innovation. This program represents a European-wide development engine. Interreg is one of the four Community initiatives planned for the period 2000-2006 and will have the largest financial allocation, €4.872 billion compared to the current €3.604 billion. The Interreg initiative, created in 1990, is based on the desire to prepare European regions for the creation of a borderless Europe, within the framework of the achievement of the large single market. When the Structural Funds were reformed in 1994 and 1996, the Interreg CIP integrated new aspects that contributed to the development of trans-European energy transmission and distribution networks. These programs have fostered cross-border, transnational, and interregional cooperation within the European Union, favoring the balanced development of the Community area. This is the objective of the Interreg III programme, whose guidelines are being submitted to us today by the European Commission, in accordance with the provisions of European Community Regulation No. 1260 of 1999 concerning general provisions for the Structural Funds. It is based on three aspects: Chapter A, which organizes cross-border cooperation between territorial authorities in border regions, both within and outside the European Union, based on common development strategies whose implementation is the responsibility of the Member States and local and regional authorities; Chapter B provides for transnational cooperation between national, regional, and local authorities in several Member States or candidate countries seeking accession to the European Union, within the areas of spatial planning, transport networks, and the environment.	es
Thirdly, the EU and the ACP countries have agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious corruption cases. This is a real innovation, both in the EU/ACP context and in international relations in general. This procedure will be applied not only in corruption cases involving EDF resources, but also more broadly, in any country where the Community is financially involved and where corruption is an obstacle to development. It is therefore not limited to EC activities. This is a very important aspect, given the eligibility of public finances to benefit from the funds. By including this provision in the Partnership Agreement, the European Union and the ACP States are jointly sending a clear and concrete signal, which will undoubtedly be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors. Another new element in the EU-ACP agreement is migration. We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area. The new dimension of the Partnership Agreement reflects the orientations adopted by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere, Finland, in October 1999. The European Union is committed to defining and implementing an immigration and asylum policy based on the principle of cooperation with the countries and regions of origin. The Agreement concluded with the ACP countries opens the way to new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third-country nationals within the Union, and to new measures to facilitate their integration. We have also decided to take measures on illegal immigration. The EU and the ACP States will launch a process to define, in a framework to be negotiated with each ACP country, the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present in the territories of each party. The provisions also cover persons from third countries and stateless persons. These innovative orientations offer valuable opportunities for improving the governance of public affairs. The Agreement also provides a good regulatory framework to support the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid. We have decided to launch a process to define new trade agreements that pursue the objective of liberalising trade between the Parties and to adopt provisions on trade-related issues. We have found a solution to the difficulties raised by the ACP States regarding the timetable for trade negotiations. Negotiations will start no later than 2002. This two-year preparatory period will be devoted to strengthening the process of regional integration and the capacity of the ACP countries to conduct trade negotiations. A period of six years is foreseen for the conduct of these negotiations. We will take into account the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways: first, by promoting social and human development policies that accompany economic and trade reforms and, second, by helping the ACP States to play an active role in the international economic and trading system through institutional capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral fora. This approach will lead us to a regime that is fully WTO compatible. Economic operators will tend to establish closer relations with ACP partners. Domestic and foreign investments will increase and there will be a greater transfer of know-how and technology, which will boost the competitiveness of ACP countries and facilitate their gradual integration into the world economy.	it
"In my view, the Commission would demonstrate balanced human resources management if it allayed some of these concerns, so that the liberalization of a sensitive sector such as postal services could be carried out under the calmest possible social conditions. Mr. President, it seems that postal services and post offices are a very hot topic in Parliament at the moment, and rightly so, given their importance. Just last week, in the UK Parliament at Westminster, the newly elected Member of Parliament from our European Free Alliance partners, Plaid Cymru, the Welsh party, made his maiden speech on this topic. A debate was also held recently in the Scottish Parliament, in which special reference was made to the role that post offices play, particularly in rural areas, in providing services and maintaining rural communities. Liberalization is not the only potential threat to postal services. Post offices in Scotland, as we have heard, are concerned with much more than merely dispatching the mail. Governments and some local authorities have traditionally used them as agencies for the payment of pensions and other benefits, as well as centers for the collection of housing rents, the collection of local taxes, and so on. But as the modernization of public financial systems increasingly leads to direct electronic monetary transactions to and from bank accounts, the viability of rural post offices is threatened. If a rural post office, usually linked to the only local shop, closes, it can pose a serious threat to the continuity of the community and to social inclusion. Rather than allowing post offices to be undermined by liberalization or the modernization of systems, governments, including the Commission, should be promoting and supporting the extensive network of post offices and viewing them as an asset that can be leveraged to provide public information and services from a location accessible to residents. Mr. President, the postal service has the task of ensuring that everywhere, in the city as well as in the most remote rural areas, the mail is delivered every day at the same rate for everyone. One hundred and fifty years ago, postal services were a public matter and, therefore, like public transport and energy supplies, constituted a fundamental task of public administrations. These highly useful and esteemed tasks gave citizens a reason to go and vote. Today, they show much less interest in an administration that no longer handles these tasks. I heard a Christian Democrat politician in a village in the Netherlands say: ""The mail belongs to everyone, and if you take it away from us, you are robbing us."" Meanwhile, the existing postal services gradually lost democratic control, and competition increasingly gave way. Newcomers are only interested in those aspects of the work where they can make the most profit with the lowest costs and at the lowest price. The only way they can remain the cheapest for any length of time is by compromising quality for customers and staff. These companies have always existed, but they were once banned, and now they are praised as a sign of progress."	es
However, I do have a slight concern, listening to the Commissioner, regarding the commitments made by the services in the Committee on Budgets. It had been clearly agreed - I am not saying that this is a good or a bad thing, but it was a contract - it had been clearly agreed between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7, that is to say, that there was an agreement on the idea of linking the mobilisation, the implementation, of the second tranche of macro-financial aid to the prior respect of the commitments made by the donors. However, I understood, listening to Mr Solbes, that this commitment had to be made in dotted lines. Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement. Yes or no, do you confirm the agreement reached by your services in the Committee on Budgets, or do you relax this conditionality, which would be a breach of commitment to us? No, Mr Bourlanges, I believe it is a fundamental problem. The problem is: how to implement the compromise we have accepted. What I proposed to you, and what I am still saying to you, is that the Commission will make a statement, in the Council decision, along the following lines: The exact amount and precise timetable for the second tranche will be decided in due course, taking due account of the evolution of Kosovo's external financing needs and the contributions of other bilateral donors. In this sense, we believe that we are fully respecting what we have agreed. I simply ask the Commission, before implementing the second tranche, to come and inform the Committee on Budgets. I fully agree, and we will do so. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. Altener The next item is the report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD)). Mr President, I thank Mr Langen - although he is not present here - for the work he has done to get the programme adopted by both Parliament and the Council. The project has been long and difficult. We must continue to promote, in particular, studies analysing the use of renewable energy sources. Although the new directive has many advantages, it also has its drawbacks. One example is the use of peat. Peat should not be classified in the same category as fossil fuels. While peat cannot be directly classified as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must be defined as a separate category, particularly with regard to environmental taxation. It is not fair to apply the same criteria to peat as to coal, for example. Promoting renewable energy sources is a partial solution to eliminating the Union's dependence on imported energy.	fr
Several questions remain unanswered, however. For example, the program does not seem to give any priority to the fight against AIDS. The situation in Africa has now become so serious that AIDS kills more people than armed conflicts. I hope the Minister will devote some of his time to this problem. Medicines exist in the United States, but the United States markets them at a price that is too high for the African population. I would like to ask the Minister what exactly he is doing about the situation developing in Ethiopia, where drought has set in, causing crop failure, and where, in six months, the scenario we experienced a few years ago will inevitably repeat itself, with famine and people dying by the thousands. Meanwhile, Eritrea and Ethiopia are at war, and the European arms industry does not hesitate to send rifles, after which we will send bread. Mr. Deputy, you will understand that I do not agree with your reading of my colleague's speech at the meeting of the Committee on Development; there is no contradiction between these positions, quite the contrary. Unless we are megalomaniacal, we could not, in our Presidency programme, engage in a sort of exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginable situations concerning all the major issues raised, particularly in the context of external relations. You will understand that nothing would have been easier. All we had to do was take a glossary on development and list all the points one after the other. We are responsible enough to see that we must only take the points that we can manage within the framework of our Presidency and what is – we must always be aware of this – the capacity of governments within the Council. We must see what the limits are to management, particularly of national indicative programmes. The Member mentioned the issue of Ethiopia, which falls within the framework of the National Indicative Programmes, but as you know, there are various Community actions to combat AIDS. You are right on this point, Mr. Deputy, the United States will probably not do any better. Furthermore, in terms of development aid policy, I think that Europe has no reason to be concerned simply because our behavior in this area has nothing to envy that of the United States. The Member's question arises from the issue of the arms problem; it is a question of a broader political nature, which does not seem to me to fall within the scope of this question, but which the Council will obviously consider in the future if it wishes and if it decides to place it in a specific context. Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food products by the European Union to developing countries below the production price?	fr
On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why not also create quotas based on age or ethnicity, quotas for Catholics, workers, people with glasses. The establishment of social quotas in favor of the most modest categories would be no stranger than the establishment of quotas for women. With such a philosophy, it would then no longer be necessary to organize elections or administrative competitions. It would be enough to determine the composition of ministries and assemblies based on statistical calculations. The policy of quotas can only increase voters' disaffection with politics by giving them, once again, the impression that everything happens without their knowledge. On the other hand, such a policy highlights a profound contempt for women. They must not have access to political or administrative functions based on automatic mechanisms linked to certain quotas, but rather based on the recognition of their merits and skills. Would you, ladies and gentlemen, be so devoid of pride as to be ready to accept a ministerial or elective office based on the purely mathematical calculations of a quota system? Women are worth much more than a quota. Only by basing ourselves on the principle of meritocracy will we improve the quantitative and qualitative presence of women in the decision-making process. Madam Minister, Madam Commissioner, I applaud your words even if some of the male colleagues still present in the Chamber may have something to say about them. I know that there are also women who do not want to hear about quotas or positive actions because they believe that such positive discrimination will humiliate and stigmatize them forever in their careers. However, the statistics prove it: positive actions, or quotas - if they are not applied blindly and without discernment - have increased the number of women in the decision-making process. This is why it is fair to point out that the use of quotas, on a transitional basis, helps to balance the participation of men and women, particularly in political life. I would like to take this opportunity to remind the Commissioner of some of the European Parliament's requests and initiatives that her predecessor has not yet followed up on and that are closer to our hearts than quotas. First of all, our report, adopted last year on International Women's Day in Strasbourg, which calls on the Commission to submit to the European Parliament a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment of men and women. Following the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was no longer any need to maintain positive action at the level of a tolerated derogation from the principle of equal treatment that recognises only an individual right and not a right that belongs to society which wants to achieve such equality in a democratic manner. As things stand today, it should be undeniable that the right to equality of women and men is a fundamental right of a democratic society which requires that equal treatment and equal opportunities be achieved through a set of active measures, including positive actions.	it
What was Mr. Giorgos Katiforis proposing to us that was omitted from the report? He proposed an ambitious report, in an optimistic Europe, that sought to establish numerical targets for the desired results. And Europe has made progress with numerical targets. Why, for example, was the proposal that Europe's labor force should grow toward 75% of the population omitted, when we currently have levels of around 60%? A labor force of 60% is very low compared to that of Japan or the United States, and we cannot produce the same as those countries with such a low employment rate. Therefore, we need to increase the employment rate with competitive jobs. As advocated for the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare a scientifically trained workforce for new technologies. And we need investment to increase at faster rates. This idea, defended by Mr. von Wogau, according to which what is needed is workforce flexibility, is an argument we are very familiar with. I would like to contrast the Portuguese example, where labor laws are not flexible and where the unemployment rate is less than 5%—and has been steadily declining in recent years—because investment is increasing (with Community support, obviously) at rates much higher than the Community average. Therefore, what we want is a Europe with economic growth, but with social concerns. Mr. President, I would like, like others, to thank Mr. Katiforis for this interesting report. Reading it, one gets a picture of the EU economy that, in my opinion, is quite alarming. Investment levels are too low, unemployment remains too high, and growth is insufficient. Therefore, it is perhaps not too surprising that the euro continues to lose ground against other currencies, despite rumors that the European Central Bank is secretly buying euros to stem its fall. The rapporteur confirms that stability in itself is not an objective, a view I share. There is too much talk of stability, convergence, and coordination, but too little about the factors that foster innovation and development. For me, the EMU collaboration is like an enormous colossus, unable to keep up with the rapid movements of the economy. My conclusions are completely different from those of the previous speaker. I believe we must invest in human resources, on the one hand, through a macro-policy that creates demand and new jobs, and on the other, through measures such as training, business democratization, and good social conditions. I see that, in these areas, the EMU project has its greatest weaknesses. We cannot build European economies from above, as if we were a new Baron von Münchhausen. On the contrary, we must mobilize workers and the people in the member countries.	es
In Tampere, the idea of also distributing operational powers was considered. We continue to call for a revision of the agreement to provide for better parliamentary and judicial oversight. The agreement should also be viewed critically with regard to EURODAC. Parliament modified the text of the treaty. It must be ensured that the Council conforms to Parliament's approach. Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet been launched on the other issues. We are currently still waiting for them. Europe, as an area of freedom, security, and justice, is still an area without clear regulations in important areas. However, we owe this to the citizens of Europe. After hearing the words of the Ministers of the Interior and Justice, I am optimistic. I expect that we will succeed in doing so in the next six months. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Mrs Terrón i Cusí's oral question hit the nail on the head. Six months after the inauguration of the newly elected Parliament, we must be in a position to send a firm political message to the citizens of Europe. I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can make a positive contribution to this. We are all now aware of the immense expectations our fellow citizens have regarding freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice. However, the citizens' disinterest, their distance, and sometimes even their aversion to politics, compel us to take concrete measures in the face of their difficulties. This is the essential prerequisite for reconciling citizens with politics. For Europe to become a symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a courageous and generous policy to help the weakest. A real plan to combat unemployment must be implemented, because this scourge is a breeding ground for racism, xenophobia, nationalism, and far-right racist movements. Among the most vulnerable—and it is important that I address this point—are immigrants and refugees. Thus, the almost universal detention and criminalization of asylum seekers can no longer be tolerated. Every asylum seeker must have the right to a fair hearing and to a suspensive appeal. Last week, quite by chance, I witnessed a scene of almost unsurpassable violence at Roissy Airport, in which two young women, who had apparently entered the country clandestinely, were deported to Conakry. They were treated like serious criminals. They were naked, dragged across the floor by their hair, and guarded by a horde of CRS riot police. The Portuguese presidency must put an end to such barbaric practices. On the contrary, our task is to accompany, assist, and offer security to those fleeing dictatorship. The Commission proposed the creation of a European fund for refugees. Parliament warmly welcomed this proposal. Instead of endlessly debating the amount of money allocated to this fund, I believe you should decide to create it. The Presidency and the Council can give concrete form to the points that were inexplicably rejected at Tampere, even though Tampere provides an important foundation. Likewise, we cannot simply state that xenophobia is on the rise in Europe and discrimination is becoming more and more commonplace without taking comprehensive measures to counteract it.	de
The final demand concerns the future powers of the European Parliament in the areas under discussion here: competition policy and state aid, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference. As you know, Commissioner, our report puts forward the idea that the codecision procedure should apply to the adoption of fundamental legal texts on state aid. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my part in today's debate concerns the Steel Aid Code. This covers public aid in Europe that was awarded under this code and that the Commission has examined. There were a total of 27 cases in 1998. The Commission submitted a separate report on these cases. The ECSC Treaty will soon expire. Therefore, the question that must concern us today is, in particular, how steel aid will be handled in the future. The European Parliament welcomes the decisions of the European Commission set out in the report, including the decision to reclaim funds in one specific case, thereby applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty. The competitiveness of the European steel industry is also the subject of the Commission's most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament. As in other sectors, the iron and steel industry is subject to the general prohibition of state aid under Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty. According to this article, state aid is generally incompatible with the common market. Exceptions are permitted only in precisely defined cases. Article 88 obliges the Commission to monitor state aid. In 1998, the largest case was the injection of equity capital to PREUSSAG in Germany amounting to EUR 540 million. Furthermore, Member States must notify the Commission of their planned aid in advance. The applicable rules for the steel industry were established on December 18, 1996. According to this, aid to the steel industry may only be granted in certain, precisely defined cases. These include research and development aid, environmental protection aid, social aid to encourage the closure of steelworks, and aid for the permanent closure of uncompetitive companies. In addition, there is a special arrangement of up to €50 million for the Member State of Greece. However, there have evidently been problems with the practical implementation of the Steel Aid Code in recent years that were not fully discussed in the report. From Parliament's point of view, it is important that discussions begin today about a follow-up arrangement following the expiry of this Steel Aid Code. A weakening of the existing basic principles of the Steel Code must not be decided upon. No one wants an unrestrained subsidy race in Europe. This would significantly impair the internal market, even after the consolidation of the steel industry in recent years. Therefore, Parliament considers it necessary for the Steel Subsidy Code to be amended in light of the unequal treatment alleged by the industry, and for the Commission to submit a successor regulation to the Council. It is well known that the Council has so far refused to adopt such a successor regulation. This is partly due to the belief that once the Steel Aid Code expires, one can once again do what one pleases without the burdensome control of the European Commission. We therefore demand that, after the expiration of the Treaty, steel aid must be regulated by a Council Regulation pursuant to Article 94, because this is the only way to ensure the necessary legal binding force and clarity.	de
As Members of Parliament, we must particularly emphasize that the process initiated to strengthen fundamental rights is more important than ever, because the respect and inviolability of human values and the rights of minorities, including the rights of all people living in the territory of the European Union, are an essential component of the principle of the rule of law in the European Union. Therefore, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must also be legally binding. It must not remain a mere declaration. Equally important is the support of democratic forces in Austria; none of us wants to exclude Austria. We know that most Austrians respect these values. They have also demonstrated; not all of these demonstrations have taken place outside Austria. Certainly, there are also many protest voters who have long wanted a change in Austrian politics. In my opinion, Parliament must support these democratic forces. I also appeal to the Austrian President to explore all possibilities so that a government made up of democratic forces can be formed. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to emphasize the importance of a stance such as that just evoked by the chairman of our group, Francis Wurtz. I welcome the statements by the Council Presidency and the 14 Member States, which reject official bilateral contacts with the Austrian government if Jörg Haider's party participates in the government. Our insistence on this is all the more significant given that, as is well known, we fundamentally disagree with the policies of the European Union—its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit, or the involvement of its Member States in the dramatic Balkan war. This disagreement lends even more weight to our recognition today: it is exceptional in that the danger of the rebirth of a perverse neo-fascist component in Europe is exceptional. This danger does not concern Austria, but Europe. We are speaking of ourselves, not of Austria. We are aware of the social causes that, together with unemployment and insecurity, contribute to fueling tendencies in this direction; We are aware of the cultural secondary causes, such as ethnic hatred and racism, but we cannot avoid pointing out that the inability and unwillingness of those right-wing extremist forces to reckon with fascism could create an explosive mixture in Europe. This concerns the Alpine region, all our countries: conditions are being created that could once again pose a threat to democracy and European civilization. With its statement, the Council Presidency has made it clear that it is aware of this dramatic situation for civilization. Europe is proving that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is encountering a soul. Now, however, it must be consistent and act accordingly, and first of all, the Commission must be consistent. Instead, in this case, it has adopted an unclear and indecisive stance, which makes the significance of the Council Presidency's statement even more obvious. In this sense, the Commission's actions must be corrected. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as regards the fundamental democratic principle of respect for human rights and for the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, which is opposed to any form of fascism, Nazism or communism, new or old - and all my previous speakers have spoken about the sovereignty of the Austrian people - we note that this sovereignty is being denied today, precisely by our Parliament.	de
Nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect workers, nothing to prevent large companies from plunging part of the population into poverty simply to enrich their shareholders! If this report has any merit, it is that it has made it clear that the working majority of society has nothing to hope for from the European institutions in terms of maintaining, let alone improving, their living conditions. (FR) By voting against this report, we speak for all those in Seattle and throughout Europe who have expressed their rejection of a world reduced to a pure market logic. We vote against this report in the name of the development of public services, and above all in memory of the victims of the Paddington train crash, whose deaths were not an inevitable fate but the result of the absurd desire to give priority to competition where regulation is needed. This report is essentially a primitive piece of work, inspired by nothing other than the law of the jungle, because competition cannot solve any of the problems facing humanity at the beginning of the new century. Whether it be the balance of the biosphere, the promotion of culture, or cooperation with the developing world, unbridled competition is a factor of regression and insecurity. Do you perhaps think that Europe's 18 million unemployed are victims of an overly timid application of this competition policy? We are convinced of the opposite, and we do not believe that state aid is fundamentally too high. According to what iron rule, according to what criteria of effectiveness, should it be set? Finally, after Seattle, do you consider it serious to advocate a greater role for the WTO? Such stubbornness suits only the legal advisers of multinational corporations. Jonckheer report (A5-0087/1999). (FR) I welcome the quality of the Seventh Report on State Aid in the EU, the fact that it is now published annually, and the fact that the Directorate-General for Competition is providing general information intended for the public on its website. I am pleased with the rapporteur's approach to State aid. There is too often a tendency to condemn State aid as a measure that distorts competition. An effective competition policy is certainly a prerequisite for the proper functioning of the internal market and of Economic and Monetary Union. However, as the rapporteur points out, such aid is often essential, not only as a contribution to the survival of one undertaking or another, but also to sustainable development (Article 6 of the EC Treaty), to services of general interest (Article 16), and to economic and social cohesion (Article 158). But it must, of course, be monitored, and this is the task of the European Commission. The annual aid granted by EU Member States to the eligible sectors totaled €95 billion between 1995 and 1997, of which 40% went to the manufacturing sector. This aid decreased significantly compared to the previous period, 1993 and 1995 (a decrease of 13% of the total amount and between 3.8% and 2.6% of the aid volume for the manufacturing sector). The decrease in aid is mainly due to the reduction in aid to the new German Länder.	de
"It must also be clarified what to do if state aid is declared unlawful. How can we ensure that unlawful state aid is repaid? Currently, there are no common rules in this area, and we urge the Commission to ensure the harmonization of repayment rules. This is the right way to create a level playing field. We are also proposing, as several colleagues have already mentioned, a register and a ""scoreboard"" showing countries' levels of state aid. We have taken up your suggestion here, Mr. Monti, regarding the Internal Market Scoreboard. This has inspired us to propose the same for state aid. I very much hope, Commissioner Monti, that you will support this proposal, and I look forward to your comments and your opinion. Finally, I welcome the Commission's 28th Competition Report, which, like previous reports, is well done. However, as I have said, our primary objective must be transparency and openness. We must continually develop the transparency and openness of state aid and focus our efforts on these areas. This is important, not least in view of the upcoming enlargement. I would like to thank Mr. Jonckheer, who addresses the associated problems very thoroughly in his report. He examines how we can ensure that these countries meet our requirements, but also how a level playing field can be created. Of course, Liberals and Greens have different views on how the world should be, but we largely agree on the objectives and will try to find a sensible solution to our problems. Mr. President, Commissioner, we simply have two questions to answer. Is state aid to companies or agreements between companies legitimate in a market economy, and who should monitor these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy? On the first point, we state quite clearly that if the requirements of sustainable development, which the European Union is pursuing, are to be taken into account, companies must be granted state aid, whether in the form of tax exemptions, differentiated taxation, or simply direct aid. It is equally legitimate for there to be agreements between companies or voluntary restraint agreements that make it possible to reduce the negative effects of competition on social or environmental requirements. We therefore state clearly and unequivocally that, yes, it is legitimate for aid to exist and that agreements can be made, but we also say that each of these agreements must be explicitly justified. The von Wogau report proposes transferring control of the legitimacy of such measures to national competence. While we see a certain risk in this, we will nevertheless vote for it because we recognize that the Commission cannot do everything. We demand that this be done with the utmost transparency and that the Commission be granted greater investigative powers to retrospectively review the legitimacy of these exemptions. Mr. President, once again we are debating the European Union's competition policy. But under what conditions is this debate actually taking place, and what conclusions should we draw?"	de
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is dire and worsening; in most cases, there are no hot meals available all day. The Russian authorities no longer provide them, so it's the non-governmental organizations that are taking care of it. In Grozny, there are currently around 20,000 people in a truly desperate situation; they have to walk for miles to find food. But there is something that could be described as a positive development, which I would also like to share with you. The Representative of the Council of Europe informed me that, during a meeting with the President and the Foreign Minister yesterday evening, the Russian authorities accepted the inclusion of Council of Europe staff in the humanitarian mission currently under the leadership of the Russian authorities in Grozny, and that they are in negotiations with the Presidency-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) so that, if necessary, staff from that organization could also be included. This is the only positive news I can convey to you at the moment; I hope that in the next few hours we will receive further information from the representative, Mr Gil-Robles, and above all, better news regarding the authorities of the Russian Federation. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will conclude by simply repeating what I said at the beginning. It is a great satisfaction to be able to take part in the work of this Parliament, to collaborate with you in the work which is being carried out jointly by all the Member States and together with the Commission, and whose clear aim is to enable our European Union to participate with the greatest possible weight in peacekeeping operations at international level. Europe's purpose is not to wage war anywhere, but to work together to ensure peace and stability throughout the world. I would like to thank Mr Solana very warmly and give the floor to Mr Poettering on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats. Thank you, Mr Poettering. It goes without saying that a contribution from Commissioner Patten in this debate would be extremely appropriate. And we have agreed that I will give him the floor as soon as he wishes. Would you like to speak now, Commissioner, or a little later? (The Commissioner indicates that he would like to speak later.) Very well, thank you. Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Javier Solana! We are not a local person, but the opposite. We welcome the rapid progress achieved following the Helsinki Summit. It is well known what an important role you played in this. I am also pleased that you mentioned Mozambique in this context and the substantial humanitarian aid that can be provided with these resources. Of course, we cannot talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya. My friend Jacques Poos will speak on this later on behalf of our group. I would like to concentrate on Kosovo at this point. The situation in Kosovo shows only too clearly that military means cannot bring about a long-term solution to the crisis there. KFOR forces have provided and continue to provide important and invaluable services there, but armored vehicles and anti-personnel defenses cannot, in the long run, solve political problems and ethnic conflicts.	de
The Council consults us and Parliament gives its opinion. We want an Intergovernmental Conference, but not this one. Is an IGC necessary? Of course, but not of this type. We need to go much further in the agenda, we need to be much more daring in the issues that the Intergovernmental Conference will address, we need greater transparency and greater democracy. Greater democracy means ensuring greater participation by Parliament, allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes - its capacity for initiative. It is also a question of setting clear objectives. The functionalist method has run its course, for better or for worse. We have come this far with the functionalist method. We have undoubtedly achieved results, but now we need to make a qualitative leap; in politics, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this means persuading the other Community partners that the worst thing now would be short-sightedness. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at this point, having come to the end of the debate to which I have listened with great attention and interest, I would like to make a few reflections to complement the orientations and speeches that I have had the honour of giving before you in recent weeks, alongside President Prodi. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, in their report, the fruit of extremely precise and serious work, have proposed that Parliament adopt a formal opinion, pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty, so that, thanks to the adoption of that opinion, the Intergovernmental Conference can actually start on 14 February, as proposed by the Portuguese Presidency. For our part, having, pursuant to the same Article 48 of the Treaty, drawn up the opinion requested from the Commission, we are satisfied that this Conference can be started, among other things earlier than we had initially imagined. We know, and I am also aware of this, that the coming weeks will all be extremely useful. I would simply like to make a few observations based on the reading of the draft opinion and the interventions of the speakers from the various groups. First of all, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understands the concerns expressed by many of you about the breadth of the agenda of the Conference. I understand this concern and the fear that the agenda is too full. However, I believe that we can work, as I already said in the aftermath of Helsinki before the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the basis of the Helsinki mandate. It is with this in mind and within the framework of this mandate, using all its phrases and all its interlinearities, that the Commission has worked on drawing up its opinion. We have not limited ourselves to what are improperly called the three left-overs. Like Mr Corbett, I too do not like the term 'left-over', which gives the impression that these are three minor or unimportant issues. Instead, these are three extremely serious, important and difficult issues, so demanding that in Amsterdam the collective political courage to deal with them in depth was lacking. For our part - I am responding to the Honourable Member Seguro, who just expressed his concern about this issue - we have not been satisfied with addressing these three aspects, even though we consider them to be priorities and worthy of being addressed now.	it
"This is in line with the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding Treaties of our Union. Marinho report (A5-0003/2000): . (SV) The main task of the upcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU in the face of the accession of new Member States. It is therefore obvious that we support the European Parliament's formal approval of the holding of this Conference. However, we believe that the Intergovernmental Conference should limit itself to matters necessary for the implementation of enlargement. We held the same view in November 1999, and for this reason, we wish to refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999. . (FR) In the opinion it has just adopted on the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament calls for ""launching a constitutional process."" This desire to place all nations under a legally superior text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body charged with drafting a so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is in reality a disguised constitution. It is even expressed in the incredible drift of the European Parliament, which today, through a resolution, seeks to erase the results of the free elections held in Austria. The same desire to reduce nations to the level of mere subordinate administrative regions is transparent in every page of the report prepared by the commission for the Intergovernmental Conference. The main idea is to generalize qualified majority voting, while modifying the content of this qualified majority to transform it into a simple double majority of the States and the people, in order to increase the Commission's room for maneuver and reduce that of minority states. The French will undoubtedly be very interested to know, in passing, that the Commission is requesting the amendment of Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to introduce majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament. Let us recall that this article, which deals with the transfer of immigration policy within the EU, stipulated that for five years, decisions would have to be taken unanimously by the Council, which would then assess the possible opportunity to modify the system. In France, in the National Assembly and the Senate, at the time of ratification, many parliamentarians were reassured that the Council would in any case have the freedom to choose and could maintain unanimity. However, today, the very Minister of European Affairs who prepared the Amsterdam Treaty and who, years later, has become a European Commissioner, Mr. Barnier, is proposing that at the next Intergovernmental Conference, the Council should address these matters by majority. This is the kind of mechanism to which we are constantly subjected when European integration is played out with the Brussels institutions. The French must be aware that not only is the goal of all these operations to dismantle their country as a center of responsible decision-making, but also that every means will be used to wrest their consent."	es
"The two great resources of the Atlantic coast, closely interconnected: fishing and tourism, have both been severely affected. There is a risk of losing the season and dragging on into an extremely serious crisis at the end of the year. It was therefore fully justified for our Parliament to draft a new resolution, to which our group has made a significant contribution, emphasizing several points that we consider to be of the utmost importance on the ground. The first is that polluters must assume full responsibility. Our resolution calls for the application of two principles: that of ""the polluter cleans up,"" as it is unacceptable that the cleanup of coasts polluted by a cargo of hydrocarbons should not be the responsibility of the owner, but rather of public authorities, that is, the taxpayers, that is, the victims. The second principle is that of ""the polluter pays."" This responsibility, as stipulated in our resolution, must also extend to the fishing and aquaculture sectors and companies. This is essential; This means that the polluter cannot claim to limit the amount of compensation for victims to the maximum set by the FIPOL, that is, to the goodwill of the major oil companies. If the FIPOL ceiling is insufficient, and it is clearly underestimated, it must be increased. This is what our resolution calls for. And if the increase is insufficient, the polluter must finance the remainder. It would be particularly iniquitous for an oil company, whose profits this year amount to 10 billion francs, to refuse to compensate 100% of its own victims, the vast majority of whom are small businesses and workers. The hard-hit communities, Commissioner, expect concrete signs of solidarity at the European level. Our resolution calls on the Commission to take measures to help repair the damage caused to the fishing sector affected by the consequences of the disaster. Blue Europe, the CFP, must now show that, beyond the obligations it imposes on fishermen, solidarity is not a word it ignores. The European Union must also participate in environmental restoration in affected wetlands and coastal areas whose biological value is of interest to the entire Union. Mr. Fischler has just told us that he would welcome France's requests, something I welcome. On this essential issue of marine pollution, we must act as a catalyst. Twenty years after the Amoco Cádiz disaster, laxity and irresponsibility regarding maritime safety continue to reign supreme in Europe, along with their consequences: new oil spills. This time, inertia must not prevail. We must quickly define a general framework for maritime safety, respecting the principle of subsidiarity, and finally put an end to this infernal spiral of widespread irresponsibility. Mr. President, the economy of the western Atlantic is in ruins, covered in fuel oil from the Erika. Fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, tourism professionals, and local and regional authorities are impatiently waiting for aid, as well as for treatment of the hull, which apparently continues to leak and is a veritable time-delay bomb."	es
In that case, obviously, no reciprocity is established in favor of European UCITS. We will also oppose the removal of the right of States to increase the rate to 35%... (The President cuts the speaker off) Mr. President, this matter is of fundamental importance for Europe. A Europe facing the imminent pensions time bomb must take all necessary measures to encourage savings and optimize the benefits that the people of Europe can derive from their savings. I welcome many of the advances in Mr. Schmidt's report. UCITS are a great success in the European Union. They constitute a safe product that can be marketed across borders. But the time has come to update the legislation. Mr. Schmidt has done excellent work in this regard. It is no secret that, personally, I would have much preferred if Mr. Schmidt's report had not been so amended as it passed through Parliament. But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach to this issue. The radical measure advocated in this report is to allow UCITS to use OTC derivatives. I appeal to everyone here to assess the products that these UCITS will use. We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce the risks and increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans. Mr. Schmidt deserves to be applauded for securing Parliament's support for over-the-counter derivatives. We must not be afraid to move forward and react to changes in the market. Yes, we must continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumers. The report provides very adequate consumer protection. But some of the amendments go too far in limiting the use of OTC derivatives. I believe that these derivatives will be added to the portfolio of unit trusts, which can only help people across Europe achieve high returns on their savings. I greet Mr. Schmidt. Thank you very much, Mr. Kuckelkorn. Dear colleagues, I can now give you an initial answer on the question of the curtain and the window. If we open the curtain, we will find a protective screen that cannot be easily removed. I am afraid, therefore, that we will have to postpone the experiment until the next plenary session. I will try to find out at that time what the room looks like with the curtain open. Mr. President, since its entry into force on 1 October 1989, the UCITS Directive has been a great success, thanks in particular to the very high level of protection it guarantees to investors. The investment fund industry has increased its assets fivefold in the European Union, taking advantage of the directive and the positive image of UCITS among investors. The cross-border marketing of investments within the European Union has seen rapid growth, and the directive itself has become a model piece of legislation worldwide. But it's clear that, after ten years, given the development of markets and the availability of increasingly sophisticated new financial products, the directive is somewhat outdated.	es
Will the legal basis today be sufficient to legally justify the creation of a new, specifically Community-based criminal law which, although subsidiary, will always be in competition, in practice and in certain areas, with the traditional and fragmented criminal law of the Member States? Given the doubts, would it not be more correct to include the reform of the judicial system on the agenda of the IGC, introducing these proposals into the more general reform of the Union's judicial system, similar to what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor? Are these matters not of the utmost importance for a revision of the Treaties which contributes to the solidity of the area of Freedom, Security and Justice in the Union? Mr President, the EU is today the subject of strict surveillance. Confidence in the European Union has deteriorated considerably. Strong measures are needed to remedy this. We therefore welcome the increased resources allocated to OLAF, in order to effectively address all suspicions. At the same time, we consider it self-evident that those who have committed criminal acts against the EU should be held accountable. It is regrettable that the Convention on the Protection of the Economic Interests of the Union is applied by only a small number of Member States. We therefore believe that it would be a good idea for the Commission to be given the task of putting forward proposals that involve developing the existing legal framework. However, I am not convinced that these efficiency gains should be achieved by implementing common European legislation or centralising the fight against this type of crime. In this context, I am therefore sceptical about the creation of a European Public Prosecutor's office, which I believe would be very difficult to achieve within the framework of the current Treaty. We have greater faith in the Eurojust programme, which enables national prosecutors to work together. The main problem is not the lack of prosecutions for criminal acts committed against the Union, but the fact that such acts occur so frequently and are so rarely discovered. The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves, however, is to find the right balance. The fraud and negligence that do occur must not result in us being locked into an outdated, hierarchical bureaucracy, where excessive control over details prevents the development of a modern administration. We therefore welcome the aggressive approach that characterises the Van Hulten report. The policy to be followed must aim at giving each administration responsibility for its own supervision. Our experience of modern administrative functioning shows that openness, decentralisation of responsibilities and truly competent evaluation are just as effective as bureaucratic and meticulous supervision. The major challenge here is to create a modern and efficient administration without losing anything in terms of legal certainty or our capacity for control. This requires specific training, more modern recruitment methods, and above all, transparency and openness of the system. The best protection against irregularities is the possibility of effective supervision of the administration.	fr
This has been under discussion for four years now. The Commission must change its internal organizational structures and strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its measures. Ideally, this could be achieved through a special working group on landmines, endowed with the necessary financial resources. Furthermore, faster contracting and implementation procedures, an expanded multiannual budget line, and significantly improved management of the programs launched by the Commission would be necessary. A proper evaluation of the effectiveness of landmine clearance programs must be carried out in every country where landmines pose a serious problem. In my view, the landmine problem also encompasses many of the organizational, procedural, operational, and financial management difficulties facing the Commission and the Union. Are these problems a thing of the past, or will we find that the European Union is still unable to achieve its objectives, even in this relatively compact and limited area? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new EU-ACP agreement is an important step towards greater coherence. And it is good that criteria such as human rights, democracy, the rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than before, that former colonial relations no longer shape the majority of our relations, but that these political criteria have been given greater weight here. Because that is the prerequisite for any development. If these criteria are not met, then development has no chance. That, Mr. Modrow, also applies to Cuba. I welcome the fact that Cuba is moving closer to this process. But for that to happen, a great deal of change must also take place in Cuba. We are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International. It may well be that you, as one of the last rulers of communism, see things somewhat differently than large sections of this House, and that you have problems with good governance. Nevertheless, this is an important criterion for the European Union. I would like to address a second topic. We are talking about coherence here. Many colleagues have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are incoherent. But in my view, development policy as such also needs more coherence. It is incoherent if coordination with the Member States still does not work, if, in some developing countries, Member States and the European Union are implementing very contradictory projects. It is also incoherent towards the European taxpayer if we pursue a development policy that is included in the Union budget, but the EDF remains outside it. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if you ensure that these EUR 13.5 billion are in future subject to scrutiny by Parliament, the Committee on Budgetary Control, and mechanisms such as OLAF, then I believe you will increase the level of acceptance. I think that this should also be a demand for the Intergovernmental Conference: the anchoring of the EDF in the European Union budget. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although we believe that this text is well-intentioned overall, we did not vote in favour of it in committee and we will not be voting in favour of it in plenary either, for two reasons which, incidentally, have led us to table a number of amendments which I would like to outline very briefly.	de
"Faced with this neoliberal globalization, dominated by financial markets, the demand, as evidenced by our request, is growing for another idea of the world, according to which the common law would be that dictated by the duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world. No one can ignore the challenge to civilization posed by the lack of nearly a billion jobs. The need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to knowledge. In this regard, all ideas deserve consideration, and we believe that the Tobin tax is an important one, as are other forms of transactions that are conceivable. This tax can help curb speculation without penalizing the activities of the real economy and help free up new resources for human investments, at a time when the UNDP estimates that $40 billion a year is needed to eradicate poverty, provide access to drinking water for all, and meet health needs. As the debate is launched on a global scale on the capacity of politics to influence the economic sphere, the introduction of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political will to reconquer the democratic spaces confiscated by international financial operators. And I would like to respond to the Commissioner who said that a minimum number of industrial countries was needed to achieve this. It seems to me that the European Union is made up of a significant number of industrial countries and I believe, like Harlem Désir and several other speakers, that the European Union that we form can take the initiative in this regard. In any case, I believe that the European Parliament would do itself honor by echoing the desire of citizens to control the world in the sense of well-being for all. Madam President, I too welcome the holding of this debate, which is long overdue. We know very well that each generation, over time, has blindly fallen into what one might call a dominant ideology, that is to say a set of prejudices accepted as such by the ambient conformism and which, however, end up revealing to subsequent generations how fraught with tragedy they have been. Free trade and the permanent beatification of globalization constitute, in our eyes, the dominant ideology of today, that is to say the great error of our end of century, as dangerous as was once the ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin, or, long before, the certainty erected into dogma that the earth was flat. Our world is today dominated by a single logic, I was going to say a single god, that of money at work and not of man at work. With the exchange of goods and services amounting to 36,000 billion francs, the product of only four days of speculation, the financial bubble no longer owes much to the productive activity of individuals. It feeds on itself in a bidding war that constantly denies, everywhere, the humanity of man, that of the rich as much as that of the poor, even if it is the latter who, in the end, find themselves excluded from most of the planet's decision-making centers, which are monopolized by a tiny minority, what Jean-Pierre Chevènement recently aptly named: ""the globalized elites."""	fr
I too would like to compliment Mrs Hudghton on her report and support her changes to the original proposal both in relation to the issue of compensation and in relation to the development of a vaccine. I think that Amendments 7 to 13 are not acceptable and in particular I believe that Amendment 13 not only goes against the aims of the proposal but could make the situation even more difficult than it is under the current rules. This is not to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming. Mrs Hudghton has already mentioned the final report of the joint UK Government and industry working group on infectious salmon anaemia and the measures that are important for all fish farms, not just those affected by the virus. Secondly, as the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report is being adopted this evening, paragraph 28 is of particular importance. This paragraph calls on the Commission and the Member States to step up measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment. Thirdly, in line with what has been said previously about the collection of fisheries data, I hope that the Commission will launch projects and studies looking at aquaculture in the environmental context; this is the approach that should be taken in relation to the environment and not the one suggested by Amendments Nos 7 to 13, which I hope the honourable Members will reject. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with the chorus of satisfaction expressed by my colleagues who are delighted at the watering down of a directive that respects the precautionary principle and that lays down provisions to protect the health of consumers. Infectious salmon disease, caused by an orthomyxomicrovirus that breaks down the blood of salmon and kills them, spreads very easily in salt water through mucus, etc. The 1993 directive allows not only sick fish but the entire herd to be slaughtered, just as, when a cow is sick, for reasons related to the precautionary principle, the entire herd is slaughtered. Now we are being proposed to soften this directive so that not the entire herd is slaughtered, but only the fish declared sick. As for the others, we should wait for the course of events, acting according to local circumstances. I think it is very serious to proceed in this way and, in this regard, I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to the fact that we cannot be satisfied with stating that a temperature of 27ºC has all the advantages for the human race and that, therefore, men are not at risk. And what about women? No studies have been carried out in this sense on human tissue. There is also a risk for the environment, because we know that the disease has an incubation period in salmon and that, therefore, when these fish are consumed, they can be healthy carriers of the virus, thus constituting a danger. And this is not the only risk to the environment, as the disease is transmitted, as we have seen, to non-farmed fish. All this has led me, together with my colleague Patricia McKenna, to table some amendments against the Commission's proposals.	it
"We would like to go further on a number of points. That is why we will vote for Amendments 102, 103 and 104 proposed by the Green Group, which we believe will further improve our position on these issues. As regards water pricing policy, extreme situations sometimes arise that require exceptions to the principles set out in the report. Personally, I believe that Amendment No 43 from the Environment Committee provides for the necessary exceptions, and that the wording on this subject is even more satisfactory in Amendment No 105 from the Green Group. I do not believe it is necessary to provide for exceptions applicable to cases other than those indicated in these two proposals. However, opinions on this subject are divided within our group. Amendment No 107, which addresses this issue, has been accepted by a number of us. Overall, I believe that the Environment Committee's proposal, as submitted to us in the Lienemann report, is valid and can provide a good basis for reaching a difficult compromise. Mr President, every satellite photo proves that we do indeed inhabit the blue planet: this abundance, however, is an illusion. The very recent disaster on the Danube reminds us that rivers and streams are the lifeblood of our planet and that pollution knows no bounds. Water is a renewable and limited natural resource. It becomes scarce when it is not well managed and when geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable. Within the Union, this issue is of crucial importance in the Mediterranean region, but also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying up of wetlands. Sensitive, humid or arid areas, inequalities between States, inequalities between different regions within States, climatic, economic, geographical and geological particularities, are all obvious points that we wish to recall, but which must not, however, lead to distortions of competition in the Community. We have, however, tabled amendments to recall the importance of the specific relationship between agriculture and water, a key factor in the occupation and development of the territory. It is understood that the needs of agriculture in the South are much greater and that this specificity must be taken into account in this framework directive. Moreover, it is not only in the States of the Union that solutions to these problems are being sought: the countries of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, in Turin in October, directly called for a Marshall Plan on water for the southern coast of the Mediterranean. Fortunately, we are not there yet. In Europe, however, there are droughts, desertification in certain regions, but also floods, and the directive clearly highlights this. We have suffered from this recently in France, and also in the Rhine Valley and in Central Europe. We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy that must make the different uses of water compatible with each other. But it is necessary to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management. The ""water"" issue will not be closed today in any case. Indeed, the issue of enlargement and climate change are opening up new perspectives."	fr
In addition to water quality, its quantity is also important, as there is not enough of it throughout Europe, especially in regions with very arid zones. I regret that the Commissioner who is actually responsible for this matter, Ms. Wallström, cannot be here, as this is certainly an extremely important directive, on which the Commission has been working for a very long time, and the legislation for water protection, which is being debated today at second reading, affects all citizens of the European Union and also all inhabitants of the candidate countries, who will have to comply with EU legislation upon accession. We have been working on this issue for ten years, and this comprehensive approach only became possible after a hearing initiated and organized in 1994 by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. From that time until today's second reading, many people have worked hard on the issue in the European Parliament, the European Commission, and the Council of Ministers. We managed to reduce the 243 amendments from the Committee on the Environment to 27, to which, however, another 30 have now been added. As you can see, many and very diverse aspirations are at stake. Some seek to tighten the provisions, others seek greater precision, and many are driven by national interests. In my political group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)/European Democrats, there were naturally also different points of view. Our approach is to try to establish realistic objectives and practically applicable solutions. Some of the amendments that I and some other colleagues have tabled on behalf of our group undoubtedly improve, from that perspective, the requirements proposed in the common position. Some amendments, which we support, aim to strengthen the European Parliament's negotiating position in the subsequent conciliation with the Council of Ministers. We clearly reject all unrealistic demands, which undermine the European Parliament's credibility. Among these, I include the requirement for zero entry of hazardous substances, that is, the requirement that this be reduced to zero by 2020. This would mean the end of all agricultural activities and many industrial activities. In this context, I would like to emphasize once again that, despite everything, we have already made considerable progress with the national and European water protection laws currently in place, however incomplete they may be and even though the Member States have poorly respected them. I just want to point out that we now have salmon in the Rhine, something that would have been unthinkable 20 years ago, and that even in the Elbe, which suffered from a particularly high pollutant load, salmon will be introduced again. This does not mean that we do not have to continue making enormous efforts to continue improving water protection and to maintain the surface and groundwater that are still in good condition, which will undoubtedly also entail high costs. Just in recent days, many concerns have been expressed from the agricultural sector. Agriculture, too, needs sufficient, clean water to thrive. With the guidance our Group has maintained in the negotiations with the Council of Ministers, it will be possible to reach a solution favorable to agriculture as well.	es
We need more police forces; the existing forces are completely insufficient. We need an independent judiciary—which will certainly be difficult to establish—as well as funds for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. All this must be done, and quickly. If we do not provide assistance quickly, the situation will deteriorate, and new conflicts and crisis situations could result. That is why I think we did well to act quickly, to accept the urgency, and to release funds. However, we want to see action and successes in Kosovo, and I urge the Commission to ensure the proper use of these resources, particularly with regard to the development of the police and the establishment of the justice system. Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the Members, and in particular the rapporteur, for the promptness with which they have dealt with this subject. This will undoubtedly enable us to disburse aid quickly and address the concerns that Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have expressed to us. It seems to me that three basic types of concern have emerged from this evening's debate. Firstly, although much progress has been made in this respect - we could mention customs administration, banking administration, tax administration - it is true that we still have some way to go. To finance what? This is the first point where we see a certain divergence. In one of your amendments, you suggest establishing in a more limited way the type of institutions to which the Union's funding contribution refers. For example, Amendments Nos 3 and 5. However, in our view, in both cases, greater room for manoeuvre should be given to the UN administration, which is more familiar with the situation on the ground than we are. We believe that predetermining the destination of resources at this time would create additional practical difficulties. Ultimately, we will have to place our trust in those on the ground who can make certain decisions better than we would. The second concern, which I believe some of you share—it was Mr. Bourlanges who expressed it first, but others have also expressed it—concerns the problem of other donors. Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are not implementing their cooperation? Some amendments in your report go in this direction. Amendments 1, 2, and 4, for example. I would say to Mr. Bourlanges and those who raised this point that the fundamental problem does not lie in the spirit, which we completely share. The fundamental problem is that it is true that the distribution of effort between the various donors is currently based on the declarations of the high-level steering group, but it is no less true that these have no legal value; they constitute only a political commitment. This is why we would ask, and we have also provided a note to Mr Brok to this effect, that Amendment 1, the spirit of which we accept, be worded differently, so that it does not imply any conditionality on the provision of Community resources.	fr
Mr President, Dear rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteurs, who have succeeded in producing well-founded reports in a short space of time. Nevertheless, my group has criticized the timing of the committee's work. The reports were submitted late, and, moreover, they were dealt with in a great hurry, at least in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. This missed good opportunities to discuss the results of previous programs, good practices, and shortcomings. In connection with the INTERREG program, our group would like to highlight the cross-border activities, particularly cooperation beyond the Union's external borders. Important regions in this regard include the Balkans and the Adriatic, but I believe cooperation with Russia should not be forgotten. My group therefore reiterates the problem of practical monitoring of the funds and stresses the need for better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA, and PHARE programs. This is currently lacking, and the Commission has not yet put forward any concrete proposals for improving coordination. Parliament expects the Commission to present a detailed study on this to our committee as soon as possible. The involvement of businesses, organizations, and other stakeholders is crucial for practical implementation. Based on previous experience, cooperation projects require better planning, more precise monitoring, and a more results-oriented implementation. Projects often stall halfway through, their effectiveness stymied by administrative and bureaucratic red tape. We must also demand a binding commitment to the projects from our cooperation partners and the fulfillment of their share. Our group resubmits several amendments that were rejected during committee discussion. In this context, I would also like to refer again to the URBAN report, in the explanatory statement of which the rapporteur thankfully also addresses the minimum amount of EUR 500 per inhabitant set out in the Commission's guidelines. This cannot work as a blanket target. Rather, it must be possible to determine this amount according to the conditions in the respective target area. This aspect is so important that it should appear in the conclusions rather than the explanatory memorandum. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all structural funds. Projects are not intended to be supported solely in one region or country, but in neighboring regions in two or more countries. Unfortunately, this only applies to part of the money, namely only those within the EU. But it is precisely the regions bordering third countries that need a functioning instrument for cross-border cooperation. The regulation pretends that this is indeed the case. But it is not. The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, even though Parliament has long demanded it. In practical terms, this means that for the foreseeable future, these regions will be degraded once again to a degenerate form of peripheral zone funding. Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries since 1996 in order to alleviate the difficulties. Nothing has happened! The difficulties are being dragged out again, at the expense of the affected regions. Parliament is once again calling for improvements and cross-border cooperation, and we expect a common fund to be established and the regulation to be amended again in cooperation with the other Commissioners.	de
Mr. President, the Council's approval of the draft Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union is approaching. The prevailing view is that it is about time. According to the action plan for combating organized crime, adopted by the Council in April 1997, work on the Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters should have been completed before the end of 1997. Even more time will have to pass before the Convention enters into force, as it must be ratified by the Member States. Despite the new rules introduced by the Amsterdam Treaty, which provide for the entry into force of the Convention as soon as it has been approved by at least half of the Member States, I would like to urge the Member States to spare no effort to accelerate its ratification. The experience of previous ratifications of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is regrettably disappointing. This Convention will not create a new or different system of mutual assistance. On the contrary, its objective is to improve the tried and tested mechanisms that have long been in place, such as those provided for in the 1959 Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance and the Benelux Treaty. The draft prepared by the Council contains provisions on a number of issues that have been debated by several Members. One of the notable achievements of the Convention is that, to the extent possible, Member States receiving requests for assistance must follow the formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting Member States. This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence obtained in court. Furthermore, requests can be made directly between competent authorities, without having to go through the central administration. Broadly speaking, there are two types of provisions: those establishing an obligation to provide assistance, such as provisions on telephone and videoconferences, controlled deliveries, and the interception of telecommunications; and those that do not establish such an obligation and merely provide a legal framework for Member States that wish to cooperate in the prescribed manner, for example, the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert investigations, and the forwarding and service of procedural documents. The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions relating to new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in combating the type of crime most likely to profit from open borders: organized crime. It is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations. However, we must not forget one aspect common to all action relating to criminal proceedings: the right to a defense. I greatly appreciate that Mr. Di Pietro's report, whom I congratulate on the excellent work he has accomplished in such a short time, includes the right to a defense as one of its main points. Currently, Member States are solely responsible for ensuring respect for this right, subject to the control of the Council of Europe Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.	es
This criticism is not new. Ever since Europe began trying to do something about development cooperation, the effectiveness and quality of this assistance have been called into question. Hope for improvement is threatened with extinction if the Commission continues to refuse to look at itself in the mirror. Why was the critical report on the coherence of development cooperation policy not circulated externally? One of the key findings of that report concerned the internal contradictions in European policy. Particularly in the areas of agriculture and trade, European policy is in contradiction with development cooperation policy. We are failing to provide serious development aid to the least developed countries. This is due to the divergent views of different EU countries regarding development cooperation. We must no longer regard development cooperation as an instrument under Foreign Affairs or External Relations, but rather as an independent policy area. I advocate a transparent, supportive, and effective development cooperation policy. As long as the European approach to the issue of development cooperation remains a source of inefficiency and waste of money, it is preferable for this role to be devolved to the Member States. Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to forward to Parliament as soon as possible the document I mentioned, so that we can reflect positively on the solutions that could be found. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this initiative is a relevant and entirely sensible one. As many colleagues have already said before me, we often find highly contradictory situations between what we claim to do with development and cooperation policy, on the one hand, and what we undo, on the other, with other sectoral policies whose interests are contrary in terms of the development of these same countries. We are not only talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and industry. We generally talk, more seriously, about contradictions between our economic and trade policies, on the one hand, and our defense policies, on the other. Finally, there is a set of contradictory situations. In my opinion, the contradictions are not so serious in terms of Community policies; they are more serious with regard to certain objectives and certain industries of some Member States. We must be aware of this. On the one hand, we often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world, as we did very recently in the case of Indonesia, a case that should raise the cogs to the heavens, and then we find, on the other hand, that certain European countries were supplying that country with arms and war material. These are, in my opinion, the most serious contradictions in this area, more serious than the contradictions of a certain incompatibility of sectoral policies, which of course exists. It is obvious that there are always contradictions between different policies, even in a given country. This is normal. At the European Union level, we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various common policies, in this case in development policy. We must be aware that these contradictions exist and that they must be minimised. This objective of minimising contradictions is a just and wise objective, and the basis for the presentation of this resolution.	fr
"Similarly, with regard to judicial and criminal matters, which we have discussed today, I believe that not only should we coordinate the different criminal, judicial and administrative legislative systems, but that we also need to finally formulate common rules: what is a crime in Italy must also be a crime in Great Britain, Spain and so on. I believe that we, the Parliament of the European Union, representatives elected by the citizens, must give the greatest impetus to achieve a European Union that provides for the regulation of all areas of citizens' lives, including that of justice, as well as that of pensions. We will vote against this report; in fact, by allowing the cross-border interception of telecommunications and reversing the burden of proof, the Convention will provide a favourable legal framework for large-scale electronic espionage operations in the EU. This means making an electronic espionage system such as the American operation ECHELON perfectly legal in Europe too. This Convention will be the source of serious abuses against individual rights to privacy. This is a terrible threat to civil liberties in the European Union. We also find the following unacceptable: joint investigation teams, controlled deliveries, covert operations, vagueness in the text on the scope of the Convention, failure to respect the principle of proportionality and lack of democratic guarantees. Resolution on the Commission's strategic objectives 2000-2005 Commission President Prodi said that 'the responsibility for Africa lies with us' and not, it seems, with the United States or any other large country. I worked in Africa 30 years ago; it was then a poor and underdeveloped continent, but its problems have since become catastrophically worse. Last year, two million people died of AIDS in Africa, while around 200,000 died in war. In Zambia, 25 percent of teachers died of AIDS. In some countries, children had better prospects in basic education and healthcare 20 years ago than they do today. Our policies for Africa lack coherence: there is an uncontrolled overlapping of initiatives, and above all the debt burden still blocks the road to real development. It is clear that Africa is now a forgotten continent. In its communication on the strategic objectives 2000-2005, the Commission reiterates the need to make Europe a ""global player"" that makes its voice heard in the world. What should be the objective of this global player? The citizen probably expects a response that includes better defense of European countries, this being the essential and traditional mission of the political association. Well, such an answer does not appear anywhere. At most, one finds generic phrases about ""strategic partnerships"" and the new opportunities for developing trade that would apparently result from the complete integration of Europe. The fact that the main objective is omitted is a very indicative fact that highlights one of the serious shortcomings of the European Union - a little-known shortcoming, almost always implicit, but which explains in large part the disaffection of citizens. In the work programme for the year 2000, annexed to the strategic guidelines, there is a very significant passage in this regard."	it
During this visit, as requested by honourable Members and others, I will inaugurate the European representation in FYROM. The deadline for the conclusion of the negotiations is December this year, but everything will depend to a large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators. The agreement could enter into force within three or four years, taking into account the time needed for ratification in the parliaments of the Member States. I would like to make a few brief comments on several points in the draft resolution. We recognise that the agreement must to some extent serve as an example for other such agreements, although we will take into account that we are dealing with different countries, each of which has its own identity and interests. I share the very widespread concern that each country should be treated on its own merits and not forced to follow the pace of the slowest in developing relations with the Union. That was never the intention. The very fact that negotiations are starting with FYROM, before all the others, proves that we can and do make the necessary distinctions. On the regional aid referred to in the report, we agree that technical and financial assistance should be partly earmarked for projects with a cross-border or regional dimension and that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of accession to the European Union contained in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, as this will reflect the position of the European Union on its relations with the Western Balkan countries as set out in the conclusions of the Cologne European Council. We strongly support the need to decentralise assistance programmes as much as possible. As regards the provisions on EU assistance to the Western Balkans, Members will be aware that we are drafting a new regulation to simplify and streamline its management and to bring it all together in one regulation. I am aware of the concern that the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and, above all, the loss of association with the name PHARE will cause in FYROM and elsewhere. I have noted with concern what Members have said in this regard. I will return to this issue, although it is worth pointing out that having two PHARE programmes running risks creating real confusion. I would like to stress, however, that whatever we call the programme, our commitment to the integration of FYROM and neighbouring countries into the European family is stronger than ever. In general, I trust that Members will share my satisfaction in seeing Macedonia reach this stage in a relatively short time. I hope that other countries in the region will step up their efforts to make similar progress. I look forward to more debates like this in the coming years, hopefully marking the success of what we are trying to do in the Balkans, which in my view remains the most important test of what Europe can do on its doorstep. Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00.	it
"Mr. President, I have had the privilege of listening to the Commissioner speak on this matter on several occasions, and I fully agree with his approach. However, I would like to ask you something different. We just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is very interested in improving communication with the public and focusing the Commission's information policy on the main issues the Community will address this year. Would the Commissioner be prepared to advocate allocating part of the Commission's information budget to inform and consult citizens on this issue of the Citizens' Charter? It is very important that the public feel involved in this process. I know that the Convention will have a major impact in this regard, but it does not have the resources available to the Commission. Will the Commission consider using its information budget to ensure public participation in this debate? The Commission's policy is to encourage an open and broad debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organizations but also with citizens, especially in the case of a project with such far-reaching implications as this Charter. I can assure you that the Commission will do everything possible to encourage debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights. The best way to achieve this is to have a clear text, one that citizens can easily read, and at the same time, a text that serves as a legal instrument. The two are not incompatible at all. The challenge we face is to combine both concepts in the final version of the Charter. I am very pleased to know that I can count on your support in this regard. Question No. 40 by (H-0095/00): Subject: Article 6(1) and Article 7(1) and (2) of the Treaty on European Union. Article 6(1) of the TEU stipulates that the Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is clear, as can be seen from statements made over recent years, that Jörg Haider and the Austrian Liberal Party do not respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of third-country nationals and minorities residing in Austria. Therefore, can the Commission indicate when it intends to find, pursuant to Article 7(1), ""a serious and persistent violation by a Member State of principles referred to in Article 6(1)"" and to call on the Council, acting by a qualified majority, to suspend certain rights arising from the application of the Treaty to Austria, in particular the voting rights of Austria's representative on the Council? Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by recalling the position adopted by the Commission—and reiterated again this morning by President Romano Prodi—regarding the composition of the new Austrian Government, which includes ministers from Jörg Haider's Austrian Liberal Party. I am referring, of course, to the declaration issued by the Commission on 1 February 2000, the essential outlines of which I will begin by recalling."	es
In my opinion, it is important that the Community initiative can be launched promptly and that the report receives the approval of a large majority, so that the Commission too can be persuaded to take account of the constructive proposals of the European Parliament. It should be remembered that Parliament has placed the EQUAL funds in the reserve, so that the opinions of Members can also be reflected in this Community initiative. The European Parliament is therefore justified in insisting that any change in priorities should only be possible if Parliament is consulted again. I am firmly determined to make the EQUAL initiative worthy of the name. It should ensure equal opportunities for all disadvantaged people in the European Union and prevent social disintegration. It should also prevent exclusion from continuing to be an everyday reality. Finally, it should offer everyone the opportunity to benefit from a Community initiative, regardless of age, sex or origin. That is what I intend to do and I therefore call on the House to give the report a convincing approval! Madam President, the mere fact of having a debate today on the new Community initiative URBAN is in itself a considerable success, and it is no small achievement that your rapporteur is here tonight, given that Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m., but I did it anyway! A year ago, when the Commission presented its proposals for AGENDA 2000, it cut the URBAN initiative. However, we politicians knew that there was a growing tide of support for the continuation of this initiative in 2000. Parliament can therefore take credit for the successful campaign for URBAN and for convincing the Commission and the Council to reconsider. Urban policy has always been at the forefront of Community policies. In my own Member State, for example, we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and a government taskforce on urban areas has been appointed to follow up on the problems of urban communities. With eight out of ten Europeans living in urban areas, it is legitimate to help our most disadvantaged communities to address familiar problems such as poverty, social exclusion, unemployment, crime, drug addiction and all the related issues. For example, in my own region of Manchester, the URBAN Community Initiative has been a huge success. URBAN money has been invested in one of the UK's most deprived neighbourhoods, Moss Side. The Millennium Youth Park project is trying to re-engage young people in activities that will revitalise their communities, and with support for small businesses and social policy, we are starting to see a real revival in a previously deprived urban community. The work done under this URBAN programme has been disseminated to the wider community through communications and information campaigns in local supermarkets and well-known British pubs. We would like to see these examples of good practice spread across the Union through information and awareness-raising campaigns. The specific guidelines of the initiative are essentially intended to promote local and regional diversity.	it
These services are also a strong and not negligible element of civic ties. Indeed, as has been repeatedly pointed out, is not the postman the last contact in territorial areas that are defined as depopulated or disintegrated, whether they are isolated geographical areas or the at-risk suburbs of our cities? I cite as an example the initiative of the French postal service, which has undertaken to ensure the presence of interpreters and public scribes in post offices in degraded urban areas. Without considering jobs in related industries, the European public postal service currently employs one and a half million people, who are put at risk by the spectre of a brutal and uncontrolled liberalisation. The European Parliament is proud to have succeeded in reconciling openness to competition with the constraints of a universal service that respects employment needs. We are pleased, but we want all this to continue. For this reason, we can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is currently kept on the sidelines of the decision-making process that governs the fate of the postal sector in Europe. It is regrettable that to date - as is emphasised in the resolution - the Commission has not taken into account the resolution of 14 January 1999 which required, we recall, that the European Parliament be involved in the preparation of the measures envisaged and that the reliability of the impact studies on liberalisation be increased. These studies are necessary to assess the effects of any type of uncontrolled liberalisation not only from the point of view of the economic organisation of the market, but also with regard to the human and social dimension. The delays accumulated by the Commission are having an impact on the proposed timetable and the date of 2003 must absolutely be reconsidered. By defining a sector reserved for public postal operators, on the basis of weight and price limits, the Postal Services Directive allowed for gradual and controlled liberalisation. The drastic reduction of these limits calls into question the balance between public service obligations and the economic viability of postal services. In a context of globalisation, in which the logic of profitability and profit is increasingly opposed to concerns about territorial balance and social cohesion, it is essential to remember our attachment to the European public service, be it postal today, railway tomorrow, health care the day after. Mr President, I rise to protest, like other MEPs representing Scotland, against anything that would diminish the quality of life in the most remote rural areas. Postal services and post offices are a vital element for rural communities throughout Europe and, in particular, in Scotland. It would be a disaster if, intentionally or not, actions were to be taken that would damage them. I do not believe that anyone intends to do so, just as I do not believe that the Commission has decided to declare war on the islands of Scotland or Greece. However, the Commission could unwittingly cause very serious damage to these communities. The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of postal services should take place.	it
A social, economic, and cultural phenomenon, tourism concerns the majority of European citizens, whether as beneficiaries or as providers of a wide variety of services. Every year, nearly 200 million Europeans leave their usual place of residence for a period of time to go on holiday, most often in other European countries. Moreover, Europe remains the main tourist destination for third countries, even though it faces increasingly strong competition and an increasingly diverse and attractive offering. Since the Treaties do not provide a specific legal basis for the implementation of a genuine Community tourism policy, the European Union must contribute to improving and encouraging cooperation in this sector, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity, in order to realize the potential that tourism offers in terms of employment. Vocational training and labour mobility are essential tools in a strategy to combat unemployment in Europe, particularly for tourism service providers, in order to meet the multicultural demands of demand and ensure appropriate customer service. Employment in tourism is often highly seasonal and precarious, which is an obstacle to its sustainable development. It is therefore all the more urgent to acquire and disseminate management and technological know-how in order to encourage new production methods and promote a tourism offering that best meets market trends. The adoption by Member States of tax measures favourable to SMEs in order to reduce, in particular, the burden on the labour factor would be, as the report indicates, an excellent way of encouraging employment growth in labour-intensive sectors and, consequently, in the tourism sector. This area of activity is also a decisive element in the economic and social development of the least favoured regions: I am thinking in particular of the outermost and island regions, whose strengths in this area are undeniable. Let us not forget that, in these outermost regions, tourism represents the leading industry in terms of revenue. The revenue and employment generated by tourism contribute significantly to reducing imbalances and encouraging convergence of their economies towards the average rate of Community development. Furthermore, tourism can foster a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it allows for greater awareness of the different European cultures and thus contributes to developing respect for European ways of life. It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed wisely, in the long term, must represent a sustainable source of income for local economies while safeguarding and enhancing the rich landscape, culture, history and environment. Finally, I would like to stress the vital role that the European Union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places: I am thinking specifically and particularly of introducing Europeans, continental Europeans, to the most remote European destinations, the outermost regions. Mr President, we have launched a major debate on very little because, ultimately, the basic document is nothing more than a Commission communication following the conclusions and recommendations of a high-level group on tourism and employment. Not only is it about very little, but the document we are talking about is also rather old, given that it is dated 28 April 1999, that is to say almost a year ago.	fr
I therefore appeal to those ministers not to undermine this agreement, which was reached with great difficulty. I would like to call on the Commission - and I am pleased that Commissioner Solbes is here this evening - to present us promptly with this multiannual financing programme, with the related report, as requested by Parliament, so that it can be taken into account in the preparation of the preliminary draft of the next budget, in line with what we have been promised. Finally, I would like to point out that, although we have just agreed on EUR 35 million, we know that this is an insufficient palliative; we must reach agreement as soon as possible on a multiannual programme for the necessary reconstruction of Kosovo. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for the delay, which is due to the other issue which unfortunately also appears on today's agenda again. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy recommends releasing the EUR 35 million because the money can really be used to benefit the people affected. Although the grounds for criticism - essentially the lack of willingness to help the people of Kosovo - are not very serious, we will continue to be critical. The procedure would certainly be much further along if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to send us the documentation through official channels, thus preventing us from opening an in-depth debate on the matter. I call on the administration to take the necessary measures to avoid similar omissions in the future. We are refusing to draw the necessary conclusions from what has happened just because we have the interests of the affected populations at heart. Before releasing the funds, however, it is essential to set some conditions. The first is that the money must be allocated to reasonable initiatives and not to those who could use it for other purposes. In other words, the money must really be allocated to the areas for which Mr Kouchner is responsible and not to others. Even if the Commission and the Council have taken a different position because of the difficulties in implementing our proposal, we also believe that the other donors must honour their commitments. This is a UN-led mission and it is not acceptable that only the European Union is fulfilling its commitments! In the interests of the victims, other donor countries must also honour their promises within the timeframe provided. This leads me to argue that this issue needs to be addressed much more thoroughly, not only in relation to this specific project, but in relation to all development aid in South-Eastern Europe. They show that the European Union is willing to help by providing funds, but that there is a lack of unity in political leadership. We have so many coordinators reporting to so many superiors that we will soon be called upon to appoint a coordinator of coordinators. Perhaps a more constructive meeting between the competent authorities of the European Union and other institutions, from the OSCE to the United Nations, could be needed to consider and establish a new, single and coordinated procedure for providing effective aid to local populations.	it
I would like to ask what new initiatives the Council can take to safeguard the interests of these farmers in the upcoming world trade negotiations, particularly in the face of large-scale, industrial-style production in the United States and New Zealand, where economies of scale make it extremely difficult for European family farms to remain competitive and where, of course, European food safety standards do not apply. I fully understand the Member's concerns and I can see that we need to make an effort and achieve a certain consistency, including within the European Union, on this issue. We also need to consider the consequences, particularly in terms of financing and compensation for farmers. However, as you know, this issue is a matter for the European Commission, which will have to develop it. The Council has a limited capacity to intervene in this matter. Mr President, allow me, in turn, to welcome the presence of the President-in-Office in this chamber. However, I do not think he answered my question, which specifically concerns addressing the problem of homelessness and housing. I also asked whether the Portuguese Presidency planned to meet with the non-governmental organizations actively engaged in this area. I appreciate and fully endorse his comments on the need for multiple policies and a multidisciplinary approach, as well as the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion, which can lead to homelessness, not to mention drug addiction. My question relates specifically to homelessness. It is whether a new Presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties to which the President-in-Office referred in relation to aid at the intergovernmental level. I feel that Europe can play a very active role in this regard, if only by serving as a forum where Member States can exchange experiences and the practices that seem to work best. Mr. Deputy Speaker, regarding the possibility of the Presidency supporting the actions of non-governmental organizations, particularly in the specific case of combating homelessness, I would like to say that this type of initiative is welcome, and we are more than open to any possibility of supporting them. We have collaborated with Portuguese non-governmental organizations and with some of their initiatives presented as part of the Portuguese Presidency's action, which we link to all the concerns underlying our own program. We do not have any specific concrete initiative in this area, so we are not closed to the possibility of an initiative by non-governmental organizations being proposed to us in this area during our Presidency. This initiative must fall within the Council's capacity for action. However, it must be understood that anything that could affect the Commission's right of initiative will, of course, have to go through the Commission itself. Mr President-in-Office, you have spoken to us a lot about the future: what the Commission will do, what the Presidency will do in Lisbon, etc. And you have made an announcement that terrifies me, Mr President.	fr
What is absolutely necessary is a minimum of certain rules, valid within the Community, with an obvious increase in guarantees to the maximum levels, also to protect ourselves in view of enlargement. I think about what this Community, these conventions or judicial relations could be if, for example, a fascist country like Turkey were to join the European Union: I would be truly perplexed. It is necessary to have a corpus juris - and everyone has said so - and common rules, especially procedural ones, which guarantee a common rule of law throughout the Community. It is obvious that this is mainly a matter for the IGC and that it is an aspiration to which Parliament can contribute only in a limited way since everything depends on the Council and the Commission. I believe that this first half of the year, in which the Commissioner is Portuguese and the Presidency is held by Portugal, is an excellent opportunity to give an initial boost to this common aspiration. This is precisely why we are in favour of amendments Nos. 78 and 79, which already prefigure a minimum of certain rules on wiretapping and videoconferencing. On the one hand, we are awaiting the outcome of this vote with great attention, precisely to avoid a total emptying of this convention - which, I repeat, already establishes minimum rules - and, on the other, we are also in favour of waiting for any proposal that comes from the Commission so that this minimum Community right is finally implemented. Mr President, faced with the growing phenomena of organised crime at an international level, the Member States should undoubtedly collaborate with each other as much as possible; indeed, the institutional conditions should be created to start a concrete and effective process of cooperation in the judicial field: a process that must, however, face all the necessary stages to avoid inappropriate forcing to the detriment of legitimate national indications in matters of justice, over which the Member States are sovereign, and above all to avoid forcing that ends up trampling on the fundamental rights of citizens. We must therefore proceed with caution when faced with a document such as that of the Council where, as the rapporteur also underlined, after years of discussion, it is now claimed that everything can be resolved in just a few months. Furthermore - and I agree with the assessments of the Honourable Di Pietro - the Council text appears to be far too full of contradictions, inconsistent formulations and gaps. And justice, more than other sectors, obviously cannot be treated in an inconsistent and contradictory way. In the opinion of our group, the report as a whole also appears to be very questionable, despite the introduction of some corrective amendments, sensitive to the protection of personal freedoms and respect for national sovereignty. The report deals with disciplines that are too heterogeneous, there is no graduality and it proceeds by approximation. In conclusion, we will vote against this report, reiterating that the Europe we hope for must be a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that require gradual and responsible reflection, as well as very serious in-depth analysis. First, general rules and institutional certainties must be established, and only then can we proceed to the establishment of practical conventions.	it
Finally, I would like to address the issue of liability. Not only in terms of the maximum amounts, which I believe must be similar to those in North America. We have set $180 million; in the US, they talk about $1 billion as the upper limit for compensation. I believe we need to increase the current amount and approach a level similar to that in the US, but also reconsider the level of insurance and thus the liability of shipowners, including those who charter the ships, the owners of the cargo, in this liability. As long as the responsibility of the cargo owners is not demanded, I believe the problems will not be definitively resolved. I'll conclude; I don't want to go into this in any more detail. We'll have an opportunity to do so another time. However, as one speaker said—and I thank everyone for their absolutely constructive and pertinent contributions—we must not allow ourselves to be saying in one, two, or three years' time that we didn't do what we should have done. For my part, after discussing this in the College of Commissioners, I can say that the Commission is ready to present to Parliament and the Council the legislative measures, amendments, and directives necessary to provide us with the highest possible safety standards. What is required is the political will of this Parliament – and I note that I can count on it – as well as that of the Council of Ministers. Thank you very much, Commissioner. We have noted your willingness. I have received, pursuant to Rule 37(2), eight motions for resolutions to conclude this Commission statement. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12:00 noon. Storms in Europe. The next item is the Commission statement on storms in Europe. Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission. Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your words, especially for the very concrete proposals for the victims, who expect a great deal from the European Union and our help. Personally, just a few days after that terrible storm, I wrote to you asking the French authorities to adjust the Objective 2 areas so that all storm-damaged regions, both in France and in other countries, would be eligible for Objective 2 aid. I believe this has been done, since you haven't said anything about it. We all know that if you don't meet the Objective 2 criteria, it's extremely difficult to get aid. It's better to address this problem immediately. You also know that this isn't just a short-term problem, but a medium- and long-term one as well. Let me explain. I was just in Lorraine when that terrible storm destroyed about 20% of the deciduous forest there. A 20% loss represents an enormous loss for some forestry communities. We know, for example, that a tree takes 150 to 200 years to reach full maturity. The loss for these communities will therefore not be spread over one, two, or five years, but over a much longer period.	de
"However, close attention must be paid to its viability. This requires taking into account natural base emissions that cannot be influenced, as well as diffuse emissions, which are difficult to control, and which also substantially pollute water. Mr. President, in the 21st century, we must accept the fundamental notion that our relationship with water has completely changed. In the 20th century, the aquatic environment was for us a free dumping and disposal system for poisons, special waste, chemicals, etc. The consequences are already visible! We must change this way of thinking and recognize that water is one of the most important elements for our lives, and our responsibility in this regard extends far beyond our current generations. The directive must also be explained in this context, and the public must be able to clearly understand what we intend to do in this area and what the Commission intends to do. Water protection is also, at its core, a social issue, and a decisive social issue. For this reason, it is necessary to strengthen the application of the ""polluter pays"" principle, otherwise everyone will have to bear the consequences. In view of the progressive deterioration of water resources, it is important that we do not limit ourselves to preserving their current state, but that in tomorrow's vote we strive to ensure a real qualitative improvement. Mr. President, some six years have passed since our colleague Karl-Heinz Florenz, supported by Ursula Schleicher, called for a reorganization of the entire water policy. This has already been done. This is not an easy matter, and I think that the effort made by Mrs. Lienemann deserves our full respect. The decision-making process surrounding this water framework directive is at a very important stage. The issue was raised under the codecision procedure, and at the first reading, we were already able to adopt important and more tailored legislation. The Community position put forward at the end of last year already represented a significant improvement over the original proposal. It is very difficult to adopt policies in this area because the differences are so vast. I would like to say the following to my Spanish colleague: in northern Europe, we have often had to fight flooding, and also water pollution caused by industry, while the problem for our colleagues in southern Europe is often that water has to be transported over long distances simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture. Let me elaborate on two elements of this proposal. First, quality. The Netherlands is greatly influenced by European water policy. A very significant proportion, one-third of the drinking water we consume, is extracted in the Netherlands from surface water. The Netherlands is located downstream, in a delta, and therefore the quality of the surface water we receive is of the utmost importance. Another important point of discussion is the establishment of water quality standards. A number of amendments have raised questions about the proposed standards, particularly the OSPAR standard for 2020."	es
The new element in the URBAN II initiative is that it was designed for small towns and urban neighborhoods. This is important, because small towns and cities often have the least chance of obtaining funding. On the other hand, however, it is precisely in such towns that the problems that make renovation necessary are particularly concentrated and have a strong negative impact. In order to increase the effectiveness of the individual measures, the number of URBAN II projects has been limited to 50. I believe it is important that this arbitrarily imposed numerical limitation not be rigidly maintained, but that it be left to the Member States to decide how many projects they wish to distribute their funding resources to. However, it is necessary to ensure that, specifically in small Member States, it is not only the neighborhoods of large cities that once again benefit from this aid. In those countries, URBAN II would be nothing more than a drop in the bucket; it would be of dubious success and would fizzle out. Likewise, in my opinion, it is important that the selection criteria for URBAN II not be excessively broadened, and consequently not distorted. A rigorously defined set of criteria is precisely the prerequisite for the projects being supported to achieve model status and be transferable in the future to other cities with problems. Finally, based on my own experience in municipal politics in a region that has been industrialized for many years and is plagued by many problems, I would like to ask you, dear colleagues, to specifically support two points of the report that I consider essential alongside the sociopolitical aspects. First, environmental protection is an essential aspect of sustainable urban development and, consequently, should be a general requirement for project funding. Second, the prevention and fight against common crime and drug-related crime in cities must be included at the local level. These are essential for improving the quality of life in cities and, consequently, must also play a central role in the URBAN II initiative. Mr. President, distinguished rapporteurs, esteemed listeners, I congratulate the rapporteurs, who have produced well-documented reports in a short period of time. However, within my group, the timing of the work carried out by the parliamentary committee has been criticized. The reports are arriving late, and, moreover, their processing has been rushed, at least in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. We have therefore missed a good opportunity to discuss the results of previous programs, their shortcomings, and appropriate implementation methods. Within the scope of the INTERREG program, my group emphasizes cross-border activities and, in particular, cooperation with territories beyond the borders of the Union. Important regions include the Balkans and the Adriatic, but I think we should not forget the cooperation we pursue with Russia either. My group wants to once again highlight the need for better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA, and PHARE programmes, among others.	es
The Court indicates that these problems are emerging now and points to measures that can be taken now to alleviate the problem. However, as Mr. Marinho pointed out, we need more, but that must wait until the IGC. In my own country, the mythology speaks of the teeming hordes of faceless bureaucrats in Brussels, but there is never any mention of the number of European judges. There are fewer than three dozen at the head of the European judiciary—far from excessive, given the responsibilities associated with their tasks at the heart of the European legal system. Their great importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the pending dispute between France and Great Britain over British beef, which has caused so much anger in my country and so much frustration with the functioning of the Union's dispute resolution procedures. This situation has been made worse, some of my advisers believe, by the French Code of Procedure, which makes it virtually impossible for non-French nationals to take legal action against the French Government. It is certainly perceived de facto as impossible. This situation stands in very unfavourable contrast to the British courts, where Spanish fishermen have successfully taken the British Government to court in very similar circumstances. Mr President, what is happening in France appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality, and therefore appears to constitute a breach of the Treaties. I would therefore ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to comment on my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and report his findings to Parliament and to me. I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm, in his final statement, that this will be so. Mr President, on behalf of the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, I would like to make the following reply. The Commission notes the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request from the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, which seeks, on the one hand, to entrust the Court with the examination of certain actions which currently fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court and, on the other, to increase the number of members of the Court. On behalf of the Commission, allow me to add that I have listened with great interest to the arguments which have just been put forward in this Chamber and that I fully understand the underlying concern. The concern is legitimate. It has also been said that justice delayed is justice denied. The Commission understands these considerations. Understanding them, I would like to continue my reply as follows. As your Parliament knows, the Commission is convinced that, without in-depth reform, the Community legal bodies run the risk of no longer being able, in the short term, to fulfil their mission within a reasonable time.	fr
President Arafat will meet the Council of Ministers next week. This will be an excellent opportunity to address the need for bold action to improve Palestinian governance and strengthen the rule of law. The Commission is actively involved in these efforts. The Commission has also increased its support for Israeli-Arab regional cooperation projects. Last year we committed over €20 million to these projects. The package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet at expert and non-governmental body level. Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to global efforts to reconcile the people of the Middle East. A number of issues naturally emerge as potential additional targets for EU support in the next phase of the peace process - including helping to consolidate a settlement in the Golan by contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the reconstruction of communities in the Golan Heights. Syria's economic development will require assistance in the transition from a war economy to a peace economy. Reconstruction and rehabilitation in southern Lebanon, the only area in the Middle East with an ongoing military conflict, will also require significant efforts. We must also continue to provide support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole. We must find a solution to the problem of Palestinian refugees, who constitute the largest refugee group in the world, numbering nearly 5 million, a figure indicative of the daunting challenges that lie ahead. We must support initiatives to increase the availability and improve the distribution and management of the region's very limited water resources. Last but perhaps most importantly, we must encourage closer regional cooperation in a variety of areas, bringing together all the countries concerned in a joint effort to address their common problems. It is already clear that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the level of support that will be needed in the event of permanent peace. I want to underline this point. I would like to remind the Council and, if necessary, Parliament, quite emphatically that we must not continue to allow a gap to open up between our rhetoric and what we can actually do. I repeat that a change in Middle East policy will require a shift in the support that we will be called upon to provide and will be expected of us. I hope I can add that we will want to provide it. We have made progress in recent weeks and months, as Minister Gama said earlier, but it is inevitable that this will be a tough process fraught with difficulties and disappointments. We will do everything we can to bring this process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will come with it. Finally, I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes what I said at the beginning of my remarks: I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate, mainly because I had planned the debate this morning and I have scheduled a meeting on the Balkans for this evening.	it
Thirdly, the Military Staff will represent the senior military officers of the fifteen states who, with me, will form the Civil and Military Secretariat, whose task will be to prepare, with the assistance of the Military Committee, any crisis management operation that may need to be launched in due course within the European Union. This crisis management will not be strictly a military operation; rather, these military officers, the Military Committee, will also be responsible for advising on logistics for any humanitarian operations where the involvement of armed forces may be necessary. Today, Mozambique is certainly an excellent example of how, from a military-logistical perspective, intervention may be necessary not for military but for purely humanitarian purposes. We are working hard, and if I had told you a few months ago, when I had the pleasure of speaking before you for the first time, that on 1 March 2000 I would be announcing that on that very day the Political and Security Committee had met for the first time, that in a week the Military Committee would be functioning, and that the next day the first members of the Military Staff would be moving into the building we have in the European Union, many of you would no doubt have thought the High Representative had lost his mind. We have not lost his mind; we have simply worked hard, intensively, and determinedly, and we have undoubtedly had the help and support not only of you but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries you represent. Few initiatives in the European Union have been carried forward with as much determination, momentum, and commitment as has been the case in crisis management since Helsinki up to the present day. In less than two months, in cooperation with the Commission, we have set a mechanism in motion. I would like to thank Commissioner Patten, who is here with us, for his support and the tremendous energy he too has expended in bringing all these issues to the most successful conclusion possible in a relatively short space of time. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to move on to the second issue I wanted to discuss with you. We have already spoken about the bodies we have set up, but we have a fundamental duty, for the sake of our credibility: that Europe must be able to equip itself with the military capabilities to act in times of crisis management. I would like to reiterate that the European Union's intention with these military capabilities is not to wage war, but to build peace, to participate in crisis management, and to intervene wherever there is war or conflict in order to contain, defuse, and prevent it, in the spirit of the Helsinki Summit, which, as you will recall, wisely decided to create, with the participation of all European states, a force of 60,000 troops capable, when the time comes, of taking up their positions in 60 days – that is, in two months – to prevent a crisis and to continue this action for a year to prevent conflict. It is a large-scale operation, a major objective that we have set ourselves, but I can tell you that we are capable of rising to the challenge set by the Heads of State and Government in Helsinki.	de
Mr President, less than a year has passed and it is already clear how differently this Parliament is approaching the first and second reports. The first report was widely publicised, solemnly debated and used, as were the controversies and press leaks that preceded it, to massacre first the President of the Commission and then the majority of European Commissioners, even though they had nothing to do with fraud, mismanagement and nepotism. Reading now what happened less than a year ago, it is clear that that report was intended to serve anything but to bring about truth or reform, as is claimed today, so much so that this second report, which could have brought much more substantial elements, was commissioned with the specific mandate not to deal with specific cases, since it is not interested in pursuing the illicit acts contained in this report. It does not interest the large groups in this Parliament or the majority of the trade unions, who are verbally committed to defending the European civil service but in reality are busy with the corporate protection of their members, using the broad powers granted to them in a questionable manner. Trade union representatives are on the disciplinary board and the Statute committee so as to make the unfaithful official irremovable and to keep the Statute in check. Trade union representatives are also, incomprehensibly, members of the competition commissions, and I would not be surprised if trade union members were already members of OLAF, causing serious damage to this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee that it is super partes. I therefore understand why we are meeting at this hour, which is usually used for other activities and not for debate, discussion and information. Mr President, with regard to its internal reform, the Commission finds itself in a truly difficult position. After the events that led the old Executive to resign, expectations are enormous. Sometimes I have the feeling that the more radical the proposals put forward, the greater the consensus in the Chamber. On the other hand, the situation cannot be changed overnight with a couple of amendments decided on at the table because the complications arise at the time of implementation, when it comes to defining the details. This is probably the reason why the Committee on Budgetary Control also found it more difficult than expected in addressing the problem, even if it nevertheless reached a noteworthy result: the report presented by my Honourable colleague Van Hulten, whom I expressly thank for the work done. Unless it is made even more lenient by adopting some amendments, the report imposes some clear and unequivocal objectives on the Commission. Allow me to state the first one first: we do not want financial control to be abolished. Even if not in all cases, the controller must be able to continue to carry out preliminary checks on commitment and payment operations where there are risk factors or uncertainty. By renaming the current Directorate-General for Financial Control the Directorate-General for Audit, the Commission is not sending the right signal because, while it is easy to change its organisational chart, things get complicated when it comes to redrafting legal texts, in particular the Financial Regulation.	it
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a staff statute is adopted as soon as possible? In the meantime, can you ensure that Parliament's rules are properly applied and that staff are paid, as they should be, according to the work they do for us? Without them, we would not be able to function. Mr President, I also have a point of order. Are there any rules regulating demonstrations in this Parliament and outside the Chamber, so as to ensure that Members can enter the Chamber unhindered and carry out their obligations? If there are such rules, who is responsible for enforcing them, and how are those responsible for them meeting this task? Mr President, I would like to return to the issue of the assistants' statute, which we have always considered a priority, and inform you that the Italian members of the PSE Group have, at the request of our Group Chairman, Mr Barón Crespo, handed over the contracts we concluded with the assistants to the Quaestors. I consider this a concrete step towards resolving this problem, and I therefore ask the Bureau of Parliament to consider whether it should not encourage all Members to do the same. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to state that I fully support a statute for staff. When I arrived in Parliament yesterday, I was handed a document concerning the proposed demonstration by staff in front of Parliament. As all colleagues know—and many of you have contacted me over the past six months—requests for exhibitions and the like are first referred to Parliament's Comart Committee. To give you a neutral example: for obvious reasons, no commercial exhibitions of any kind are allowed in this Parliament. After receiving a letter yesterday, I immediately suggested to staff that they hold a meeting or demonstration soon, perhaps as early as next month. The holding of such events must under no circumstances interfere with the normal work of Parliament. Yesterday afternoon, during the deliberations of the Bureau of Parliament, I signed a letter informing staff accordingly. As I understand it, you were already informed verbally of this decision last Thursday by the Committee of Group Chairmen. So you were aware of the decision. We are always open to the problems of staff, and there is certainly the possibility of an event of this kind during the next part-session of Parliament. But there must have been a misunderstanding, because you clearly received a letter from someone else which you took as an acceptance. However, all exhibition requests are first examined by the so-called Comart Committee. As you can see, we have a great many exhibitions here in Parliament, whether they are dedicated to different countries or on any other topic. This is by no means an attempt at censorship and in no way contradicts the very realistic and justified demand for a staff statute. Thank you very much, Ms. Banotti. Your comments can certainly help to clarify several of the questions raised here. Mr. President, we are dealing with a problem of fundamental importance here.	de
"Regarding Amendment 15 on the definition of the term ""independent,"" the Commission will, as I noted earlier, seek a satisfactory solution to the objections raised. I would now like to address what Lord Inglewood noted. He referred to the border controls that exist in the United Kingdom, and I would like to tell him that there is no obligation for any Member State, and therefore not for the United Kingdom, to abolish or modify the border controls that still exist. This also applies, as has been said, to the United Kingdom. This also applies to Belgium, where this case recently arose. With regard to Mr. Karas's observation, perhaps I may clarify that I have the impression that he is referring to the possibility of using workers from Poland to work in his country. The Commission would like to propose a solution to this problem, and that this solution would apply to all companies established in the European Union that employ workers from countries outside the EU. The question then is whether the two cases should be considered equally. In my view, it is more a question that is part of the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not of this debate. However, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to make myself available to Mr. Karas should he wish to have further information on this truly important issue. I remain at his disposal. Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the most important aspects of these proposals and, of course, the rapporteur, Ms. Berger. Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. Court of First Instance Mr. President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report which, when read, gives the impression of merely confirming and accepting. However, behind this report lies long and effective work that has already borne some fruit: the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency document of 7 December 1999 of a commitment to broaden the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to the study of future modifications to the organization, composition, and powers of the Community courts. I therefore express my gratitude to the work of Vice-President Marinho. Mr. President, reforming the Community judicial system has become a paramount necessity if, in the future, we are to deliver justice within reasonable timescales, if, in the future, the European Union is to provide itself with a justice system worthy of the political project we have undertaken. Today—I must say this with pride and satisfaction—we have had a good opportunity in this House to demonstrate to what extent we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than the internal market, a project based much more on principles than on economic interests."	es
"Safeguarding the social function of the market is the discriminant between liberalism tout court and a system that serves to improve the quality of life of the person. One aspect to be considered in the new legislation is the economy of the outermost and island regions that must be safeguarded. Therefore, I believe that it would be appropriate to also think about creating two foci of an external market, establishing a profitable relationship with Russia and the Mediterranean countries precisely to make the economies less peripheral. I hope and in this regard I thank Professor Monti that the new legislation will be given the broadest possible slant from the point of view of economic policy and guaranteeing its social function. Mr President, competition represents the strength and the heart of the European single market policy. A free and open market can only exist thanks to competition, delimited by clear and uniform rules of the game. This thought is formulated perfectly in the report by the Honourable Karl von Wogau. But Europe is constantly evolving. The economies are growing, the Union will open up to another 10 or 15 States. If we continue with the current policy, the European Commission will not be able to cope with the workload. Therefore, we need to modernise competition policy. There is no question about that. That said, I still have doubts about the proposed decentralisation. I wonder how the Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, can ensure that competition decisions are made in the same way in London, Palermo, Helsinki and in the future also in Budapest and Ankara. Legal disparities must be avoided and the courts that issue the least severe rulings will be inundated with competition cases. It is not enough to say that the Member States have 40 years of experience. In the Netherlands, the competition authorities are just starting out, as the market is very small and at the same time, unfortunately, is often described as a relevant market. In contrast, in Germany, an experienced Kartellamt exercises its powers in a gigantic market. The European Commission's belief that all countries will almost automatically interpret the legislation in the same way could be described as ""misplaced confidence"", and that is a mistake. We need to work towards uniformity. I am thinking of specialised national courts with the possibility of direct appeal to a special competition chamber within the European Court of Justice. Such a chamber in Luxembourg is essential to gather the necessary experience. Furthermore, the broad economic and social interests associated with these cases do not allow a judgment to be delayed for two years, as is currently the case. What does the Commissioner think? I would like to end my speech with an important comment on small and medium-sized enterprises. In order to give them greater security, the European Commission should draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized enterprises, so that horizontal exemptions are possible in addition to vertical exemptions. By working together, small, independent companies must be able to stand up to large chains, and European competition policy must therefore not aim to make their lives impossible."	it
There is no justification in our society for terrorist actions such as that which cost the lives of the Socialist Speaker of the Basque Parliament and his bodyguard. Moreover, this is a Member of Parliament elected by popular will of Basque society. We hope that these victims will be the last in a process B, as you said, full of barbarity B and that a way can be found to ensure coexistence and peace among the Basque people. B (ES) Madam President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I would like to add my voice to those of my colleagues who are expressing their sorrow at the truly perverse and cruel attack in the Basque Country, who are offering their condolences to the families and are firmly condemning actions that have come from far away and which must be put to an end. One day the terrorist organisation ETA killed some policemen; then it murdered some soldiers; then it exploded a bomb in a supermarket, killing men, women and children; another day, it killed in the streets of Madrid a general commander, Quintana Lacaci, who had defended democracy on February 23; yet another day, it assassinated the spokesperson of the Popular Party in the city hall of San Sebastián, Gregorio Ordóñez; then it was the turn of the university, in the faculty where a professor of constitutional law, Francisco Tomás y Valiente, taught, killed with absolute coldness. A few days ago, after assassinating Lieutenant Colonel Blanco, this organization killed in this infamous manner the socialist deputy Fernando Buesa, spokesperson in the Parliament of Vitoria, and his escort Jorge Díez, a member of the Basque autonomous police. I want to reiterate that those who kill, like the terrorist organization ETA, must be condemned, but those who support and understand such attacks must also be condemned. It is useless to ask these people and these organizations to take the road to democracy from one day to the next. We must appeal to society as a whole, especially to democratic parties, regardless of their national or nationalist dimension, regardless of their pro-European dimension. However, we must also deplore the fact that there are organisations that are silent, people who are silent and others who only lament the deaths as if they were the result of a road accident. All this must be said here very loudly, so that the voice of all European democrats can unite and be heard in the Basque Country, saying that the time has come not to leave, not to separate and not to kill. It is time to share; share the Basque Country, share Spain, share Europe. That is the only way, Madam President. That is why we give you our full support. Madam President, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of the Nations Group, I express our sorrow for the victims and our rebellion against terrorism and against those who protect it. I believe that we are facing a human tragedy, thinking of the families and friends; to a political tragedy, thinking of the political family to which one belongs, but also to a cultural tragedy because the culture of death and violence is increasingly stronger against the culture of respect for others, of democracy and democratic life.	it
I have no doubt about this and believe it is an essential element. In this context, I also wanted to point out that we must be careful what we say. Last week, the new Finance Minister of the Austrian coalition spoke of the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theater. We, who have had to live under dictatorial conditions, know that a dictatorship with a sham parliament can exist. We know there is no democracy without a living parliament. I believe such language is enormously dangerous, and I would like to condemn it from here. Regarding the four major priorities to which President Prodi systematically refers, regarding the analysis of the challenges, I would say that we completely agree with him. But I would like to point out to the Commission that there has been a change in priorities for the Socialist Group. In our view, the top priority is the economic and social policy agenda, which includes what your priorities also call quality of life—that is, the rights of citizens as consumers and also as individuals. These are issues that we repeatedly take for granted but fail to emphasize sufficiently, such as the European social model and its adaptation to new realities, consumer rights and environmental protection, and sustainable development. When we talk about the commitment to full employment, we must begin with the fact that full employment no longer means the same thing today as it did in the Beveridge era at the end of the Second World War, namely work for the male head of the family. We must start with gender equality, with the famous gender mainstreaming, which is one of the topics less addressed in Prodi's program. This presupposes that we give priority to gender equality, the adaptation of the social model, and above all, the clear fight against populism at a time when our economic and social cohesion is under threat. This, too, must be given the highest priority in the Commission's work. And it must be accompanied by a clear fight against racism and intolerance, to provide practical confirmation that the Union has become a magnet for the rest of the world and, because of its prosperity and aging demographics, a hotbed of immigration. This, in my view, must be the main objective we must pursue. Here, I would add another element: economic governance, with a single currency—I believe it will prevail. This, too, is an issue on which the Commission must make progress. Given the ambitious goals, and especially given something important the Commission has done, namely deciding on enlargement in the course of a negotiation and integration process, I would like—and my group would, of course, like—to see more clarity regarding the revision of Agenda 2000. Does the Commission believe there will be no revision until the end? And we also definitely consider burdens a key issue. I think a theoretical reflection on governance in general can be very interesting.	de
My group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council, at the end of last year, gave the green light to a better cooperation strategy and that, moreover, a group of senior officials has already been tasked with presenting an initial report to the Council in June 2000. But we would like, as a Parliament and especially as a Social Democratic group, for Lisbon to take a further step now. It is very important that this European Parliament advocate, through our colleague's report, for a truly European strategy for social convergence, by analogy with what was put in place for employment via the Luxembourg strategy, a strategy, therefore, equipped with Community objectives, guidelines, national action plans and evaluations of benefits. We believe that this approach is ambitious, but nevertheless achievable. It is indeed obvious that the harmonization of social security at European level is not realistic. The systems, in terms of financing and organization, are too diverse for this, and this is also an important reason why social protection is barely making it onto the European agenda. It is also why scenarios such as Dany Peeters' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have barely gotten off the ground. But this new avenue is particularly interesting. The employment strategy has proven that it can work, and social convergence is also necessary because our social security systems face the same challenges and, in the era of EMU, social security systems otherwise threaten to become an element of social competition. But let me make one point clear on behalf of my group: social convergence strategies can in no way be an alternative to social legislation. They can only serve as a very useful complement to what we are putting together and what we expect from the Commission in terms of social legislation. I also think it is a good thing for the European Parliament to try to convince the Council to implement the Community strategy at the Lisbon meeting and to launch, at the beginning of 2001, an annual procedure aimed at reducing the poverty rate. I am pleased that the European Parliament supports this idea from my group and we hope, Commissioner, that we will also have your support. Finally, we insist that the European Parliament and the social partners as well as social NGOs be closely involved in this process. Only a broad and democratic basis can guarantee the success of this strategy and we hope for your support. Mr President, the wording of the four main objectives that the governments of the EU Member States accepted in November of last year and which have been discussed today is so broad that everyone should be able to approve them. Let me remind you of them: there is the idea that all work must be worth doing in order to ensure a guaranteed income, the certainty of being able to provide pensions and the need to make the pension system sustainable, the promotion of social integration and the guarantee of sustainable and high-quality healthcare. On the other hand, we could only benefit intellectually from the creation of a group of high-level officials, which would be the hub for the exchange of experiences in coordinating and evaluating progress made in social and labour market policy.	fr
The Commission has obviously looked at this issue and I am pleased that the reports to date have looked at it so carefully. I would like to stress, however, that the concern about depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used. The uranium in them is released into the air, it is inhaled and therefore it could have much longer-term effects on the people of Kosovo who have breathed it than we have been able to observe so far. This is indeed what is said to have happened after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf War. I would therefore like to ask the Commission whether it is prepared to consider continuing the monitoring checks and for how long it would be prepared to carry out monitoring of the long-term effects not only of depleted uranium weapons but also of other environmental effects which we know have occurred at least locally in Kosovo. How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons? Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your supplementary question. We must reiterate that it is not yet confirmed that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium was found in the clean-up operations in Kosovo. However, the symptoms and problems you are talking about could arise and could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium, the report itself mentions this. No cross-border effects have been detected and the majority of the weapons were used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The problem is that access to the area in question is restricted due to the current political isolation of the country. A great responsibility lies with the United Nations, because they are the recipient of the report and therefore they must assume their responsibility. However, through the environmental and regional clean-up plan we can continue to carry out monitoring actions and provide our assistance and for the time being this is the context in which the Union can operate. It is important to continue to monitor the situation, and among other things, this provides the Member States and also the United Nations and the Commission with food for thought about military secrets and their effects on the environment. In the long term, this also provides food for thought about the use of these types of weapons themselves. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, in a few months' time, hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will once again be heading to the Adriatic beaches for their summer holidays. We know from the media that bombs and weapons have been thrown into the sea close to the coast. Can you assure us that holidaymakers this summer will be able to swim in the Adriatic without danger, and are there any plans to study the threat we are facing in more detail? I would like to be able to guarantee many things, but unfortunately I cannot. We form our judgements on the basis of reports like this and the verification missions we send in cases like this.	it
Let me assure Mr. MacCormick, among other honourable Members, that the current situation, in which excise duties differ between Member States, is truly unconducive to the smooth functioning of the internal market. However, this situation is not limited to alcoholic products. If we look at gasoline, for example, we will see that excise duties in Germany are different from those in the Netherlands, and consequently, Dutch motorists cross the border to fill up their tanks in Germany. This is actually a distortion of the internal market. If it were up to me, I would wave a magic wand and equalize excise duties across Europe. That would eliminate smuggling, unless products are intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than in another. But I don't have a magic wand, and it's not up to me. This is an area where there must be unanimity, as Mr. MacCormick knows, and unless all Member States agree on the harmonization of excise duties, it will never be achieved. Once again, towards the end of this year, the Commission will present a report on the situation with excise duties, and I will obviously be available to debate that report with Parliament. Thank you very much, Commissioner. Today we will heed your advice and try to have a glass—or two, perhaps—of Alsatian wine, which we do not know how taxed, although I assume it is also highly taxed. As the time allocated for Question Time with the Commission has expired, Questions 55 to 114 will be answered in writing. Question Time with the Commission is now closed. (The sitting, adjourned at 7:30 p.m., resumes at 9:00 p.m.) Community policy in the field of water (continued) The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for the second reading on Community policy in the field of water. Mr. President, the situation regarding freshwater in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world, but, generally speaking, it is a well-established fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decline. Added to this are the problems of water pollution affecting the potential new Member States in the east. Incidentally, a cyanide reservoir has just burst in Romania, threatening aquifers that supply the population of Yugoslavia. I understand that Mrs. Wallström, whom I very much thank for her presence this evening, is going to pay a visit to the area. I believe that no country, no government, and certainly no Member of this Parliament can fail to recognize the need for this directive to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a program of specific measures for each river basin. The process has been difficult and complex, the interests at stake are multiple, and opinions are divided. I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this term, Ms. Lienemann, has devoted great effort and dedication to reconciling and reconciling positions, and she has succeeded to a significant extent.	es
Fortunately, I say! As is perhaps well known, the Mediterranean, unlike the cold seas of the North, is a small and warm sea, where it is very difficult, if not impossible, for schools of fish of a certain species to form. Consequently, the idea, put forward in the explanatory statement of the report in question, of establishing TACs in Mare Nostrum is inappropriate in our opinion. Finally, as regards the amendments proposed by the United Left group, we would vote in favour. In fact, we believe it is very important to financially support traditional fishing and artisanal activities, as well as income support for fishermen during the periods in which the so-called biological stop is applied: in essence, to make an important and responsible economic activity compatible with the due respect for the environment. Mr President, first of all I am pleased to see that the Katiforis report takes into consideration the multiplicity of factors responsible for the degradation of the marine environment: pollution, uncontrolled fishing, the presence of extraction platforms, the pressure of human activity on coastal areas are sources of potential environmental damage on a large scale, both in coastal areas and offshore, and fishing is a further victim of this state of affairs. It is therefore right to examine in depth and analyse the interrelations between fishing and the environment. The use of selective gear that reduces by-catches and limits fishing waste is certainly an essential point, as is, on the other hand, the reduction of fishing pressure not only in coastal waters. The reduction of fishing capacity and fishing pressure on fish stocks does not necessarily go hand in hand with maintaining an obsolete fleet and limiting modernisation. More modern vessels, in addition to allowing more adequate safety and hygiene conditions, can also help reduce certain impact factors. Furthermore, it is important to state the concept that it is not possible to classify a whole segment of fishing as more environmentally friendly a priori: in some cases, it is true that small-scale fishing has a lower impact on the environment and its resources. I am also satisfied that the report takes into consideration the possibility of launching an information campaign for fishermen and consumers on the risks arising from the reckless exploitation of fishery resources, just as I am satisfied with the request made to the Commission to propose the establishment of a European prize to be awarded to various categories of the sector and to all those who offer services and advice for responsible behaviour, for the purposes of the sustainable management of fishery stocks and the conservation of nature in the marine environment. Mr President, as not only a member of the Verts/ALE Group, but also as a Member of the Galician Parliament, I would like to make two brief considerations in this speech. Firstly, fishing production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two aspects of the same issue. It is the shipowners and sailors of the countries with the greatest fishing activity who are most interested in respecting their living environment, since without it they cannot guarantee the future of this type of economy.	it
We will work towards this. We will see whether we can reach a consensus on this. Question No 5 by (H-0785/99): Subject: Proposal for a regulation fixing the total allowable catches for certain fish stocks for the year 2000, particularly anchovy. According to recent reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, anchovy stocks in ICES area VIII are currently in a critical state. Have the Council of Ministers responsible for Fisheries and the Commission considered the impact on the anchovy stocks in ICES area VIII of the transfer of the quota for ICES areas IX and X and CECAF area 34.1.1 from Portugal to France (overfishing of 5 000 tonnes per year) and considered their responsibility for the current state of these stocks and the foreseeable economic and social consequences for this fishing sector? Given the clearly precarious situation of these stocks, does the Council consider it acceptable to create a permanent basis for such overfishing and for exceeding the total allowable catch (TAC) originally set at 33 000 tonnes per year? What measures will the Council take, and when, to take account both of the critical state of anchovy stocks, of the quota transfer referred to, and of the principle of relative stability of fishing activities? Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency has a strong interest in obtaining a full answer to this question, not least because it relates to an issue that, in a positive sense, concerns Portugal, and I will explain why in a moment. The Council is aware of the critical situation of the anchovy stocks in the Cantabrian Sea, to which the honourable Member referred. At the last Council of Fisheries Ministers on 16 and 17 December last year, the Member States operating this fishery, namely France, Spain, and Portugal, considered that the application of the precautionary principle, which, on a Commission proposal, reduced the total allowable catch from 5,000 tonnes to 2,000 tonnes, had been too cautious. In order to strike a balance between the need to reduce biological risks—that is, the impact on fish species—and the economic and social problems caused by restricting fishing, a compromise was found by setting the total allowable catch at the intermediate level of 16,000 tonnes, instead of the 33,000 tonnes envisaged in 1999. Provision was also made for its review in the light of new scientific information on species conservation, and appropriate data are expected to be available in the first half of this year. For the southern anchovy stock, in ICES area IX, the total allowable catch for the whole of 2000 was set at 10 000 tonnes, compared to 13 000 tonnes in 1999. The exchange of quotas between Portugal and France was reduced proportionally, from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000, to be caught in French waters. I would like to point out that this quota transfer does not increase the pressure on anchovy stocks as a whole, for the entire Community fisheries area. In accordance with the principle of relative stability, the allocation key for anchovy in the Cantabrian Sea allocates 90% of the stock to Spain and only 10% to France.	de
For the time being, that is my opinion. It may be the subject of discussions here and elsewhere. I will listen to any suggestions, but my first conclusion is that this authority should occupy a central rather than a peripheral position. Ladies and gentlemen, I find myself in a very difficult situation because I cannot change the agenda. I would suggest that you discuss this subject within your political groups and raise the issue during the Conference of Presidents. If you consider these sessions following a Commission statement to be important, I would suggest that we request more time than the half hour allocated to them. This time, the questions from Members lasted six minutes, and the replies and the Commissioner's statement lasted 29 minutes. As you can see, half an hour is really not enough time for such sessions. I hope that you will discuss this within your political groups so that we can participate in better-structured sessions with the Commission on future occasions. The debate is closed. Question Time (Committee) The next item is Question Time to the Commission (B5-0003/2000). I would like to inform you that we will be devoting approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time. The allotted time will therefore be slightly shortened because the interpreters are working in a continuous session today. I call Mr Purvis on a point of order. I object to the fact that we are reducing the time for Question Time; it is one of the rare occasions when ordinary Members have the opportunity to speak, and I ask you to extend it to one and a half hours, as stipulated in the agenda. That is the agenda, and I think we should stick to it. Dear colleague, if we stick to the agenda, we should have started at 5:30 p.m., but you see what time it is. In any case, I hope we do not end up in a night session. First part Question No. 28 of (H-0781/99): Subject: Construction of a nuclear power station in a region of Turkey with high seismic activity The two earthquakes, measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, which recently occurred in Turkey give rise to the greatest concern at Turkey's stated intention to build expensive nuclear reactors at Akuyu, at a time when the surplus energy produced by the Ataturk dams is being exported to third countries and the EU is using its own resources to help repair the damage caused by the earthquakes. One is led to believe that the Turkish nuclear program, which ignores the dangers to the inhabitants and ecosystems of the country and the entire region, serves as a front for a strategy adopted by the political-military authorities of Turkey to acquire nuclear technology that will allow them to equip themselves with nuclear weapons, insofar as they are seeking to acquire the same reactors, of Canadian origin, that India and Pakistan possess. What actions does the Commission intend to take to prevent any nuclear catastrophe and to oppose the acquisition of nuclear weapons by a country that wishes to join the EU and allocates considerable sums to nuclear programs, even while absorbing Community credits in the form of financial assistance?	fr
In many ways, the treatment inflicted on the original inhabitants of the United States of America violates the most fundamental human rights. The story of the Dineh Indians is significant. With the discovery and—certainly—exploitation of black gold and, later, uranium and oil, every means was used to drive these people from their lands and send them to regions offering few prospects other than poverty, deprivation, and pollution. The region of Arizona that is to become the new territory of the Dineh Indians was affected, in 1979, by the largest nuclear disaster in the United States. Therefore, plans are underway to send the last 4,000 Dineh Indians to these lands. The struggle of these Indians is supported by more than 250 NGOs, and we learned about this situation through the work of the Belgian organization For Mother Earth. It is also significant for American society, which has heard little about it. They are rightly concerned about the wars and genocides taking place in other parts of the world, but they unfairly ignore the genocide taking place in their own country. Today, the Dineh Indians are beginning their final fight for their right to land, their right to dignity and, above all, their right to choose their way of life. However, they are only a few, while their adversary is a very powerful economic force. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse many of the comments made by previous speakers, but I would like to emphasize a few more points. The Dineh people are part of the Navajo Indians of North America. They have faced exclusion and have been struggling to survive for decades. They have been living in appalling conditions for many years. The poverty in which they live forces them to reluctantly give in to the financial and economic pressure exerted by the mining industry. The relocation law introduced in 1974, which aimed to redistribute Navajo reservation lands, authorized the displacement of population groups. These relocations are naturally unacceptable because human rights are violated, both economically and socially and culturally. The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and losing in the process not only their history and their essential land—the land of their ancestors—but also any prospects for work and a source of income. The relocation law was pushed through Congress by a group representing the mining industry. Congress never considered where the region's inhabitants should go and what impact this relocation would have on their lives. The population had no say in the matter. This resembles human trafficking. The relocation was carried out, and the Dineh people were moved to a region polluted by uranium. After a dam burst in New Mexico in 1979, releasing 370,000 cubic meters of radioactive water and 1,100 tons of pure uranium, this area is one of the most polluted regions in the world.	fr
Two questions: First, you said you will initiate dialogue with citizens, and I am already starting with 700 trainees at the European Commission. Do you also intend to address citizens via the media, i.e., via television and the Internet? My second question is critical. The European Commission has just submitted a proposal on transparency. If I compare it with the transparency proposal that is working in the Netherlands at legislative level, it is only a pale reflection of it and has attracted much criticism in the Netherlands. My question is therefore the following: how do you intend to steer transparency with regard to the IGC, because the directive we currently have is not a good example of this? Madam Deputy, Minister Maij-Weggen, since we are talking about transparency in relation to the IGC, you know very well how things will be done. Negotiations are starting right now, in fact. The group of representatives is meeting in Brussels, and I will try to join them shortly. The documents will mostly be open documents, working documents. We will not be discussing in front of the media during the negotiation sessions that will take place throughout the year between the ministers and the European Council, but I have committed myself—I cannot do anything else at this stage—to practicing this transparency and to reporting, in the most appropriate forums, on these negotiations and the Commission's point of view. I confirm to you, while thanking you for raising this point with me, that we will use all modern means, television in particular, which will be able to broadcast our public debates in this or that country, or even at European level. We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums. The Commissioners will undertake to respond quickly to all questions that are asked. We will use all these modern means. But I believe that we must also make the effort to reach out to the people as closely as possible. I would like, in all regions of Europe - perhaps this is still a bit utopian - I would like a Commissioner, when he or she can, a Member of the European Parliament, a Minister, to be able to take part in public debates. I have proof that it is possible. Most of you hold these debates in your constituencies, in your regions. From the slightly more selfish point of view of the Commission, I would like this institution, in the minds of citizens, to have a face, for the men and women who make it up to be able to meet citizens as often as possible. Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier's commitment to visiting the regions to explain himself and listen to what citizens have to say. I would like to invite him to my own region, Yorkshire, which participates fully in the European single market and is a major beneficiary of European structural funds. He can go there wearing the two hats he wears as Commissioner. I would like to ask him how vigorously the Commission intends to conduct this information campaign?	fr
One of the most important transfers—the Tajo-Segura transfer—has been in operation for many years, almost 30, and is authorized for 658 hm3 per year. The largest amount transferred in a single year was 453, and the transfer average in 20 years is just over 200. We cannot be accused of poor management. And is the Commissioner aware that, of these 263 hm3, 25 hm3 are used for irrigation on the left bank of the Levante, 30 hm3 for supply in the Júcar area, 7 hm3 for supply in the southern Júcar area, and the remainder in the Segura area, divided equally between supply and irrigation? We are not managing our resources badly either. We cannot be prohibited from making transfers if our economy and the development of our territories depend on them. I am not addressing the issue of quality and available technical improvements because I believe we will renegotiate this directive. But look: in this pluralistic Europe, which we are building in the spirit of Community, we must seek pluralistic, not uniform, solutions. I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council, and this Parliament not to standardize the various European countries in their voting on issues where subsidiarity must be enforced. Commissioner: Andalusia is not Lapland. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank the Committee on the Environment, and especially the rapporteur, Ms. Lienemann, for her ambitious and constructive work on this framework directive for water policy. Water is one of our most important natural resources, as numerous speakers have already emphasized. An ambitious and balanced European water policy is an important aspect of sustainable development in Europe. Water is also one of the areas to which I will devote particular attention during my term of office. I am pleased with the spirit of consensus that permeates the amendments tabled by Parliament. Many of these amendments are based on the extremely constructive, informal discussions that took place between Parliament and the Council during the first reading. Most of the amendments proposed by Parliament improve and tighten up the text. The Commission can accept 72 of the 108 amendments in whole, in part, or in principle. A large number of the amendments tabled by Parliament indicate that conciliation will be unavoidable. With a view to these upcoming negotiations, I therefore appeal to Parliament to vote for an ambitious position. First, I would like to outline some of my main arguments. We now have the opportunity to put the commitments made in the context of the OSPAR Convention into practice. Before we consider making these objectives legally binding, we must first consider their political nature, as reflected in some of Parliament's amendments. Regarding water charges, this directive will determine Europe's water policy for the next three decades. It is therefore our duty to ensure, today, that we find the right incentives and drivers for effective fee structures and pricing that contribute to improving our environment in a cost-effective way.	de
Finally, our resolution clearly establishes that it is essential, in the area of maritime safety, to break out of this infernal spiral of widespread irresponsibility, this pernicious system of mutual paralysis in which States pass the buck to the Union, and the Union to the States, for the greater benefit of the polluter. Let each play its part. Let the Commission, whose American bias has for once not come into play, when it would have been beneficial, define a general framework for maritime safety as soon as possible. This should include minimum age requirements and characteristics for vessels to access Community waters and ports; and a general principle of environmental liability that makes it possible to clarify the responsibilities of the various players, especially shipowners, and to impose harsh sanctions on them. Let the Commission take charge of coordinating information, let it not be afraid to confront the laxity of some large ports or major shipowners, and place the issue of flags of convenience at the heart of the negotiations with Malta and Cyprus. I recall that the Erika was registered in Valletta. However, obviously, States should not be exempted from their own essential responsibility within the Union: the rigor and effectiveness (and therefore the means) of port state control determine the safety of all. We must remain, and will remain, particularly vigilant in the coming months to ensure that the victims, who of course bear no responsibility whatsoever for this catastrophe, are fully compensated by the polluter, and that this time the oil spill truly teaches lessons in maritime safety, so that polluters are definitively dissuaded from risking the lives of our maritime populations. The most effective prevention is to make any potential polluter run the risk of receiving heavy financial penalties. Katiforis report (A5-0017/2000) We agree that fishing is one of the activities most important in promoting respect for the marine environment. However, it is important to bear in mind that many causes contribute to the degradation of marine spaces: pollution from oil tankers and other maritime transport, industrial activity, human pressure on coastal areas, and, of course, uncontrolled fishing. However, it is worth highlighting that small-scale coastal fishing is a good illustration of the possibility of combining fishing activity with sustainable development that is not harmful to the marine environment. We believe it is possible to reconcile a fisheries management policy based on the conservation of the marine environment with the interests of fishing communities. To achieve this, however, it is necessary to take into account, in particular, that there is a correlation between the yield of fishing activity and increased fishing effort. Therefore, measures must be adopted within the scope of the Common Fisheries Policy and adequate financial resources allocated to guarantee the income of those who live exclusively from fishing activity, such as fishermen, particularly in times of cessation or reduction in fishing activity.	es
"Are not thousands of dead and wounded, tens of thousands of refugees enough to justify it? The second country, and I will be very brief on this one, because Mr. Patten knows it very well, is Burma. It is intolerable that we remain silent about Burma. I have the impression that this country is slowly being forgotten. For ten years, an elected president has been under house arrest there. For ten years, parliament has not functioned. Many MPs have been assassinated or fled, and only a small number still reside in Burma. Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Burma are in Thailand and India, and yet it seems that this country is no longer being paid attention to. I think that following the upheavals in Indonesia, Burma should also be put back on the agenda. It is still unacceptable that Ms. Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely abandoned, particularly by Europe. My request is that this country also be placed at the top of our priorities. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Commissioner, the economic power of the European Union cannot be the sole determining factor in its assertiveness in the world. What distinguishes us is the systematic reference to human rights, both at home and among those with whom we maintain relations. The European Parliament has been at the center of the promotion and defense of human rights, which seek to overcome the limits of selfishness and ""national interests"" that are sometimes reflected in the positions of Member States and even other institutions of the European Union. This is why it can be said, for example, that the European Parliament has never forgotten the situation in East Timor, which could have been the worst enemy of a just solution for its people, who have always opposed the Indonesian occupation. This is why we recently opposed the sale of arms to Indonesia, a position that the Council unfortunately ignored. But it is not enough to avoid or put an end to situations of revolting aggression by individuals or institutions against the weakest. The perpetrators of crimes must not go unpunished, whoever they are, wherever they are, in Indonesia, Angola, Cuba, China or Burma, whether they are civilians or military personnel, soldiers, generals or ministers. Justice must be done in Indonesia. Justice must be done in East Timor. President Wahid needs our support to deal with the difficult situation he inherited. It was at the initiative of the EPP that Parliament included a specific reference to East Timor in this resolution at the time. There are those responsible for what happened in this country, some of which I witnessed as a representative of Parliament, and they cannot go unpunished."	fr
I believe, however, that we should do everything possible to limit the transport of dangerous goods as much as possible, in all countries, whether they are transit regions or not. Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive collaboration with the Commission in improving the texts, presenting this report and this proposal; ultimately, only one amendment was tabled, which concerns the requirements for the aptitude test for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway. We believe that the collaboration, the joint work of the two institutions, Parliament and the Commission, is important and that the cooperation that exists with the Committee on Regional Policy, and specifically with the Transport Group, is magnificent. The common position includes practically all the amendments accepted by the Commission, harmonizes the minimum requirements for the examination of safety advisers, and, at second reading, we can accept the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one initially projected by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have been debating this issue for several years now. Very briefly, I would also like to thank the various Members for their contributions and to say that safety is a priority for the Commission in the area of transport. As Mr Simpson so aptly put it, we must never assume that the process is a done deal, that it has concluded. The process of increasing the margins, the safety guarantees in transport, is a process that must be improved day by day. In this sense, I would also like to touch very briefly on the problems of tunnels, to which Mr Rack and Mr Swoboda referred, and which, in the case of Austria, are undoubtedly a very sensitive issue, which is why efforts must be made to see how to increase their safety. In one of the major accidents that occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves. Margarine and a few kilos of paint, which normally did not present a risk, caused a real catastrophe. We must therefore study how we can further adjust the requirements to ensure maximum safety. Finally, I would like to say that it is necessary to address the safety of all types of transport. This week, we will hold a debate here to discuss the safety of maritime transport, following the Erika disaster, and we will have to discuss the safety objectives of air transport throughout this year. But I would like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that safety is a priority objective of the Commission. As I will say during the debate on Erika, we are not waiting for a disaster to occur before devoting ourselves body and soul to the security aspect, but we are working on it in the face of these circumstances, which only highlight the urgency of an effective response to this type of problem.	fr
The Commission must be able to refuse new posts if it is not given more staff. The staff system is too rigid: there must be greater rotation of officials, especially at the top of the hierarchy. It must also be much easier to fire inefficient and incompetent officials. I am therefore very pleased that a reform of the disciplinary procedure is being introduced. The bad experiences so far with disciplinary matters show only too well how necessary a reform is. Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I cannot help thinking that this is essentially an Anglo-Netherlandish-Scandinavian debate, judging by the speakers. I find that a little worrying. I hope, like many others, that the state of emergency in the relations between the Commission and Parliament is about to end. We must get out of this logic, in which we do not even have time to put out one fire before we immediately have to rush to put out another one that has broken out elsewhere. As Mr Blak says, we must instead establish a system in which roles are clear. First of all, we need strict regulation, and we need to apply it. Codes of conduct and ethics committees are not enough. We need strict rules that establish, among other things, what can be decentralised, what can be transferred externally and what must be independent. I find it disturbing that in this debate independence is being praised without specifying in relation to what, and with what decision-making rights. In short, we need to have basic administrative regulations for the Union, for its institutions and for relations with the Member States. That is what is missing. We have asked for a European public prosecutor and criminal law, but the Union also needs its own administrative law. It would certainly be a step forward if the Commission were to accept the proposal, put forward by the Ombudsman, for a binding code of conduct for good administration. The Van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough. Secondly, we must also clearly define our powers in the area of auditing. The Court of Auditors has the task of ascertaining whether or not the rules are complied with, but it must not enter into the merits of the appropriateness of a given act. Political assessments are the prerogative of Parliament, which should not go hunting for thieves, because that is OLAF's job. Tell me which national parliament receives, for example, all the preliminary investigation files! At the risk of sounding stubborn, I would like to add that the regulation on the disclosure of documents must be much better than the draft that is circulating on the Internet, because otherwise we will get nowhere in this battle of ours. Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur most sincerely for his work. I am pleased that I can address him in Dutch, as Mr Van den Berg did. Otherwise I would perhaps have felt a little guilty. This report shows a clear improvement, thanks also to the amendments. I am a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and in our committee a rapporteur is always proud to receive 100 amendments, because he knows he has raised an interesting issue.	it
Böge Report (A5-0023/2000) As a Member of the European Parliament, and above all as a citizen and consumer, I welcome the European Commission's proposal, which represents a further step towards improved food security within the European Union. This proposal has two aspects. On the one hand, it involves amending the 1991 Council Directive on health conditions by abolishing the provisions relating to scrapie in sheep; on the other, it proposes the entry into force of a new regulation laying down the rules for the prevention and control of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), or BSE-type diseases, affecting sheep and other animal species. The idea behind these new rules is to create a specific legal basis for combating scrapie in sheep. I am all the more pleased with this result, given that it was one of our most important demands, which we formulated in our BSE follow-up report. Moreover, I consider it essential, for the sake of consistency, that we integrate the existing scrapie legislation, which is limited to trade in sheep and goats, into a single, comprehensive system of new rules on TSEs, covering all animals throughout the European Union and intended to ensure protection against contaminated food and animal feed. This regulation is all the more welcome given that there are still uncertainties regarding scrapie in sheep. Some scientific hypotheses suggest that scrapie could be a precursor to BSE in cattle and thus the origin of the BSE epidemic. Although the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention and control of certain TSEs still needs to be clarified and expanded—particularly with regard to the detection and control of scrapie—it nevertheless represents a significant improvement. This is a pledge to European citizens, who have frequently expressed their concern about European policy in the food sector. Your concerns, which our European Parliament has taken up, have been heard. The debates on the precautionary principle and issues of traceability, responsibility, and transparency have prompted the European Commission to publish a White Paper on food safety. This White Paper sets out a number of ideas and, most notably, proposes the creation of an independent European food authority. All this is part of a European strategy to regain consumer confidence. Now it is up to us, the European leaders, to prove that the internal market and the free movement of goods can be reconciled with food safety! Cederschiöld report (A5-0008/2000) Mr President, I voted in favor of this recommendation to revise copyright law because I consider it to be one of the most important areas of activity for the European Parliament. In my view, the product of intellectual creation is far more important than the finished constructions, the physical products that we can undoubtedly see and touch, while the mind and science produce results that, although they cannot be touched, are nevertheless of inestimable value. We, as the European Community, should therefore support them far more vigorously, not only through patent protection, but by encouraging and supporting scientists, those who, using their knowledge, do everything they can to offer future generations far more than we have had in the past. We are fundamentally opposed to the European Community concluding copyright treaties on behalf of the Member States.	de
"Consistency, uniformity, and universal standards of good quality in a decentralized system of financial control are ensured by a range of measures. One is to ensure high-quality training; another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over responsibility for financial control unless and until the audit service is absolutely convinced of the robustness of that system. Another measure is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that these standards are implemented and supervised. And there is also the theoretical and practical approach to an effective and independent internal audit service. In a parliamentary reply of this type, I will not go into all the details, but I am sure that upon examination, Mrs. Theato will be able to see that the details of the White Paper give us strong assurances. It will also be demonstrated that we have taken into account the representations in this House, and especially in the Committee on Budgetary Control, which is significant with regard to the use of ex ante visas in the Directorates-General. The ex ante system can be used if it is considered, in a Directorate-General, that it is an important and effective means of improving financial control. Naturally, there are several requirements within the Commission that depend on the number and nature of the financial transactions carried out by each Directorate-General. The White Paper takes this into account too, but when there is a desire or a clear need to use such a system, it must certainly be possible to use it. Lastly, the transition. I share Mrs Theato's reservations about the so-called ""soft legal standard."" We have already had this discussion, and she knows that I distinguish between different forms of codes that can have a very positive effect and which can ultimately be transformed into what we might call a ""hard legal standard."" But in this matter, there is no room, in my opinion, for the ""soft legal standard,"" and that is why, in the transition period, there will be full adherence to the current Financial Regulation until this law is changed through a proper democratic process in this House and the Council. The White Paper fully guarantees this and contains provisions for doing so. In addition, however, and this is very important because this is a transition period, there will be training, advice, support, guarantees, and the new head of the audit unit will take full office on 1 May. With all this and a number of other guarantees, I think we can be as confident as possible that the system will be completely safe even during the transition period. I must make two further points because this is a key issue at the heart of the reform. My first observation is that citizens believe - for reasons I understand very well - that this transition carries risks of either irresponsibility or inertia."	fr
This will determine who is prepared to vote for the legally dubious retroactive nature of the measure, which would be costly for future car buyers and represent a devastating blow to the European automotive industry. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly address the economic consequences of this directive and express my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague Bernd Lange, as they have the advantage—and I would like to emphasize this point in particular—of reconciling environmental requirements with economic necessity. The Council's common position stated that vehicle manufacturers must bear all or most of the costs of take-back and recycling. However, as Mr Lange so aptly pointed out, this solution would place European manufacturers at a severe disadvantage. Coming from a car-making country, I can tell you that it would be impossible to retroactively impose on car manufacturers the full financial responsibility for all their brand's vehicles currently in use, in other words, the cost of 80% of the European vehicle fleet. This solution is unacceptable, because these manufacturers have not had the opportunity to incorporate the environmental requirements we now impose on them into their manufacturing processes and their cost price. The common position puts European car manufacturers in a less favourable position than newcomers to the European market. Of course, our task here is not to defend this or that national interest or this or that industrial lobby; our task is, far more, to defend Europe's competitiveness on the global market and jobs in the sectors in which we are genuinely competitive. I therefore call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange, which are also supported by the Group of European Socialists, because they actually reconcile all the concerns at stake - economic interests and environmental requirements - and leave it up to the Member States to decide how they wish to implement these requirements. These amendments provide for the continued existence of the systems already in place in the Member States - some of which work quite well. Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a directive on end-of-life vehicles, which we are debating today, aims, on the one hand, to ensure a high level of environmental protection within the Union and, on the other, to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market. I should just like to mention briefly that historic vehicles and classic cars must, of course, be excluded from the scope of the directive because, I think, we would all agree that they are part of our cultural heritage. However, there are differences of opinion, among other things, on Article 12, that is, the date from which the directive applies. The solution proposed by Parliament, namely 18 months after the directive's entry into force for vehicles first registered after that date, is hardly realistic. The European vehicle fleet includes tens of millions of cars that must be taken back without recycling requirements having been taken into account in their design. The Common Position would be more practical, as it provides for 2006 for vehicles already registered.	de
I note that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything, but I must ensure that questions are put and answers given at this sitting. Mr Rübig has the floor. Mr President, fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions on a Member State because a democratically elected government was formed there. Both parties have participated in the government before. To date, no violations of rights have been reported. Are preventive sanctions compatible with the Charter of Human Rights? Would a right of veto for the President-in-Office of the Council over the formation of national governments be compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights? Is the call for violent demonstrations compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights? Mr President-in-Office, as President-in-Office of the Council, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister was made on behalf of fourteen Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the European Union at bilateral level and not as President of the European Union. I would like to say, however, that the complex of preventive measures implemented by these Member States of the European Union at a strictly bilateral level includes steps which, I would say, are politically preventive at the diplomatic level. We consider them entirely justified and consider that they meet the demands of what would be appropriate in the face of the actions of a party and of representatives of a party who, it seems to us, as participants in a European Union government, offer no guarantees that they can fulfill the Union's objectives. I do not wish to dwell on this issue on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union, because this concerns an intervention by my government, undertaken at the request of and in cooperation with fourteen Member States, and not as the Presidency of the European Union. Mr President, I have the honor of being part of the group drafting the Charter, and I will therefore not ask the Council to speculate on the content of the Charter or to provide information on whether the Charter should be programmatic or legally binding. I would like to know what will happen to the draft charter drawn up by the working group. Will the Council consider this draft a document that it must accept in its current form, or will it reserve the right to amend it as it sees fit? Will the Council simply approve or reject this document, or will it have the right to redraft the draft charter? The answer is neither yes nor no. I do not know, Mr President; that will depend on the decision taken at Council level. Question No 8 (H-0042/00): Subject: The granting of export credit guarantees and their role in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey. At the G8 meeting in Cologne, the OECD was called upon to prepare the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits. These credits can be used to distort competition or to support questionable projects. Will the EU take a leading role in establishing common standards? The need for this was demonstrated recently by the British Government's announcement that it intended to grant an export credit to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.	de
"I therefore believe, as Amendment No 10 expresses, that today's debate should lead us to call for a rapid suspension of this policy of sanctions. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we did not have to wait for the end of the conflict in Kosovo to realise that, after several wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia with their negative consequences for the stability of the Balkan area, a comprehensive and lasting strategy for the whole region would be necessary in order to guarantee peace and stability in south-eastern Europe. This strategy, outlined in the Stability Pact approved on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, takes into account the region of south-eastern Europe in its entirety, while recognising the differences and disparities in development of the various countries which are part of it. The European Union's contribution under the Stability Pact, the so-called ""Stabilization and Association Process"", is the development of the regional concept developed by the European Community in 1996 for the five countries of the region - Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania - the most significant aspect of which was to establish political and economic conditions to facilitate the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement, which should thus contribute to the stability of the region. An important contribution to the stability of the Balkans consists in establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis, with a view to the full integration of that country into the European Union through the mechanism provided for by the Stabilization and Association Process. The necessary prerequisite is that the countries concerned are prepared to accept a certain number of conditions. We believe that a strong political signal should be sent to these countries that one day they can be ours, while obviously respecting their sovereignty. Without any illusions, the mandate we are giving the Commission today can constitute, once agreement is reached, the first decisive step towards peace and stability in a region so troubled, whose peoples have already shown that they can legitimately aspire to be part of our area of freedom and development. We cannot add further suffering to that endured under the Soviet yoke and to the price they later had to pay when forced to become part of the Communist bloc. As far as we know, from a political and economic point of view, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is now in a position to establish new contractual relations with the European Union, going even beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 June 1998 which aims, in practice, to respect the acquis communautaire, especially in key areas of the internal market. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will certainly have to make great efforts, but, given the political and economic reforms already introduced under the Cooperation Agreement and the adoption of transitional periods in certain areas, this country will be able to meet the conditions for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Sharing the view that the development of the region is also a factor of internal stability, confirming the negotiating mandate as proposed to us and underlining that this is a bilateral agreement with the European Union, we agree with the rapporteur when he notes that this is the first concrete application of an integrated and long-term strategy for South-Eastern Europe and that the main question is how the Balkans will be structured in the future in order to ensure peace and stability."	it
All of these elements must be applied cumulatively. It is also important to bear in mind that there is a wide range of measures that can be adopted when using the precautionary principle. For example, a research program, outreach campaigns, recommendations, etc. Recourse to the precautionary principle, therefore, does not automatically imply a prohibition. This communication is not intended to be the final word on this matter; however, it is the first time that the Commission has made a structured presentation of the principle and its operational application. By setting out in detail how the Commission applies and intends to apply the precautionary principle, we hope to clarify the situation at the Community level and contribute to the debate taking place at the European and international levels. Mr. President, Commissioner, thank you very much for the explanation. I have three brief questions. First: we have had to wait a long time for a Commission opinion on the precautionary principle, and in the past, it was not at all clear whether the Commission spoke with one voice. Is what you have expressed here today also the opinion of your colleague the Commissioner for Industry, your colleague the Commissioner for External Trade, your colleague the Commissioner for Competition, and your colleague the Commissioner for the Internal Market? You will undoubtedly tell me yes, but I would like to know from you whether these gentlemen also know what consequences it has. The next question, Mrs. Wallström: when will you begin to apply this in legislation, for example, in laws on chemicals or in other areas? The last question: will we be able to recognize where this has been applied in the laws? In other words, will there be an additional statement in each proposal stating that the precautionary principle has been examined and that this result has been reached? Thank you very much, Mrs. Roth-Behrendt, for these questions. Naturally, the entire Commission shares them. This is a joint communication drafted by three of us—Mr. Byrne, Mr. Liikanen, and myself—but it was unanimously adopted today by the Commission. It has received the strong support of the other Commissioners and has been submitted for consultation across the various Commission services. We have therefore worked extensively on this document, and I am sure that all Commissioners are familiar with the guidelines and principles set out in this document. Yes, I would like to say that we already use this working method in the case of several difficult issues, such as a new strategy on chemicals, for example. And I am sure that we will also explicitly mention it when we work with this principle. We recently had a case in which the precautionary principle was used when the use of phthalates had to be banned in the manufacture of soft PVC toys, and we naturally apply it in various environmental areas. This principle has been used primarily in the environmental field and also, naturally, in other areas relating to public health.	es
The other principle of the Council's common position in the draft directive is retroactive. However, it contradicts all generally accepted economic and legal principles to retroactively impose financial responsibility on a manufacturer for its product. It would also retroactively alter the owner's responsibility, because a consumer may have modified the product in various ways over the years. All EU Member States currently have laws regulating the scrapping of cars. These vary from country to country. However, pending the implementation of this EU directive, each member state in the Union should regulate the disposal of end-of-life vehicles as best as possible so that EU regulations do not become retroactive. This does not preclude a financing model through the creation of funds. Mr. President, the environmental and economic importance of this directive is obvious and widely recognized. The common position represents an acceptable compromise, but one that is rather difficult and precarious, so that there is only very limited scope for improvement if the entire directive is not to be jeopardized. I therefore maintain that Parliament must not impose anything, and it would be paradoxical if it did so at the expense of diminishing the environmental impact of the directive. I would point out that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive; the costs are not excessive: disposing of a car costs less than 1% of the purchase price of a new one. Moreover, the financial liability of manufacturers will not come into force until 2006, when a large proportion of the vehicles currently on the market will no longer be on the market. For the remaining vehicles, provision could be made for a form of cost-sharing, as proposed in Amendments Nos 44 and 45 tabled by Mr Lange, which, in my view, are the only ones consistent with the balance of the common position and with experience in certain countries and therefore deserve to be supported. Mr President, this is an extremely bad directive. First of all, as my colleague Mr Bowis pointed out, it is retroactive in nature, and that is fundamentally wrong. Second, it imposes enormous costs on the European automotive industry, which would have a detrimental impact on competitiveness and the labor market. We in this Parliament constantly talk about the need to stimulate the European labor market, yet we continually adopt measures that result in a reduction in jobs. In my view, the directive is also bad in other respects, which have not been sufficiently addressed in this debate. It is like many European regulations. It is far too prescriptive. It imposes a specific recycling model. The assembly line was, if I am not mistaken, invented by Henry Ford about a hundred years ago, and what we are proposing here is essentially the establishment of an assembly line like the one in the 19th century, only this one runs backwards, dismantling vehicles and disassembling the individual components for recycling. However, we should pause for a moment and consider that the sales prospects for recycled plastic bumpers are extremely uncertain. The plastics industry does not want these products back and cannot afford to take them back. There is already a very successful industry that shreds cars, recovers metals and generates energy by burning the non-metal parts.	de
"As regards the former, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and an action plan, which aim to implement the following decision taken by the Heads of Government in Tampere: ""to ensure fair treatment of third-country nationals residing legally in the territory of the Member States. A more incisive integration policy should aim to guarantee them rights and obligations similar to those of Union citizens"". Precisely the opposite, Mr President, of what we have seen and discovered in recent days in El Ejido: a world of irregularity, exploitation and indecent living conditions, which had already been denounced. I hope for a prompt adoption of the integration measures and I also hope that the governments that wrote such beautiful words in Tampere - including the Spanish Government - will make every effort to implement them. I have less hope for the development of an effective and fair European policy, consistent with the Council's declarations on immigration. The only proposal put forward is the directive on family reunification - a key issue, given that in recent days the media have shown us many single men in El Ejido -, but we do not know whether it has already been accepted by governments. Outside the community, some governments are working to renew their immigration policy. This is also what is happening in my country, but in spite of the government; in fact, the majority party is the only one that does not like the new immigration law. The objective of combating racism and xenophobia, explicitly stated in the Treaties, should also be the objective of all the institutions and all the political leaders of the Union. On 28 February 1998, the European political parties signed the Charter of European political parties for a non-racist society. The Popular Party did so too. This obliges it to behave consistently, but the local leaders of this party are pouring fuel on the fire, boycotting the attempts by other institutions to put it out. The party to which the mayor of El Ejido belongs should act decisively and unequivocally, in accordance with the commitments made in that declaration. Only with great unity, as the Honourable Hernández Mollar said, with responsibility and with firmness, will El Ejido be able to overcome, together with Spain and Europe, those episodes that today cause us deep shame. Mr President, one can only feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of lynching against Moroccan newspaper workers that have taken place in El Ejido. We do not know how much of the responsibility lies with the racist commandos of the extreme right, nor how much is attributable to the ordinary people who were reckless enough to associate with these groups. We would like to reiterate our full solidarity with Moroccan workers who are not only exploited by unscrupulous employers, but also find themselves subjected to attacks of this kind. If among the attackers there are people from the poorest strata of the population, we can only tell them that they are digging their own graves."	it
And finally, and I'll end with this, the requirement relates to the future powers of the European Parliament in the areas at hand, competition policy and State aid, in the perspective of the Intergovernmental Conference. Our report, as you know, Commissioner, advocates the idea of the codecision procedure being in force for basic State aid legislation. (DE) Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my participation in this debate concerns the Steel Aid Code, that is, public aid granted in Europe in accordance with that Code and supervised by the Commission. In 1998, a total of 27 cases were examined, on which the Commission has prepared its own report. The ECSC Treaty is due to expire very soon. Therefore, the issue that should concern us today is above all the future application of aid to the steel industry. The European Parliament welcomes the decisions outlined by the Commission in its report, including the one concerning the repayment of aid received in a specific case, pursuant to Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty. The Commission's most recent communication, which has not yet been debated in Parliament, also addresses the issue of the competitiveness of the European steel industry. The general prohibition of State aid established in Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the ferro-steel industry, just as it does to other sectors. Pursuant to this article, State aid is in principle incompatible with the Common Market. Exceptions are permitted only in precisely defined cases. Pursuant to Article 88, the Commission is obliged to monitor State aid. In 1998, the most important case was the equity injection of €540 million to the Preussag company in Germany. Member States must also notify the Commission in advance of any aid they intend to grant. The rules applicable to the steel industry were established on December 18, 1996. According to these rules, aid may only be granted to the steel industry in certain precisely defined cases. These include aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social assistance to encourage the closure of steel plants, and aid for the permanent abandonment of the activity in the case of uncompetitive companies. In addition, there is an exception for Greece, with a maximum limit of €50 million. In recent years, however, there have been obvious problems in the practical application of the Steel Aid Code, which are not fully detailed in the report. From Parliament's point of view, it is important to begin debating consecutive regulations now for the time when the current Steel Aid Code expires. The fundamental principles of this Code should not be watered down. No one wants to open the door to uncontrolled competition based on subsidies in Europe. This would seriously affect the functioning of the internal market, even after the consolidation of the steel industry in recent years. Parliament therefore considers it necessary to amend the Steel Aid Code with regard to the unequal treatment denounced by the industry and for the Commission to submit consecutive regulations to the Council.	es
Unfortunately, I missed any reference to the corresponding standards. I wonder where you got these standards and values from. I am convinced that the Bible, the Word of God, is the only pure source of demanding standards and genuine values. This insight, which has grown in the tradition of our continent, is a crucial element that deserves due recognition. Madam President, Mr. President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know which to base my decision on—the strategic objectives for 2000-2005 or your speech for 2000-2010? Have you already included your second term in office? But seriously. The enlarging Union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and limitation. First, streamlining. What you say in your program about concentrating on the Commission's core tasks can only be a very first step. The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to the core areas of policy. These are the social and ecological orientation of the market, the safeguarding of the currency, the guarantee of citizens' rights internally, and the representation of common interests externally. It is not just a matter of speaking with one voice in the world, but even more importantly what we want to say with that voice. Secondly, the new buzzword is flexibility. But increasing flexibility can, or threatens to, very quickly lead to intergovernmentalism. We must firmly adhere to linking the member states through joint decision-making bodies. This also applies, incidentally, to the involvement of civil society, which is to be welcomed. But citizens do not need new bodies or institutions, and certainly not a new mixing of responsibilities. (Applause) Transparency is not more access to more paper; rather, transparency for citizens is finally more clarity about who, when, what, and with what authority decides in Brussels and Strasbourg. That is transparency! Thirdly, the European Union cannot and must not expand without limits. Its limits arise not from the question of how many states want to join, but how many it can accommodate. (Applause) If the price for enlargement were the weakening or even the dissolution of the existing Union, then it should not be paid. It would be too high, not just for the Member States that are already there, but also for the states that want to be admitted to this Union. A Union that is merely a geostrategic concept has no future, just as one that is merely a free trade zone has no future. But the Union will remain more than a market and will only receive legitimacy from the peoples of Europe if it sees itself as a community of shared destiny. That is far more than just your new economic and social policy agenda or a new and improved quality of life. Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament, but also the peoples and states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and act together. This involves nothing less than reinventing the European Union without destroying the existing one! (Applause) Madam President, in the view of the Liberal, Democrat and Reform Group, the most important task of the Commission and of the Union as a whole is to ensure the successful implementation of enlargement.	de
"At the same time, financial support through the PHARE programme can also be essential. However, the EU's policy in the Balkans is currently fragmented, disorganised and contradictory. There are various types of agreements or relationships - or lack thereof - that lead to the embargo in Yugoslavia and create a fragmented and ineffective approach. The concept of regionalisation for the Balkans, which includes everyone without exclusions and without a spirit of revenge, is missing. Finally, it is necessary and useful for the European Union to intervene in resolving the FYROM name issue, which, unfortunately, is dragging on and could lead to greater tensions. It is also necessary and useful for it to intervene in a more active and time-limited management of the negotiations between the FYROM authorities. The Commission's expressed desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and to open up to the latter the prospect of full integration into the Community, seems to us to respond to a priority concern: the construction of a political entity respectful of nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these South-Eastern European states, which history, since the end of the Second World War, has not spared. After being crushed by the jackboot of triumphant communism, the region has not finished, since the beginning of the 1990s, paying the price for the collapse of the Soviet system. However, in this difficult context, and more particularly since NATO's military intervention in the Balkans, some of these states, all authentically European, have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which legitimizes their aspirations for integration into the Community. In this respect, the case of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both exemplary and emblematic. Exemplary because it proves that the Balkan states are not bound by any inevitability and that they are, for those who have the will, already today able to meet the usual requirements of the stabilisation and association agreements required by the European Union. Emblematic because it positively illustrates the Fifteen's plan to see the emergence of a common policy for the five countries of the region (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM and Albania) which would make economic and political stabilisation a burning and urgent obligation. The UEN group is all the more in agreement with sending this signal to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it gives due importance to the independence and sovereignty of States: if a satisfactory solution cannot be found in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the States that compose them, there can be no question of blocking their integration process on the grounds that one of their own is deemed unworthy of such promotion. The Union is fulfilling its role when it seeks, through its cooperation policy, to encourage nations to embrace with it a foundation of common values of which democracy and the freedom of citizens are the cornerstone. It departs from this role when it substitutes itself for the peoples in its choices, or failing that, it reinvents a new form of ""sense of History"" which only grasps the notion of self-determination of peoples in one direction."	fr
The majority of Members of this Parliament do not want this situation, but we must be careful in our choice of means so that we do not achieve the opposite of what we want. Madam President, dear colleagues, I emphatically reject all declarations, expressions, or feelings of xenophobia or racism. I vigorously defend the good of human rights and the rule of law that are inherent in Europe. But precisely for this reason, I do not agree with the senseless actions initiated by the Presidency (unfortunately, the Portuguese Presidency) on behalf of the other fourteen states, in a truly institutional blunder. This is not the way to combat extremism. It may even be a way to do it a very welcome favor. The flood of confused and hasty measures that have been launched against Austria are throwing everything into disarray without any sense or reason, creating great uncertainty among honest citizens, and harboring dangers that have not been taken into account. There is an insurmountable contradiction between positions that have been adopted in the name of upholding human rights and the rule of law, but which at the same time violate the fundamental rights of Austrians and disregard the crucial rules of the rule of law, in this case the norms of the Treaties. What do we ultimately want to achieve by embarking on an intergovernmental conference? A Europe of 27 or a Europe of 14, or an even smaller Europe? We are for Europe, for a Europe that honors all the steps that have brought us here, for a Europe that respects the Treaties and the law, for a Europe in which Austria is needed. This must be said! Madam President, I am pleased and proud that this Parliament has overwhelmingly condemned the formation of a coalition government in Austria that includes Mr. Haider's Freedom Party. Mr. Haider has demonstrated in word and deed over the past few years that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse. Not only did he express admiration for Adolf Hitler, praise the Waffen-SS, and refuse to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma, he is also a member of the regional government of Carinthia. He has led the way in abolishing measures in favor of Austria's Slovene minority and in support of immigrants. Some have said we have no right to interfere in Austrian politics. They are wrong. The European treaties oblige us to protect fundamental rights. Some have said we must accept the results of democratic elections. But democratic elections do not make democrats out of those who threaten democracy. The same argument against Germany in the 1930s led to the tragedy of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of six million Jews. But we should not condemn Mr. Haider for his ambition. He will not change on this point. The real culprits are Austria's Christian Democrats, who have become Judas and resurrected a threat to Europe that we thought had perished in Berlin in 1945.	de
- (DE) Mr President, I would like to preface my supplementary question with a Tibetan greeting wishing happiness and peace. In Tibet, it is not just human rights and the environment that are at stake, but also a unique cultural heritage that can convey important values to us Europeans too, including calm, slowness and empathy, compassion as the Dalai Lama calls it. The question that arises is what the Commission can do to support His Holiness the Dalai Lama and his proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibetan question. I would point out that inaction means the death of Tibetan culture and the end of the Tibetan people. I have great sympathy for what the honourable Member has said about the cultural heritage and the Buddhist tradition. Like the honourable Member, I have read the Dalai Lama's autobiography, which is an extremely moving account, not only of his responsibility in Tibet and towards Tibet, but also of his spiritual convictions. The Commission, like others, has called for a dialogue. The Dalai Lama has made it clear that what he wants is a peaceful dialogue. I would have liked the Chinese authorities to have reacted consistently and positively to the Dalai Lama's openness. During President Clinton's visit to China, or at least around that time, the President of the People's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda. This would not only be beneficial for Tibet and all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be very much to the advantage of the Government of the People's Republic of China if it responded to the attempts to open up a dialogue. Question No 31, by the Honourable Member (H-0795/99): Subject: Rejection by the Commission of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour in the European Union According to press reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal of the European Ombudsman, Mr Jacob Söderman, to grant citizens the right to good administrative behaviour in the European Union. The Commission itself has approved the idea of a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, but has not accepted the specific proposal for it, limiting itself to providing a series of additional indications for a better service. Can the Commission say whether these reports are true, what the reason is for this behaviour and how it explains the difference which has arisen between the statements and the facts on the reform of the Community administration; whether it considers that the incident is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between the European Parliament and the Commission in September, and whether it is in a position to present a detailed proposal for a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour on which Parliament can also take a position? Commissioner Patten may speak on behalf of the Commission. The press reports to which the Honourable Member refers seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate. In November 1999, the Commission approved at first reading a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour to be included in its Rules of Procedure. The Commission is currently consulting staff representatives on this document, a process which should be concluded in the coming weeks, at the end of which the Commission will approve the Code at second reading.	it
Mr Pietrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission's proposal, particularly those relating to the development of a vaccine and the introduction of compensation for farmers who are forced to cull their fish. However, we are not at all happy about the prospect of changing the culling policy. It has been said that Norway has done a better job than we have in controlling the outbreak of infectious salmon anaemia and that the proposed changes will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach; however, there are more than a few differences between the Norwegian policy and the EU policy, which will also apply in my home country of Ireland in the unfortunate event that similar cases arise. There are other differences between the two policies in relation to disease inspections, periods of inactivity, restrictions on the movement of fish and contaminated material, and so on. Before we rush to copy the Norwegian culling policy, we need to test these methods to see whether they can reduce the scale of the disaster. BSE has been discussed in the past and the Greens have been calling for this disease to be addressed for many years. If this had been done, a great many farmers could have been saved and a great deal of money would have been saved at Community level. It is also a matter of protecting the environment, farmers and public health. I would like to thank Mrs Hudghton for her excellent report on BSE and for supporting the measures proposed by the Commission, and I would also like to thank all the speakers for taking part in the debate on this issue. The Commission's proposal is designed to ensure a more pragmatic approach to controlling a disease which has the potential to cause major losses to salmon farms. However, this approach must not in any way affect our aim of reducing and, if possible, eliminating the disease and cannot be adopted if the proposal contains a threat to public health. Furthermore, the environmental implications must be taken seriously. Experts say that BSE is considered a non-pathogenic disease for humans and mammals. Since its appearance in 1984, no case of infection in humans or mammals has been reported. The virus affects cold-blooded animals and does not reproduce at temperatures above 25oC. Even if it were present in fish intended for human consumption, it would be inactivated once ingested. In any case, infected fish cannot be used for food and, as an extra precaution, I confirm this to the Scientific Committee. A number of important issues have been raised in the debate in relation to our strategy for controlling the disease, including compensation. I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry. As you know, from 15 January 2000, Member States can promote the eradication of the disease in aquaculture with the help of a new financial instrument for the provision of fisheries information. The Commission services are currently preparing implementing rules which will enable this instrument to be put into practice. Council Decision 90/424 constitutes another Community instrument for financial support in the event of disease outbreaks.	it
It is an indisputable fact that the turnout in the European elections was low. To improve it, we can act now and fight crime in Europe with a Europe-wide approach. - (DE) Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur. The Theato report can help to restore trust in the European institutions, and I think we all recognise the urgency of this, if we think about the results and the low turnout in the last European elections. Every year the same problem arises: the Court of Auditors in its report denounces various frauds committed by the Member States, but for now the European institutions have too few instruments to act and ensure that a concrete response is taken to remedy this state of affairs. So every year this procedure leads to a loss of trust. In my opinion, the report and the proposal by Mrs Theato could help to reverse this trend, by making it clear that the European institutions are ensuring that European financial resources are used wisely and without fraud. A first step has already been taken with the transformation of UCLAF into OLAF, an independent institution. Now it is important to take the second step, creating a clear legal framework within which OLAF can act. For this reason we need a European Public Prosecutor's Office that also provides precise legal guarantees to those under investigation. I must add with regret that my group will not approve this report unanimously, and I hope that some of my colleagues will review their position during the debate. Unfortunately, there are still strong fears that a European institution will be created here at the expense of subsidiarity. I will do my part to ensure that Mrs Theato's report meets with broader consensus. Mr President, we are essentially in favour of the resolution that has been submitted to us, even if we believe that this can only be an invitation from Parliament to the Council to ensure, through a change in the Treaties, effective criminal protection of the Union's financial interests. The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor and the creation of criminal figures common to all countries of the Union is undoubtedly a good idea, but I believe it is impossible to think of implementing it without first having introduced a Union judicial system. We are talking, in fact, about criminal law, the field in which the resistance of the national States to communitarization is and will always be strong. It is unthinkable, in fact, that substantive and procedural legal norms can be created for a single sector, such as the protection of financial interests, without first having created a European judicial system. It is sufficient to read the precise and exhaustive motivations of the Theato report to realize how many and what problems still need to be solved. This idea should be encouraged, however, and there is no doubt that it is precisely during this attempt to protect financial interests that the need for a Community corpus juris to be introduced into the Treaties will be realized. On behalf of myself and my group, I also express the hope that the financial soul of the Union will lead the way in creating a European judicial system that respects the rights and guarantees of citizens, that is to say, a judicial system that raises the guarantees that, unfortunately, in many States are not at an acceptable level.	it
Mrs Rothe, let me put it this way: I am convinced that the current context has improved for reaching such agreements. I have no commitments at the moment. Nor do I expect them until we have started direct discussions. They will come later. The context has changed because the Helsinki decisions made a great many things finally possible and, above all, because the participants have completely changed their political strategy. I have always believed that the old position, according to which Cyprus would only join once the political conflict was resolved, contained a weakness, in that it did not convincingly stimulate the Turkish Cypriot community to really get involved, because, faced with this strategy, the Turkish community had nothing to do but sit back and wait. The question of Cyprus's accession would then not have been raised. Now the Turkish community must seriously reckon with the risk that Cyprus will actually join the European Union, with the growing prospects for well-being and security that this brings for the Greek community, while the already much less prosperous Turkish community continues to be left behind. I am therefore firmly convinced that the motivation to link the peace process to the settlement of the conflict has increased enormously since Helsinki. That was also the underlying idea. After a few weeks, it is still too early, Madam, to already make an assessment, but I certainly have no reason to assume that the new course of action will fail. There is no reason for that. There is still no reason to say that we will succeed, but I can truly say that the conditions for progress have improved considerably. Lastly, the Cyprus question obviously plays a role in the discussions with Turkey. During my meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister a few weeks ago in Brussels, I naturally urged Turkey to adopt a positive and constructive attitude towards this issue. I have the following reservation, however: we cannot be 100% certain – at least I am not – that all it takes is to press a button in Ankara for everything to work in Cyprus! It has not been that simple for a long time. Instead, we must strive, in our discussions with both communities, to bring them to an agreement. This is what we are doing; we have funds and programs for this. I must make it clear to you that I need the Financial Regulation submitted for your decision before we can begin. The Financial Regulation is the legal framework for addressing the priorities set out in the partnerships with Cyprus and Malta. I cannot begin anything without it; I lack the legal basis. If the so-called lack of coherence has anything to do with this specific point, I would like to say that this Regulation is a legal framework and nothing else.	fr
I would like to know whether the document the Commission has just presented provides for such a clause. Thank you very much, Inger Schörling. These are two important questions. I am pleased to have the opportunity to clarify them. No, we should not start with a cost-benefit analysis, but rather based on an assessment of what we know, what science can teach us, and how we should consider it in relation to the risks we believe exist for the environment or for human and animal health. On the other hand, once we have decided to take a certain measure, we must then choose one that is cost-effective, so as not to adopt measures that are completely absurd from the point of view of effectiveness. We should therefore not start with a cost-benefit analysis. The other question concerns the reversal of the burden of proof. It is absolutely true that we need to apply this in certain cases. I took the case of the chemicals strategy as a good example of an area where it is necessary. It is indeed this area, but one could say that this communication on the precautionary principle is horizontal; it concerns all specific policy areas. That is why it is not specifically a question of a reversal of the burden of proof in this regard or what the burden of proof will look like, but rather of political decision-making and the basis for it. However, it is absolutely true that we must, for example, when it comes to chemicals, ensure that we achieve a reversal of the burden of proof. Mr President, I believe that, in order to work, the precautionary principle should be quite radical, otherwise we constantly get lost in the tortuous twists and turns of interpretation. Let us take an example: it has been shown that an anticryptogamic product causes blind children; it is therefore teratogenic. Very well, it's an anticryptogamic, an antimycotic. It was a British laboratory that proved the teratogenic effect, perhaps the only one, however, to have carried out tests. Well, in my opinion, since the threat is so serious for health, the precautionary principle requires that the product be immediately withdrawn from the market, as New Zealand has done, for example. I would therefore like to ask the following question: when human health is at stake, or when serious effects on human health are possible, should we analyse the costs and benefits? A blind child is too high a price in my opinion; no profit could compensate for it. I would like to know whether, ultimately, the precautionary principle as you understand it, Commissioner, would presuppose in this case that the product be withdrawn from sale until other laboratories provide proof to the contrary. Mr President, I am the first to hope that we can use the precautionary principle in such a way that it is considered radical in terms of protecting human health and the environment.	fr
The White Paper and the report come at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection, discussion and reform, which is not yet concluded, as various questions remain to be clarified, both from us, from the judges, from the Member States and above all from the small and medium-sized enterprises concerned. Competition policy must continue to be managed centrally and cannot be renationalised, because that would be risky for the internal market and for Europe's position in the world economy, but must be Europeanised within the framework of subsidiarity. I therefore also welcome the fact that responsibility begins with the individual, without however the Commission shirking its own. Practical experience - with only nine cases rejected and 94 per 100 of the cases submitted to the Commission resolved not formally, but through non-public and legally non-binding administrative letters, or simply because the deadlines expired - clearly shows that the Commission's activity has been affected by the temporal, personal and financial constraints of the era of globalisation and the enlargement of the European Union. In conclusion, I would like to announce my expectations for the reform: fair competition and a level playing field, legal certainty for all companies, uniform application of competition policy, procedural simplification based on the one-stop-shop principle, coordination of national competition authorities, which I consider autonomous, a close relationship between national authorities and judges and the Commission, as well as a clear allocation of competences between national authorities and judges when it comes to applying European competition law; I expect the Commission to focus on the essentials in fulfilling its mandate as the ultimate guardian of European competition policies. I am curious to see what form the ongoing extensive discussions will take when they lead to the first legislative proposal. The Commission's report confirms that, with the exception of Germany, state aid to companies is increasing and this worries the Commission, not only from the point of view of the conditions of competition. As far as we are concerned, we are looking at it from the perspective of the interests of the working classes. Society does not benefit from these huge transfers of public funds to private companies. Just look at the automotive sector, where state subsidies and other aid increased by 24 percent during the reporting period. For what purpose? Not to maintain employment, because all these companies have cut jobs and laid off workers. Not to improve working conditions, because by making fewer workers produce more, working conditions get worse. Did these companies need state aid to survive? No, the companies in the automotive sector have been raking in colossal profits for years. State aid not only has perverse effects, because, as Mr Jonckheer's report acknowledges, it leads to the hunt for subsidies through transfers of activities from one country to another, but it is also unacceptable, because it uses public money to enrich a handful of private shareholders. The fact that the richest are favoured everywhere with state money has led to the deterioration of the welfare state, the abandonment of public services and the closure of hospitals throughout Europe.	it
Faced with this changing global framework, we must find our appropriate position. Fortunately, evaluations of EC aid provide us with an important means of improving what we are doing and, hopefully, also of overcoming the challenges I have just mentioned. To address the results of the evaluations in more detail, I would like to mention the following problems: objections to Community policy are too numerous and too vague, and this negatively affects coherence. This situation is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to some very clear inconsistencies between sectoral policies and the interests of the Member States. The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and too fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures, and institutional mechanisms. Policies are often determined more by the instruments available than by their intended objectives and clearly defined priorities. Human resources are too scarce in relation to the volume of aid we are supposed to manage. On average, there are 2.9 people in the Commission managing $10 million in aid, compared to 4.3 at the World Bank and between four and nine in the main Member States. This poses a real problem: there are many very different financial instruments, each with its own characteristics and, in particular, a number of different budget headings. It is difficult to reconcile this situation with the needs of an effective management system. In order to confront and resolve these problems, the Community must engage in effective dialogue with the Member States and Parliament. It is absolutely essential that we address the issue of coherence realistically and pragmatically, which means holding the debate within the appropriate institutional framework, that is, in the Council and Parliament. The lack of concerted action among the 15 Member States and between them and the Community also requires study. If we focus Community development policy on internationally agreed strategies and objectives, we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States. This largely coincides with what Minister Amado has just said. When we talk about policies today, we are referring to a process of convergence. This already provides part of the solution. We are in the midst of formulating new regulatory guidelines and need to identify priority areas for Community action. Everything is becoming increasingly complicated. The same applies to development cooperation. No single donor is capable of addressing the full range of issues, from macroeconomic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new interrelated themes such as gender, the environment, good governance, and institutional reforms. It is important to find flexible mechanisms that can accommodate a division of labor according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country. This must be done at the Member State level and should lead us to the formulation of sectoral policies for Community action. That is what we want to achieve. In order to identify priority areas for EC support, the specific characteristics of the Community in relation to the Member States and international institutions must be taken into account.	es
"This current economic context is very much on our minds, as the objective of these restructurings is to rationalize corporate management. While it is economically plausible to make structural changes to become more competitive and gain market share, this analysis can be condemnable when it is carried out at the request of financiers, often shareholders, with the sole, unspeakable goal of increasing the financial values of these companies, and thus be able to increase the profits they will thereby obtain. In this sense, the various recent announcements mentioned by my colleagues, both in the case of Michelin and Goodyear, are symptomatic. Rationalized management, as well as improved results—in my opinion, and in order of priority—must be at the service of the company and, therefore, of the workers, and then, eventually, the resulting financial consequences. Now, today we are witnessing a phenomenon of concentration, corporate regrouping, and offshoring, with the consequences we are familiar with—both in terms of product quality and specifically on the social level—from the perspective of unemployment, more difficult working conditions, and greater flexibility, consequences that are dramatic on the human level, especially for the family unit. There is, therefore, a danger that the planet will become two-headed: on the one hand, poor countries, suppliers of labor, and on the other, rich countries, suppliers of capital. Shouldn't Europe be the barrier to maintaining a certain balance between greater profitability and greater well-being? We must not forget that what basically makes a company function and achieve good results is human capital. To conclude, I would remind you that the third letter of the name of the EDD Group, to which I belong, stands for ""difference."" Europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to unplanned restructuring and with a view to ""all benefits,"" the voice of difference in this uniform wave of restructuring. Mr. President, last month in the United Kingdom, in a region bordering my own, the Michelin Group announced a significant number of layoffs at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to the company's restructuring and increased global competition in the global tire market. I, like all Members here, regret this job loss. Similarly, I regret the announcement made by Goodyear that prompted this resolution. But I certainly doubt that a European Employment Council would have been able to change this corporate decision. This House is very good at issuing resolutions and legislating, and sometimes, in this institution, we forget that Europe cannot survive alone. We need multinational companies that base their businesses on our continent. In the few months I've been here, it's been astonishing to me that while we all talk about incentivizing businesses to grow in the EU, virtually every resolution we pass encourages them to leave. At our last plenary session in Brussels, we voted on the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive and tried to make its rules retroactive, adding huge costs for European car manufacturers they couldn't have foreseen. Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, announced that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could also lead to redundancies at its Derbyshire plant."	es
And this is because this agenda is limited to just three topics that concern only two of the European Union's institutional bodies in a fragmentary way. I will not repeat them, since they are well known to all. This observation is justified on the one hand by the constant demand that is being made, sometimes very intensely, by European citizens, and on the other hand by the enormous dimensions of this great undertaking that the European Union has already embarked upon, that of enlargement. With this in mind, the new Intergovernmental Conference cannot fail to include on its agenda topics whose treatment would guarantee the regular functioning of all, and not just some, of the European Union's institutions. It should also include topics that affect daily life and are therefore obvious to the European citizen. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament, in numerous discussions and in light of the numerous reports produced to date, has openly expressed its support for the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference. At the same time, however, I request that topics be included that improve and complement the reform, and I repeat, of all the institutional bodies. But topics that directly affect European citizens should also be added. Such as health, energy, culture, transport, even tourism. On the one hand, the question of whether the agenda will be extended is still under discussion. And at this point, I would really like to emphasize the political leadership of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly committed itself before the European Parliament to making every effort in this direction. On the other hand, the question of increasing the number of topics for discussion in no way diminishes the importance that each member country attaches to the Intergovernmental Conference because the institutional framework on the basis of which Europe will evolve in the future is the fundamental principle of European integration and is therefore of supreme national importance for each member country of the Union. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having taken note of this information, I ask the House to approve the opinion that Mr Leinen and I have presented to you, so that the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin on 14 February and so that our two representatives at it, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can, in accordance with the opinion of the European Parliament, undertake the difficult work that awaits them. The same applies to the European Commission, and I would like once again to thank Commissioner Barnier for his contacts with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he has presented to us. Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party is not satisfied with the outcome of the Helsinki European Council. We felt that the agenda was relatively inadequate, as we were basing our decision on the logic of the Treaty and, more specifically, on the Protocol on the institutions of the Union. In Helsinki, governments agreed that as long as the Union consisted of fewer than 21 states, a de minimis reform would suffice, but that with more members, a thorough reform would be required.	fr
Ladies and gentlemen, this decade can be, I would even say must be, the decade of Europe. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, dear colleagues, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we are pleased that the Commission has tabled a document to prepare for it. We also welcome the conclusions we find in this document. Furthermore, we broadly welcome the speech just delivered by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi. The conclusions of the document indicate that the five-year term of the Prodi Commission will be a period of major changes. Europe will progress in its integration and the Union will, at the same time, embark on a phase of enlargement that will ultimately lead to the reunification of our continent. This is ambitious, one might even say prophetic. Mr President of the Commission, we hope that it succeeds in this way. But we also say that the present is the foundation of the future and that we can only shape the future if we prove ourselves in the present. I say this seriously and I say it with concern! I am thus addressing the ongoing discussion on the conflicts that are currently dividing the European Union. We, the European Union, are a Community! We belong together, even when there are problems. This is the time not to isolate but to unite and complete, together, this work of uniting Europe! Mr President of the Commission, in recent weeks, you have represented and defended the European Parliament on several occasions. You have considered yourself the guardian of the Treaties – which is your role. We expressly express our respect, our gratitude and our support for this, including for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria to which you referred. (Applause) Mr President of the Commission, we agree with you on the objectives: in the 21st century, we want a strong, capable, and democratic Europe. A Europe that defends its values of human dignity, democracy, and the rule of law, both internally and externally, and at the same time looks after its interests in the world with dignity, patience, and convincing confidence. The message of Europe, of the European Union, to the world cannot be arrogance or even European nationalism; no; it must rather be one of cooperation, partnership, and peaceful development. Globalization therefore represents for us the opportunity to organize this ever-closer world under the banner of peaceful competition and solidarity. Seen from this perspective, globalization presents more opportunities than dangers, more rapprochements than divisions, more mutual enrichment than limitation. But we also know that we can only meet these major challenges of globalization together, as Europeans. Globalization is not only an economic process but also a cultural process. We therefore say that we want a partnership in the world; we do not want – as some predict – a clash of cultures, a clash of civilizations; rather, we want partnership, encounter, exchange and peace.	fr
In this area, too, we see that the structure of the economy differs from one country to another, and that the paths by which the current level has been reached differ. Therefore, it is not good to implement a single policy, which would likely be full of exceptions and adaptations. It would mean that Member States would be deprived of certain tasks that are theirs for no apparent reason, and that the Brussels bureaucracy would intervene unnecessarily. It is preferable for Member States to adopt measures to promote employment themselves. They obviously understand more about this matter than the Commission. Hence my reluctance to adopt Community measures to promote employment, even when it concerns the tourism sector. It would truly upset us if, despite everything, Parliament were to attempt to achieve this objective through unofficial means by extending its powers. Mr. President, as you will understand, we cannot endorse the resolution before us in its current version. First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Viceconte for all the work he has done on this report. This is a very extensive report. We warmly welcome this report, just as we welcome the original report on which it was based, the report of the High Level Group established by the European Commission. I trust that the European Commission will not forget this. Having established it, I hope that the European Commission will effectively make use of it and therefore not allow it to languish in the corridors and become covered in dust. Tourism is essentially made up of small businesses and is therefore a very fertile area for job creation. As has already been said in this debate, three million potential jobs over the next ten years is something worth fighting for. Europe can no longer refuse the recognition—both in economic terms and in terms of political action—that the fastest-growing sector of its economy deserves for its economic and social position. We need a more dynamic vision based on tourism's contribution to job creation. We must recognize a sector that is predominantly related to cross-border activities and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating, innovative, and active approach to sustainable business development. I know the Commissioner is very interested in IT. He has convinced me of this. But his IT and tourism portfolios, in fact, fit very well together. There are several reasons why tourism is an ideal breeding ground for integrating job creation strategies. Let's look at some of these reasons. The importance of tourism to the economy and its growth potential is evident. Various sectors of the population are employed by the tourism industry, especially the most vulnerable groups such as young people, women, and unskilled workers. I am not saying that it is not necessary to improve skills within the sector—of course we must—but let's consolidate jobs first. The availability of unskilled, temporary, and seasonal labor is very important in some economic areas of the Community.	es
I will limit myself to mentioning just a few: our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to achieve synergies between aid and economic cooperation; our neutrality and defense of the Community's supreme interests; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to tackle relatively large challenges compared to what each of our Member States can normally do. I will not forget our presence on the ground: fundamentally, it seems to me that the greatest value we represent is the fact that, being a successful regional cooperation enterprise, we can be seen as a neutral and desired partner for this experiment worldwide; that is something no one, apart from us, can claim. It is essential that Community policy be more effective and that we develop a more cooperative strategic framework. This is what the Commission must address, and to this end, it will have to prepare a proposal in the form of a general policy statement in the coming months. We will launch a broad and open consultation process to gather the views of all the various stakeholders. I consider this process almost as important as its content, and we will allocate all our resources to active participation and invite everyone to participate with us. At the same time, we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and of clarifying and openly highlighting the real or imagined problems we encounter in this regard. This will be an ongoing process that I view as a kind of permanent quality control effort, and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Mr. Amado, as well as Mr. Nielson, for their words. I am also pleased that Mr. Amado referred to the EDF. The problem is not here, in this Parliament, nor in the Commission; the Council must take the necessary steps to establish the EDF budget, therefore, this sermon really must be delivered in the Council. Mr. President, I also thank Mr. Nielson. The new Lomé Convention has been referred to at length, but this is certainly not the subject of this morning's meeting. We wanted to talk about coherence. That is the issue. Since the early 1990s, the European Parliament, the Commission, and the Council of Ministers have recognized that European policy coherence is not operating adequately, especially in the area of development policy and other Union policies. Attention has been called for this problem on several occasions: in 1992, 1995, and 1997. All the examples are included in the resolution before us. I myself have raised questions on this issue for years. The obligation for coherence was even introduced into the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997. Furthermore, in 1998 it was agreed that the European Commission would prepare an annual report reflecting the progress made. But what have we seen since then? Fine words, even today, but no report. It's too ridiculous to explain.	es
"To put it bluntly, a hierarchy of oppression has been created. And as long as citizens are not equal before the law, this inequality will lead to discrimination and the erosion of human rights. In our enlargement process within the EU, we have rightly placed great emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities. We must not waver from this commitment. But we must also look in the mirror and recognize our own imperfections. Yes, conventions have been signed, but action is needed. I would recommend continuous audits of human rights practices, constant vigilance, not only outside our borders but also within them. That is why I would welcome an annual report from all Member States, requiring them to report any complaints against them and the action taken, because what happens in one Member State affects us all. What happens in another part of the world affects us all. The case of Pinochet in Chile is as important as that of Haider in Austria. Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked. Human rights do not exist in isolation; they are linked to our development policies, our economic policies, our internal affairs policies; in fact, they are at the very heart of our democratic functions. I will repeat what Mr. Patten said: we must engage, we must inform, educate, and thereby effect real and lasting change. Mr. President, ""Europe represents ideals, values, and principles. We must honor the intellectual history of Europe. We must rehabilitate the values that unite it. Intellectual life began in Europe and spread throughout the world. We must live with our conscience."" These were the words of Czech President Vaclav Havel in this Chamber three hours ago. In a particularly edifying speech, marked by human knowledge, wisdom, historical knowledge, and an understanding of Europe's intellectual and Christian heritage, he indicated the sources of inspiration from which our work in favor of human dignity and human rights must draw. We must be grateful that our Europe has heads of state of the caliber of Mr. Vaclav Havel. I would like to raise two subjects. First, that of civil society. Mr. Vaclav Havel said earlier that the communist regimes of Eastern Europe were methodically destroying civil society: popular movements, churches, and independent trade unions. This is what is happening in China, with the Falun Gong movement and the Catholic and Protestant churches. It is also what is happening to Tibetan Lamaism. We must never forget to defend civil society. I would also like to raise the issue of the death penalty. The EU, like my own country, Sweden, is founded on a worldview centered on human equality and the unique and inviolable value of human existence. Based on this principle, humankind must always be given a chance to reconsider its actions. This must be said to the US government, the Russian government, and the Chinese government. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Commissioner, in my view, the approach of the EU Member States in Geneva should aim to prioritize the situations in Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, and China."	fr
"Hence, this first agreement with Macedonia is crucial, as it will be the model. I am convinced that the other four countries are asking themselves: what will happen? What will the European Union do with Macedonia? Will it do the same with us? Since this model constitutes the first step forward, it is so important. Macedonia is also a model in another sense. The rapporteur has already pointed this out very clearly: the issue of interethnic relations. There is no need for us to reproduce it here in an overly idealistic way. During the presidential elections, it seemed that it was not working at all that well, but compared to the rest of the region, we could talk about the Macedonian model. Much would be gained if we managed to export this model, together with the Macedonians, to the rest of the Western Balkans. This prototype also applies to regional cooperation. I fully agree with the rapporteur that a balance must be struck between, on the one hand, promoting regional cooperation and, on the other, maintaining openness to Bulgaria and Greece, and not closing it off. Mr. President, Commissioner, if we take this first step well, much will have been gained. If we botch it, much more will have been lost. Mr. President, let me state first of all that I have no problem approving, in principle, this well-prepared report. I simply want to draw attention to an issue that, in my opinion, has not been addressed in the report and which constitutes a serious problem for Macedonia and for the effectiveness of the financial and other aid provided by the EU. I am speaking of the sanctions against Yugoslavia. So that there are no misunderstandings: I, too, believe it necessary to decisively address the problem of the Milosevic regime. But, first of all, these sanctions have a broad and negative impact on many neighboring states, including Macedonia, which find themselves in a very difficult economic situation. Secondly, in a politically counterproductive manner, the entire Yugoslav people are being held responsible for Milosevic and his clique, thereby violating human rights. Consequently, I believe that, as stated in Amendment No. 10, the issue under discussion today should lead us to quickly end this policy of sanctions. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it was not necessary to end the Kosovo conflict to conclude that, after several wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their countless negative consequences for the stability of the Balkan region, a comprehensive and lasting strategy for the entire region would be necessary to guarantee peace and stability in Southeastern Europe. This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact, adopted on June 10, 1999, in Cologne, considers the region of Southeastern Europe as a whole, but at the same time recognizes the diversity and uneven development of the various countries that comprise it. The European Union's contribution to the Stability Pact, embodied in the so-called ""Stabilization and Association Process,"" represents the development of the regional vision that the European Community developed in 1996 for the five countries of the region—Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Albania—and whose most important aspect consisted of establishing political and economic conditions designed to support the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement, which should contribute to regional stability."	es
Within the Member States, regional disparities are dangerously widening. One need only look at the data in the sixth periodic report to realise the strong acceleration in regional inequalities over the last ten years. The attention paid to the colossal problems of the Union's island areas is laughable, if not non-existent, precisely when the lack of infrastructure in terms of transport, communications and energy condemns these areas to desolation. This state of affairs is not only the fault of regional policy, but also of the economic and social policies implemented by the Union in general. Large sections of the population condemn these policies outright as dangerous and repressive. Unfortunately, the new guidelines do not mark any change of direction and there is no indication that, with their application, anything will ever change. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to speak briefly to highlight two points in the reports under consideration, which are of essential strategic importance in our vision of the Union. The first concerns the essential and central importance that we continue to attribute to economic and social cohesion. We are therefore concerned about the rumours that the importance of this objective is diminishing in the Commission's considerations. We continue to believe that economic and social cohesion is a central objective of the Union. The second is that I agree with the comments made by a colleague on the issue of the islands, and I would like to draw attention to the outermost regions. In future, we would like to see greater courage in the treatment of issues concerning the outermost regions, such as, in the case of my country, the Azores and Madeira. I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to explain to us the reasons for the delay in its report on the outermost regions, which Parliament has been waiting for a long time now. Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, also for her willingness to take on board our suggestions in the report. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to provide guidance to Member States in achieving the reform objectives in the context of programming. However, contrary to the claim to provide guidance, the Commission's recommendations on this matter are rather a catalogue of possible measures in the various policy areas. Their original purpose would be to indicate the direction and priorities. I share the rapporteur's view that the Commission document unfortunately contains insufficient recommendations to Member States to proceed with administrative simplification. I also support the calls to focus attention in the negotiations with Member States on areas such as promoting a favourable environment for labour-intensive small and medium-sized enterprises, by setting clear objectives for the creation of alternative sources of financing, including venture capital and private financing programmes, support services for new businesses as well as for new information technologies and investment in innovative sectors. I particularly support an amendment tabled by my political group to point 10, aimed at ensuring adequate participation by the private sector in the planning and implementation of projects.	it
Fourthly, given the merits of LIFE, Parliament has included in its annual budget increasing amounts earmarked for this programme, so that the approval of the proposal supported by the Council and the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of the trend. However, our concerns are not limited to the financial aspect. Climate change and water management policy are a source of great concern for European citizens and have already received much attention from this House. We therefore believe it is essential to approve our amendments Nos 5 and 6, which aim to define the concepts of sustainable management of groundwater and surface water and reduction of greenhouse gases, by including them among the objectives of LIFE-Environment. I would like to conclude by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her report and take this opportunity to inform her that, although our preference for the accompaniment of LIFE is for an advisory committee - as has been clearly demonstrated in the Committee on the Environment - we will vote in favour of her amendments on comitology because we do not wish to contribute to the implementation of the Council's proposal, which we frankly consider to be worse. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE is the most important financial instrument, the only financial instrument, in fact, that the European Union has which is exclusively intended for the environment. It must therefore absolutely meet our ambitions, ambitions which undoubtedly come at a price. The key point in the discussion with the Council will, of course, be the allocation for LIFE III. The common position provides for a package of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004, which is insufficient. The Liberal Group is in favour of increasing this sum to EUR 850 million. We will therefore support Mrs Lienemann's amendment, which points out that the funds earmarked for LIFE were not increased at the time of the last enlargement of the Union, not to mention the new round of candidate countries. The funds we are requesting do not represent a mountain of wasteful expenditure. On the contrary, they do not yet reach the levels needed to cover actual needs. A drop in the ocean, I would say, compared to Europe's structural policies. The environment definitely plays a secondary role in the European budget, although it is first and foremost an investment, an investment in natural resources, certainly, but also in employment, since it has been shown that an active environmental policy can create new jobs, as is evident from the great success achieved by LIFE: a success for NGOs, businesses, local authorities, third countries. Almost a third of the 8,500 applications received met the required conditions and around 1,300 projects received co-financing between 1992 and 1998. This is a success which, according to the precise will of this Parliament, must last over time. This is why we support Amendment No 14 which defines, in broad terms, the fourth phase of the LIFE project. When it comes to the environment, investment and ambition are realities that must exist in the long term. The future of the new generations is at stake. ? (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I may repeat what my colleagues have already said, but I think it is necessary to reiterate once again, for the benefit of the Council, what we think of LIFE.	it
I believe there is agreement that waste and residues from ships should be disposed of in ports. The logical consequence, it could not be otherwise, is the following: the number one rule for maintaining clean seas is that disposal on the high seas must no longer be profitable. That is the point, and we have discussed it in this Parliament and achieved a majority. In January, Commissioner, we had a very comprehensive debate with you on the consequences of the Erika accident and on that occasion we once again reviewed all the key points for ensuring safe ships and clean seas. The directive on port facilities for waste and cargo residues that we are currently examining also concerns precisely what can be done to make the seas cleaner. Just one figure, for information: every year, 70,000 cubic metres of waste are illegally dumped in the North Sea alone and, conversely, only a maximum of 5 to 10 percent of ships follow the correct procedure, that is, dispose of their waste in ports. Such a scandal is also unacceptable to the Council. The Council also maintains that all ports must have adequate collection facilities and must equip themselves with them. The conflict is basically only about the question of cost coverage. In the first reading, Parliament, by a large majority, maintained that the ships themselves must contribute at least 90 percent. This is the difference compared to the Council, which instead proposes an unspecified contribution, but such a contribution could also be equivalent to half a euro, which is clearly too little in this case: in this way nothing would change, there would be no economic pressure on the ships to adopt a consistent line of conduct. A flat-rate contribution to disposal is necessary for all ships, regardless of the actual use of the disposal facilities, i.e. the economic incentive to discharge into the sea must disappear. In the Baltic Sea this has been possible - some colleagues have already mentioned it - thanks to the HELMKOM Convention, which provides for a no special fee system. If it worked there, it should also work in other European seas, because it is not just the environment that is at stake, but clean water, tourism, and, crucially, alongside environmental considerations, neutrality in terms of competition is also at stake. The conditions applicable to ships in ports must be the same for everyone and only if these conditions are set together by Parliament, the Commission and the Council can neutrality of the conditions of competition for ports and ships be re-established. I believe that the credibility of the Union and especially of Parliament is also at stake. People are fed up with the hypocrisy of Europe and of Ministers in the face of disasters, as we saw in the case of the Erika. When oil spills onto the coasts, politicians and Ministers appear and get busy, each with their own bucket to clean the beaches, but when, after two weeks, a tough directive is on the agenda, the fine words of the day before are already forgotten.	it
"The nature of the Union has not changed. From the beginning, it has acted in function of a few dozen large financial and industrial groups and their lobbies. But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the European Union in order to nominate it to lead the world alongside the United States, while entering into competition and conflict with them. This new imperial policy presupposes the reorganisation of European and national institutions, the consolidation of state power, greater competition, the establishment of a European army and the redistribution of financial resources. That we still dare to invoke the defence of a ""European social model"" is a shameful lie because the more the European Union fights the United States, the more it becomes a clone of it. We will therefore vote against these objectives because we oppose this policy both in the Chamber and on the streets. The drafting of a European Charter of Fundamental Rights would be the only glimmer of light within such a policy, but once again nothing has been planned so that the people of Europe can take charge of it by deciding democratically. We abstained from voting on the resolution for the following reasons. Firstly, the resolution does not clearly enough denounce the rather vague nature of the priorities and commitments formulated in the Commission's programme. Secondly, we believe that, in the context of defining priorities for the next five years, the main issue that the Commission must address concerns its role in the framework of interinstitutional relations within the European Union - and in this context neither the programme nor the resolution are mentioned. In our view, there is a factor that will condition the role that the Commission will play in the near future and that is linked to the return of the European political initiative by the governments of the Member States following the failure of the Santer Commission. We believe that this aspect is extremely positive, as it allows the national parliaments, on which the governments depend, to continue to claim the indispensability of their democratic mandate in the construction of Europe. The truth is that the European Parliament continues to fail to win the trust and even the interest of public opinion, which insists on not thinking in European terms, as demonstrated by the abstention rate recorded during the last elections. It is therefore necessary to strengthen the mechanisms used for cooperation between the governments of the Member States, making them more coherent, transparent and democratic. We welcome President Prodi's commitment to improving the public image of the Commission and agree that the Commission should consult with Parliament and the Council. However, we believe that the highest priority should be given to reforming the mechanisms of government cooperation, in particular through the creation of a Council of Ministers for Europe which, in concert with each other and in coordination with the other European institutions, will enable the political decisions taken within the European Councils to be transformed into concrete actions. Corrie report (A5-0032/2000) Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1999 was characterised by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation model resulting from the Lomé agreements. As early as 1994, with an initial resolution to which our colleague, Dominique Souchet, had contributed largely, the Joint Assembly had expressed alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which had contradicted the very principle of Community preference, which is essential to cooperation."	it
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report. I also fully agree with his conclusions, in which he proposes, in particular, increasing the number of assistants to the judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the Court of First Instance with its own translation service. I truly consider this necessary because, during the Legal Affairs Committee's visit to Luxembourg, we heard that, quite inevitably—as if by God's grace—the Court of Justice takes precedence over the Court of First Instance when using the joint translation service, and that, as a result, important cases often cannot be adequately dealt with at the Court of First Instance. However, I also believe that the reforms must go further than what we are about to adopt here. I think, for example, that it is worth considering, in areas where quasi-judicial panels already make decisions in advance—I'm just citing Alicante, or as is also planned for European civil service law—making the Court of First Instance the final instance, if necessary, and establishing final jurisdiction there. I also see that we probably need to do something about the European Commission's tendency to renationalize competition decisions and shift them back to the national level. It seems necessary to think about this, because these cases will then no longer end up in the Court of First Instance, but rather as references to the Court of Justice. We should consider how to deal with this situation. Perhaps there should also be the possibility of making references in competition cases to the specialized chamber of the Court of First Instance. Furthermore, we must also consider whether it is right—and we have just had cases in which Members of Parliament or political groups have sued the European Parliament—that the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over such matters, even though they actually involve constitutional issues, and these matters logically belong before the Court of Justice rather than the Court of First Instance. One final point: I also believe that OLAF requires constitutional oversight. At the moment, OLAF exists in a vacuum and can do whatever it wants. I believe it is necessary for a court to oversee OLAF. The only court that could reasonably do that would be the Court of First Instance. That, too, would be a stimulus for the further reform process. Mr President, first of all, I would like to join with those who have congratulated the rapporteur on his work. The European Union is a system based on the law. It must therefore have courts that can give effect to that law. Moreover, if the courts are unable to deal with the cases brought before them adequately and expeditiously, what happens is what Mrs de Palacio Vallelersundi has already mentioned: that is, as we all know, justice delayed becomes justice denied. The report on the Court of Justice shows that this is precisely what is happening, and it shows what steps can be taken now to contain the problem. But, as Mr Marinho has already said, more needs to be done, and that will have to wait until the Intergovernmental Conference.	de
If we had had such provisions, I repeat, the disaster would probably not have occurred. This is why we believe that we must review the applicable texts and, in particular, the 1992 protocol which exempted charterers, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from all liability. However, if the charterer is exempt, he is of course less involved in the controls carried out by the oil companies. We must therefore review the regulations and I thank you, Madam Commissioner, for pointing out all the current inadequacies of the European provisions. Furthermore, we must above all, as you said, strengthen controls: those of the flag State, those of the classification societies. You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognized by the Commission. Under what conditions is this recognition carried out? What are the guarantees of reliability? You will send a mission. We await the results with great interest. We must also strengthen controls by maritime authorities, controls in European ports. It should be remembered that there is a Paris Memorandum, which requires a minimum level of control: a quarter of the boats calling at European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned. This obligation is not respected, either in France or in many other European countries. Why? What conclusions has the Commission already drawn from this or is preparing to draw from it? It also seems to me necessary to strengthen the control imposed on the charterer, in this case the oil tanker. If its financial liability is involved, this control will undoubtedly be more stringent. Finally, coordination between maritime authorities is necessary to achieve a sort of European system similar to the coast guards that monitor the coasts of the United States. I would first like to thank my colleagues responsible for the environment in my group for addressing this particular problem jointly with their team responsible for transport. This disaster affects both transport and the environment and is not confined to one area. We find ourselves once again in Parliament debating yet another maritime disaster. I could list the disasters that have struck this sector during my ten years in Parliament, but I only have three minutes. There is no doubt that it is high time that the Member States, but also that paper tiger known as the International Maritime Organization, and, last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners, assume their responsibility by acting to put an end to these ecological and human tragedies that have been repeated over the years. How many Erikas do we have to endure before the established authorities provide us with a proper system of port state control that is effective throughout the European Union, not just in certain regions? How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry builds tankers with separate tanks and double hulls?	fr
The world's major financial centers would be far from devoting the proceeds of the Tobin tax to finance humanitarian interventions and UN benefits, without being able to derive any tangible benefit. As regards the function of the Tobin tax to prevent future currency crises, it must be remembered that it would not eliminate the causes of overvaluation. That is why, as Mr Karas stated, this task should be entrusted to the political bodies responsible for the overvaluation of certain currencies compared to their real value; also, subject to the adoption of control measures for currency imports and exports. Otherwise, this would not be feasible. Despite the apparent wisdom of the Tobin tax, it hides several obstacles and, personally, I think it will be difficult to find an agreement on its introduction. It must be remembered that today money is above all information and that in the future the world economy will increasingly be based on it and on human resources. That is why the uninterrupted flow of capital between the world's financial centers is not just a mere speculative character without any connection to the real economy. If, with fiscal instruments such as the Tobin tax, we try to influence this feedback mechanism, which gives operators freedom of choice, the economic consequences would be extremely high and higher than the revenues that could be obtained from the tax. Having said that, I repeat what Mr Karas rightly said, namely that our group is firmly opposed to the adoption of the Tobin tax. Madam President, I speak as a supporter of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders. It seems to me completely self-evident that action is necessary. Over the past 30 years, the volume of currency transactions has increased 83-fold: firstly, the total global reserves of all central banks barely amount to the value of the operations carried out in a single day on the foreign exchange market; secondly, the annual global exchange of real goods and services amounts to just three and a half days out of 350 of foreign exchange market activity, that is to say, 1 percent of capital movements are for the exchange of goods and services and 99 percent are for speculation. The size, unpredictability and irrationality of global foreign exchange markets have made it increasingly difficult to manage national and regional economies. Computer-controlled trading programs have turned a blip into an avalanche, sweeping away jobs, lives and businesses around the world. The only arguments against it are: first, the tax would undermine the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a bit fanciful in light of the speculative follies we have seen destroying jobs around the world, in East Asia, Europe and Latin America. Chirac has described those engaged in such operations as the AIDS virus of the world economy. It is necessary to throw some sand into the cogs of currency speculators, stockbrokers and financial operators. Obviously this cannot be done in one country or within one currency zone, but it could be done internationally with global cooperation.	it
On the contrary, we are extremely encouraged by the extremely positive and constructive reactions expressed during the consultation period last month, and I therefore think that, despite a possible slight delay in the design and implementation of the reforms, the understanding and commitment generated by the consultations we have diligently conducted will contribute to vigorous implementation. I would like to see matters carried out more quickly, but it is better to do things according to the rules. Madam President, we admire Mr Kinnock's thinking and realism. While he paints a picture of a well-functioning, efficient administration, he also points out the difficulties that will arise, which are already foreseeable. Mr Prodi has said that the Commission will delegate certain tasks. The political priorities must therefore already have been set out. But surely it is more important to first set out what you intend to do before getting rid of certain things. I can imagine that otherwise you will antagonize a lot of people. Enlargement – I mean the enlargement of the Union – is one of the major challenges. I would also like to point out that maintaining peace will require far greater effort to engage many more people in this area. We must move away from the rather bureaucratic approach currently practised, for example, in all development cooperation and resolutely pursue cooperation for peace. Can Mr Kinnock say what he expects from the Council and from Parliament regarding the timing of such priorities? I thank Mrs Maes not only for her comments just made, but above all for the tireless commitment to change that she has shown since becoming a Member of Parliament. I would like to assure her that we have no motivation whatsoever to delegate matters; we are concentrating on key tasks and priorities, not in order to avoid any obligations, but in order to provide an absolute guarantee that we can fully meet the most important obligations placed on us. Among those obligations, surely—and here I agree with Mrs Maes—is the preparation of an effective, smooth, and trouble-free enlargement that works for the mutual benefit of both the people of the acceding countries and the citizens of the existing Union. Being able to guarantee that we can play this absolutely vital role as a catalyst for enlargement with the greatest possible effectiveness is one of the reasons for ensuring that we focus most conscientiously and rigorously on our priorities. I would also say to her that the mechanisms for strategic planning and programming made possible by activity-based management, which we intend to introduce, may seem terribly dry and devoid of any shred of idealism. However, having been raised to believe that the triumph of ideals must be organized, I may be in a position to ask her to understand and support our mechanistic views on this, as they concern the great and central concerns of the Union and its enlargement. I hope that, given the level of cooperation and partnership we have with the Council and Parliament on all matters relating to this policy, we will not only be able to implement policy developments promptly and as effectively as possible, but will also be able to act in a coordinated manner at the right time, thereby achieving the greatest possible benefit for the Union.	de
We also need stricter criteria for interpreting monitoring results. The most important parts of Parliament's Amendments 25 and 73 can therefore be accepted in principle. The new definition contained in Amendment 72, however, is too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose. I would propose that Amendment 92 be incorporated into a broader solution. Amendment 71 does not take into account seasonal variations and annual changes in groundwater levels. The proposal therefore cannot be accepted. The Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to establish standards that ensure that the least intensive water purification treatment possible is sufficient to produce quality drinking water from surface water. Instead, we prefer an annex to the measures required under Article 11 to encourage action in this area. The status required under this proposal must ensure that the requirements for good-quality surface water are met. This part of Amendment 41 cannot therefore be accepted. The Commission appreciates Parliament's efforts to ensure that the so-called combined approach is given a central role. Amendments 22 and 47 define this approach and its scope, which the Commission can support in principle. To achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality, however, we want to reword Amendment 47 and add a de minimis provision. Water transfers are already included in the controls, but an explicit mention makes the text clearer. This part of Amendments 49 and 87 can therefore be accepted. It is not necessary, however, to set the condition that all measures to steer demand be taken. The proposal already establishes that water abstraction must be carried out in accordance with the ecological use of a river basin. These parts of Amendments 49 and 87 cannot therefore be accepted. The Commission approves Amendment 76, which implies that radioactive substances are explicitly included in the proposal. In summary, the Commission can adopt 72 amendments in full, in part or in principle. The following amendments cannot be accepted: 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 71, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 90, 91, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 103, 106, 107. In conclusion, I would like to say that I welcome Parliament's efforts to resolve the issues on which the Council's opinion differs. Significant progress has been made and the constructive tone of the discussions creates an excellent working climate for future negotiations. The number of obstacles remains the same, but I am confident that at the pace of legislative work, we will achieve our common goals of developing a water policy of which we can be proud. A firm decision by Parliament will go a long way towards establishing an ambitious European water policy for the next three decades. I would like to hear the Commissioner's views on Amendment 45.	fr
"Now, and I would like to say this to the Netherlands, the negotiations on this took place at an earlier stage. The result is a 30% increase, so we are not exactly unhappy about it. It is always better, of course, and I will always advocate for more money to be made available, and somewhat more quickly. However, I think this program offers good opportunities for many programs. I would like to emphasize that culture is not only supported by this fund. Culture falls not only under the Culture portfolio, but also in many other areas. Considerable financial resources are also available for culture in the Structural Funds. We must keep this in mind and take it into account accordingly. Fortunately, I sit on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and will therefore ensure that this is properly discussed. We have decided to agree that the budget is sufficient, because if it is not approved, it will be to the detriment of the citizens. I have always supported the rapporteur in this. Nevertheless, I believe it is necessary, and he has repeatedly said so, that the co-decision procedure be amended at the upcoming Intergovernmental Conference; then there would be no need for the principle of unanimity. We are entirely positive about the numerous improvements that have been made. No more megaprojects, space for cultural networks, great attention to promoting reading, translation, and translation services, which are certainly important for the smaller language areas. I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur and Ms. Reding on ""Culture 2000."" All that remains for me to say is: now we get to work. Madam President, all the previous speakers have actually already taken the words right out of my mouth. I believe there is agreement among the political groups in the European Parliament and the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, of which I am a member. It is with a heavy heart that I, too, will vote for the joint text for a decision by the Council and the European Parliament. Not because our delegation and our rapporteur and chairman, Mr Gargani, have not done an excellent job – they have put in a great deal of effort – nor because I completely disagree with Commissioner Reding's views on some points – within the margin available to her, I think she has demonstrated a truly positive attitude – but because of the Council's negative and unacceptable position. It's a disgrace! This amount, EUR 167 million for such a long period, is a disgrace for the European Union! It's truly sad: we are now forced to literally humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, forward-looking art projects and writers – yes, to humiliate them by praising one and rejecting thirty. This naturally awakens in these people the feeling that Europe is alien, dismissive, even hostile to the efforts of cultural creativity, which the European Union should actually be committed to – after all, our path is not just the euro, not just enlargement, not just geostrategic considerations. Our task is to lead the cause of European unification to cultural prosperity."	de
"The Commission communication we are examining today, which formed the basis for the discussion on which the Council took its decision in November, provides a balanced account of how we can improve the discussion and broaden our understanding of the challenges that Member States will face in social policy in the coming years, as populations age and the consequences of enlargement take hold. Many Member States already have serious social problems and are faced with significant social expenditure in their public budgets. If reforms are not introduced, we risk eroding the economic basis on which social policy is built; a strong and competitive economy is the best guarantee of good-quality social security. We are therefore pleased that these issues are on the agenda. The term ""social convergence"" is often used in discussions on social policy coordination within the EU. As Liberal MEPs, we accept the notion of social convergence, insofar as it involves the EU establishing broad common objectives that states must strive to achieve through their national social policy. It is therefore not a question of harmonization, but rather of common objectives. It is a fact that EU Member States organize their social policy in different ways. We have different traditions, different cultures, and despite many similarities, the nature and extent of social problems also diverge considerably from country to country. This is why it is important to emphasize the fact that social policy is a national prerogative. National policy is obviously subject to a number of common frameworks, whether these are the minimum social rights established by the Treaty, the guarantee of free movement of workers without them risking losing their social rights, the coordination of economies, and economic cooperation. Coordination and cooperation are elements that must be added, but convergence must be based on objectives and not on means. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Jan Andersson, for his very constructive efforts to try to reconcile different points of view and thus secure support for his report. I will vote for his report, but there are a few points that are not entirely to my liking. I do not agree with the point that calls for the Commission to intervene against so-called unfair competition between social and tax systems if such intervention is intended to hinder innovation, development and improvement in the efficiency of our social systems or if it is intended to prevent a reduction in the excessively high tax burden in many Member States. I am sceptical about the detailed regulation that might result from Commission intervention regarding the extent and quality of childcare and care arrangements for the elderly, and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty line."	fr
The question is of great importance, and I would like to know, since one could speak of a baby scam, whether the Commissioner will ensure that these funds are not withheld from the Andalusians, so that the funds that the European Union pays to Andalusia on the basis of the population register take into account these 400,000 children that Aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services. Madam President, please remember – please do not take this as an admonition – that we are dealing with strictly Community issues. I know that these are very important issues in Spain and that there are different points of view... I tell the Commissioner that Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government. Would you answer the question? As I have noticed, Madam President, you have a strong voice, and I hope it was loud enough to have been heard in Madrid. However, I realize that your words were not directed at me directly. I have replied to you. It is important to me that Structural Funds, and in particular Objective 1, go where they are needed. There are criteria that must be observed, and we know roughly what each European region should or could receive. Regardless of this—and this is no excuse, but I must comply with the general Structural Funds Regulation—I must speak with the national authorities of each country and with the government of each country. It is their responsibility to distribute the funds as objectively and fairly as possible. I need to find out first, so I told you I couldn't reply today. Since I have no information, I wrote to the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance on December 14. I am growing impatient that I have not yet received a reply, but I will send it to you as soon as I have it. I regret that the Commissioner has once again found himself drawn into a nitpicking and, in this case, passionate debate. In Spain—let me remind you all—we are in the middle of an election campaign, with 25 days to go until the elections. It is a consolation for the Commissioner that these elections are taking place in 25 days, so he will probably not be asked questions of this kind again. But I think it is important to say that Andalusia will receive 50% more under the Community framework and that Spain also holds a record for the use of the Structural Funds, which means that distribution is based strictly on the implementing rules and is managed in a decentralized manner through the regional development plans and the various Community support frameworks. In conclusion, I would like to put a specific question to the Commissioner: does he consider it necessary to amend the implementing rules for the Structural Funds, or does he consider the current distribution criteria acceptable? I find this debate very informative. I realize that there is a dimension that is not exclusively Community in nature. Regardless of this, we must accept that elections are constantly being held in all the countries of the Union.	de
"Now we are being asked to provide the legal basis for such surveillance. It is the combination of these two documents that should be examined. The requirements stipulate that the authorities have access to the facilities of all service providers, i.e., telephones, mobile phones, the internet, etc., and the current, extremely lax draft leaves the door wide open to abuse. I would also like to ask: Given that the requirements stipulate that the police have access to all service providers without exception, does that include the internal parliamentary service? Are we adopting regulations that allow the police access to our own systems for particularly base motives? Moreover, there is no threshold for serious offenses in this proposal. This leaves it wide open to abuse. Regarding the reversal of the burden of proof, something that is recognized in fundamental international law, the presumption of innocence is essential. This is not guaranteed. Neither the preamble nor the main text adequately addresses the right of defense, a fundamental principle of fundamental international rights. This issue must be taken extremely seriously. We are deeply concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate in national parliaments or elsewhere, and without the involvement of civil liberties organizations from across Europe, which are extremely concerned about these developments. Mr President, I am neither a member of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, nor am I a lawyer, but like almost all my colleagues, I understand how necessary it is for there to be, alongside the single economic area in Europe, a corresponding single area of justice, freedom, and security. In this respect, issues of judicial cooperation in criminal matters are certainly important. What have I realized after reading the relevant texts? I have realized that, given all the contradictions, the conflicting views on what Europe actually is, given the diversity of judicial systems, which not only creates confusion and inefficiency but also leads to downright dangerous situations, it is risky to rely on Council regulations. This applies, for example, to Article 18, to which many colleagues have referred, and according to which any country – any large country, if you like – any country that has the technical means, can monitor the telecommunications traffic of another country without the consent of the country concerned being required. I think the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur, Mr Di Pietro, have presented an extremely interesting report. Unfortunately, Mr Di Pietro was unable to explain the well-founded reasons for this in his five minutes – and thus very short – speaking time. In any case, it is about protecting the rights of countries, defendants, and citizens. In my opinion, this approach should be pursued in more depth and with greater courage. However, I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that in this context, criminal law sets confusing, even schizophrenic, framework conditions. A young person, a student or pupil, who smokes a hashish cigarette is subjected to educational intervention in one country; in another, he is treated as a criminal and placed in the ""schools of crime,"" namely reformatories and prisons."	de
Perhaps it is no coincidence that there is no one here among the conservatives, because what has been defended here as market freedom has nothing to do with the worthy principles of the social market economy that have brought us so much well-being in Western Europe over the past decades. For if we continue the path—and this is the ideology—of declaring financial markets sacrosanct and even asserting that any intervention in their functioning is opposed to progress and economic growth, we will be on the wrong path, and this could take on truly dangerous dimensions. Owners of cash assets are currently accumulating gigantic assets that are in turn urgently needed to be reinvested. We are facing asset inflation on a global scale. Thus, speculative bubbles are continually emerging in the financial markets, causing growing economic instability, which in turn endangers the entire economy. It is precisely small and medium-sized businesses and many workers who suffer the consequences. It is possible to oppose this. The least that should be done to achieve this is to finally carry out in-depth studies on the subject, not only by the Commission but also by renowned economic institutes throughout Europe. This is also feasible. And finally, the wolf should not be left to guard the sheep. It is not true that the Tobin tax is not technically feasible. It is possible in the computer age. It cannot be ignored that tax havens are often nothing more than the hard drives of large European banks here among us. In short: we cannot allow real capital and financial capital to become so far apart, otherwise, we will find ourselves facing a situation we have already experienced several times in the last century on this continent and which has led to major catastrophes. Madam President, distinguished colleagues, let us tax capital speculation, for this will have unprecedented consequences. This tax would affect those who should be taxed: the speculators. Who defends these speculators, while nurses and teachers pay sky-high taxes? Article 73c of the Treaty on European Union regulates the possibility of tax transaction. Those who oppose the capital tax support tax avoidance centers, tax havens, which number 62. The Union should reach a tax agreement that, in principle, could be signed by any country. The moderate Tobin tax would not cause major tax evasion problems. The claim that if not everyone applies the tax, nothing can be achieved in this area is curious. The European Union was founded thanks to the push of a few countries, and you can see what we have become today. In reality, the biggest problem is political: the goal is not to tax capital, but to raise taxes on citizens. The capital tax would politicize the undemocratic and powerful global financial system.	es
He described globalization as a positive process, and I agree with him. In my view, globalization has contributed to the fact that numerous countries previously excluded from world trade are now participating and integrated into the world trading system, and to my knowledge, not a single country has yet been disadvantaged by world trade. In other words, like Mr. Gasòliba i Böhm, I also view globalization as positive and believe that it has contributed to a new international division of labor, something many have striven for for years. Secondly, Mr. Gasòliba i Böhm noted that it has not yet been proven that exchange rates are stabilized by the Tobin tax. He is probably right about that. I, too, am unaware of any reasons why levying a tax on speculative currency transactions should lead to exchange rate stabilization. These are, in my view, two important observations, and that is why I have repeated them here. Furthermore, Madam President, allow me to point out that none of the speakers this evening has made any connection between the Tobin tax and the functioning of the European Union. We are all familiar with the Treaties of Rome: as we all know, one of the four fundamental freedoms enshrined in them is the free movement of capital. Madam President, I can assure Parliament that, in my daily work, I also endeavour, with my departments and my colleagues, to achieve full integration of European financial markets in order to facilitate and make capital movements as flexible as possible. In other words, by virtue of my office, I am opposed to any measures that would make international capital movements more difficult. But you can hardly expect this Commissioner to agree to a tax that would specifically impede international financial transactions. To reiterate, I believe the Tobin tax is contrary to the Treaties of Rome, and this is a weighty theoretical objection that has not been raised by any of the speakers this evening. After these, in my view, very fundamental remarks, there are now practical reservations about the Tobin tax, as expressed by Mr. Karas and other speakers. It was pointed out that the European Union—unfortunately, I must say—has not been able to agree internally on certain tax measures. This demonstrates how difficult this issue is. If we have not been able to reach agreement internally, how could we convince the other trading partners? That would be a laborious process. Mr. Jonckheer stated that this is one of the measures that could stabilize the financial markets. However, this addresses a symptom, whereas we should be addressing the causes, and in my opinion, it is better to combat the causes than to try to treat the symptoms, which is probably impossible and, as I said, certainly violates the Treaty of Rome. To eliminate these causes, one must consider the situation in the countries concerned. Can these countries boast what is known in English as good governance? Do these countries have low inflation and low interest rates? Do the markets for factors of production, including the labor market, function flexibly? This is not always the case. Therefore, when looking for the reasons for exchange rate instability, we must focus primarily on the elements of good governance.	de
The European Union voted against this proposal. The European Union's position on the approach to China in the Commission on Human Rights was reconfirmed at the General Affairs Council meeting on 21 March 1999: no European Union initiative on China or co-sponsorship of a Chinese resolution, and the European Union voted against the non-interference proposal. It is not true that, had the resolution been put to the vote, the cohesion of the European Union could have been maintained. The United States of America submitted a draft resolution on China at the fifty-sixth session of the Commission on Human Rights and is pressuring the European Union to endorse it. This circumstance has provoked strong reactions from that country: the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union to refrain from supporting the United States' initiative. This initiative is under discussion within the Union, but a decision is not expected soon. It is in the European Union's interest not to rule out any option as far as possible, in any case until after the meeting to be held on 25 February 2000 within the framework of the EU-China dialogue on human rights. In light of the changes in the composition of the Commission on Human Rights, the vote on the non-interference proposal is expected to be close. It is therefore important that this year, too, the European Union countries reach a consensus on their position regarding the possible vote on the resolution. In this context, it is important to note that the European Union consistently opposes China's requests that the human rights dialogue automatically exclude the submission of a resolution to the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. The European Union unequivocally believes that, while a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and understanding the conditions of the other party's position, dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground. If this is not the case, a resolution by the Commission on Human Rights may be necessary, possibly as the dialogue continues. The European Union also consistently reaffirms to China that the Commission on Human Rights is the appropriate forum for raising human rights issues and that, regardless of China's decision to endorse the initiative or not, it is, in any case, legitimate from that perspective. The next human rights dialogue will be held on 25 February in Lisbon and, among other things, will include seminars on legal issues and women's rights, with the expected participation of representatives from academia and civil society. The next human rights seminar will be held by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000, and in the last round of dialogue, in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the European Union's proposal for technical assistance to support the ratification process of the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, signed by the Chinese government.	es
I would also like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell them that safety is a priority for the Commission in the field of transport. And as Mr Simpson very rightly said, the process can never be taken for granted, acquired or concluded. The increase in margins, in safety guarantees in transport is a process that must continue to improve day by day. In this sense, I would also like to briefly refer to the problems of the tunnels, mentioned by Mr Rack and Mr Swoboda. In the case of Austria, this is undoubtedly a very sensitive issue, which requires an effort to see how to increase safety. In one of the serious accidents that occurred recently, the goods transported were not in themselves dangerous. The margarine and a few kilos of paint, which, in principle, did not pose any risk, caused a real catastrophe. We must therefore consider how the criteria can be further refined to ensure maximum safety. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we must consider safety in all types of transport. This week we will be holding a debate here on maritime safety, following the Erika disaster, and later this year we will have to discuss the safety objectives of air transport. But, ladies and gentlemen, safety is a priority objective of the Commission. As I will have occasion to say in the Erika debate, we are not waiting for a disaster to address the issue of safety, but we are working on it regardless of these events, which only demonstrate how urgent it is to provide an effective response to this type of problem. I would like to thank all those who have spoken, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Koch. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00. Transport of dangerous goods by road The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)] amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive which came into force on 1 January 1997 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road contains certain transitional provisions whose validity is limited and depends on the completion of certain standardisation work by CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation. Delays in the work of CEN have led to problems in the application of the abovementioned directive. In particular, the annexes have not been able to be adapted to the latest technological and industrial developments. This is, in my opinion, regrettable and forces us to intervene to remedy the failures of others. I therefore accept the proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC under discussion today. Failure by the European Union to act would force Member States to amend their national legislative provisions for a short period, namely until the CEN's work is completed, which would lead to unnecessary costs and uncertainty.	it
Mr President, I thank Mr Langen—although he is not here himself—for the work he has done to push this program through both Parliament and the Council. The project was long and difficult. The study to record the use of renewable energy sources must continue to be given great importance in the future. Although the new directive contains many positive aspects, it also has shortcomings. One example is the use of peat. Peat must not be placed in the same group as fossil fuels. If peat cannot be directly classified as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, a separate class must be defined for it, particularly in light of the environmental tax. Peat must not be measured by the same yardstick as, for example, hard coal. The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union's dependence on energy imports. Research also plays a particularly important role with regard to the next round of EU enlargement. Dependence on energy imports primarily affects Eastern European countries, whose economic structures continue to suffer from the dependence on Russian energy created during the Soviet era. The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol. We are all concerned about the environment and the future of our children. The share of renewable energy sources in total energy production must be increased, but in a sensible way. We must not forget that we will no longer be able to base the majority of our energy production on renewable energy sources for much longer. For this, we need a climate-friendly energy source: nuclear energy. Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached a result in the conciliation procedure on the Altener II programme. First of all, I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for his truly excellent work on this report. I would also like to thank the head of the delegation to the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan. As Mr Langen has just said, it was a truly tough battle in the Conciliation Committee. But we can see today that the conciliation outcome also clearly bears the European Parliament's signature. Mr. Langen pointed out that a number of Parliament's substantive points and demands were adopted, and on the most important point of conflict with the Council, the financial allocation for this multiannual program to promote renewable energy sources in the Community, we were at least able to reach agreement with the Council – as has already been said – almost halfway there. That is not satisfactory, and I want to make that very clear. But we made this compromise because it was important to us that this program be launched very quickly. After all, in the next few years, the share of renewable energy sources in energy consumption is to be doubled to at least 12%. That is the declared goal of the European Union. The Altener Program, as the only EU program with the exclusive objective of promoting renewable energy sources, truly plays a key role in this. With this new five-year program, the actions from the Altener I Program must be expanded. These include, among other things, deepening the exchange of information and experience among stakeholders in the field of renewable energy sources, expanding local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new grids and promoting existing ones. These are just a few examples.	de
"First, improve the effectiveness of its development policy. As is known, a comprehensive evaluation of development policies was carried out in 1995, and its conclusions were presented during the German Presidency. The main conclusions underscore the need for a more coherent European Union policy and a general strategic vision for the European Union in relation to development problems. Aspects relating to the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies, harmonization and simplification in the organizational framework within which the Union's cooperation policy is currently implemented, the need to make aid management more efficient and to review, in particular, its intervention mechanisms, and the need to strengthen the evaluation system and make the aid process more transparent are highlighted. A second aspect worth mentioning reinforces the need for greater complementarity between the European Union and the policies of the Member States. It is well known that a significant portion of aid is currently provided by the national policies of the Member States, which are not always complementary and not always coordinated. Much of the waste or inefficiency of aid from the European Union is due precisely to this inability to coordinate and complement each other between what each Member State is doing and what the European Union institutions propose or do. From our point of view, it is also absolutely essential that we all contribute as soon as possible to strengthening mechanisms of complementarity and coordination between the policies implemented by the Member States and those of the European Union. A third aspect worth highlighting is the strengthening and coherence of its policies, the proposed topic of debate today. First, we all agree that it is not enough to improve the conditions of aid and that it is necessary to better articulate other European Union policies so that development objectives can be achieved not only through aid and assistance, but also and above all through a more integrated view of the different policies that contribute to its consequences. As is known, a Council resolution was adopted in June 1997, and the Commission was left to present evaluation reports. The first of these, which already establishes some aspects of policy coordination, particularly in the areas of peacebuilding, food security, fisheries, and migration, was communicated to the Council in May 1999. However, as is also known, a Commission communication on coherence is expected, along with the communication on ""development policy."" It is natural that in the coming months, still during the Portuguese Presidency, this debate can be enriched in light of the contributions the Commission intends to present in this regard. Policy coherence will always be—obviously—limited, and it is natural that any contradiction between policies is also an element of balance and balancing between contradictory and conflicting interests within the Union. Only in this way is it possible to regulate any contradiction between policies."	es
"However, today I want to talk specifically about prevention. A new war is being prepared in the Gulf region. The Iraqi Government, as you know, has refused to comply with United Nations Resolution 1284, and this refusal will foreseeably lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to the denial of entry visas to the commission that is supposed to oversee the destruction of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. In that event, the United States Government and Her Britannic Majesty's Government have made it clear that they are determined to resort to military measures. My visit to Iraq and meetings with leaders and personalities of the Iraqi administration, particularly with Mr. Tarek Aziz, have convinced me that there is indeed a possibility of convincing the Iraqi Government to cooperate in the implementation of Resolution 1284. However, the responsible authorities in the Western countries must clearly state that, once the United Nations commission's mission has been successfully carried out, the embargo will be lifted and trade relations can be normalized. I would like to know what Europe and you, Mr. Solana, are doing, or what you intend to do in the near future, to avert this threat of war, which, today, can be prevented; tomorrow it may be too late. In this context, I would also like to know if it is not possible to do something to induce the Iraqi government to take a humanitarian step, that is, to provide information on the 615 missing persons in Kuwait or to release them if they were under its control. Mr. President, Mr. High Representative, Mr. Commissioner, we have all observed the particularly moderate and almost conciliatory reaction of the international community in general, and of the European Union in particular, to the war in Chechnya. Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya resembles genocide. If not, how can one describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400,000 inhabitants, the constant and excessive bombing of towns and neighborhoods where the entire civil society was found, perhaps mixed with some Chechen combatants? How should we describe the sinister filtration camps, comparable to concentration camps, where the population suffers the worst humiliations and from which healthy men, aged 15 to 65, rarely emerge alive? How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the arson attacks, the deportations, known as ""cleansing,"" which recall the worst episodes of the European Middle Ages? And what can be said of the difficult situation faced by Russian and international journalists, as well as the expulsion from the sites where the massacres take place, of humanitarian organizations and all the international commissions of inquiry? If that is Realpolitik, if we truly lack the means, then, Mr. High Representative for the CFSP, Mr. Commissioner, I address you both: let us at least use the means we have, that is, the aid programs for Russia."	es
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues face a tremendous challenge, and in the ELDR Group, we are concerned about a weakening of the drive for competition policy, both in the examination of mergers and in the supervision of restrictive methods. Delegating to national authorities is very good, but we would like to underline what Mr. von Wogau said in his report about the need for regular supervision by national authorities to ensure that there is no reduction on the European side, and we would particularly ask Commissioner Monti to reassure us that there will be random checks in this regard. Mr. President, in the limited time available to me, I would like to support the work done by all the rapporteurs and share many of the things that have been said here, particularly by my colleague Jonckheer, criticizing the excessive bundling of data and the need for transparency and a socioeconomic assessment of aid. I also share the criticism that the lack of emphasis has been placed on the development of Article 82, especially when we may witness abusive conduct in a context of market concentration. As a Member of the Basque Country, I wish to express my full support for the measures implementing due market competition. I say this in case there were any doubts about the criticisms we have directed at the Commission, in general, and at Mr. Monti, in particular, for their persecution of incentives for Basque companies and for considering them as state aid. Our disagreement persists to the extent that the Commission continues to fail to understand the nature of the general system and co-responsibility of our agreement, which means that our Basque tax rules have the same nature, basis, and purpose as the rules of the Member States of the Union, and which apply generally to all taxpayers who, by virtue of the connecting points, are subject to them. Mr. President, Commissioner, yes, we definitely need competition. We need to compete in the areas of maximizing unemployment reduction, improving healthcare, social justice, and high social standards. Furthermore—the above are criteria of political and economic competitiveness—we also need to compete, naturally, in the business economic sphere: maximum product quality, equal market access conditions for all companies, and the offering of environmentally friendly products. In other words, we must be able to combine the necessary criteria of political and economic competitiveness with those of business economics. I sometimes get the impression that, unlike what happened in my country—in the GDR—where competitiveness was prioritized above all else from a political and economic perspective, without paying attention to business competitiveness, the opposite is now very often the case, and society thinks almost exclusively in terms of business economics. I say this from my position as a businessman who is absolutely interested in this aspect. But a system cannot function like this. The only possible way is a combined approach.	es
In the postal sector, the first phase has already begun, with universal service providers embarking on a process of modernization. Rather than the process of liberalizing the sector, new technologies and logistics are the key factors influencing employment. As for the availability of the studies, a point raised by Mr. Staes and other Members, copies of each of these studies were forwarded to Parliament in September 1999. They have all been available on the Commission's website since August 1999, and the Commission is willing to provide a copy to anyone interested. The studies have been the subject of some criticism, particularly from the public postal services. I am aware that all the studies undertaken have encountered difficulties in collecting adequate data. This did not surprise us, as universal service operators do not always have detailed mail collection systems. Does this not speak volumes about management capacity? No single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of universal service is accepted by all parties. Nevertheless, Mr. Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken are sufficiently clear and precise to form the basis of the decision-making process. I finally come to three interventions on a subject I am supposed to know better than postal services: competition. Mr. Purvis, I found your remark on the call for tenders, methodologically provocative, interesting and certainly worth exploring. Mr. Medina Ortega, I am just as convinced as you that we will have to be even more vigilant after liberalization, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise, due to a lack of merger control, to private operators. This applies as much to the postal sector as to other sectors. If I may give you an example of this type of vigilance, I would cite the case of Deutsche Post, for which the Commission, following complaints and legal action, initiated a formal state aid review procedure in July. We have just received the German government's response to the comments submitted. The state aid review procedure covers the issue of cross-subsidies between monopolistic mail services and commercial courier activities, as well as the financing of Deutsche Post's recent and numerous acquisitions. I will not go into detail due to lack of time, but this perhaps illustrates, among other things, the fact that the Commission does not stop its work with the progress of liberalization. In a sense, that is where its work begins. Finally, it goes without saying, Mr. Radwan, that limits must be placed on competition, and these limits exist. If we look specifically at the issue of competition and services of general interest, when a Member State defines a public service mission, it is important to quantify the costs generated by this mission, and state aid that compensates for these costs is certainly not a violation of competition. I do not entirely agree with the terms you used, Mr Radwan, when you said that it was time to take into account the needs of citizens rather than exclusively the need for competition.	fr
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every year in Europe, nine million vehicles are sent to the scrapyard and disposed of. Although they are no longer fit for circulation, these nine million vehicles have the characteristic of being marketed and transported beyond borders, not only within the Community but also outside the Community. It is therefore correct in principle for the European Union to establish common rules on the recycling and treatment of these nine million vehicles. In our opinion, the directive has some weaknesses that Parliament would like to address and thus provide an instrument that actually points the way forward for the future. For this reason, a great many amendments have been tabled. I believe that the scope of this directive goes too far. I do not think it is necessary for vintage vehicles to be included in the directive. Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included in this directive, because such a culture of recycling is rooted in this sector that a European directive is superfluous. Even for special vehicles, I do not think it is appropriate to aim for a very high recycling rate. For special vehicles such as ambulances, I would prefer a high recovery rate. That is my main concern in this area. In my opinion, the directive correctly prescribes the obligation to demonstrate how a vehicle destined for disposal is treated in Europe. In this case, we can accept the Commission's proposals. The Member States ensure that special collection centres are set up which empty the fluids contained in the vehicles, for example by disposing of more than 32 million bottles of used oil, removing brake fluid, etc. An important aspect addressed in the directive is the question of what to do with used parts and scrap products. It cannot be ignored that the rate is an important element, but not the only one, in recycling, recovery and so on. Indeed, it should not be forgotten that, when it comes to the mobility of a vehicle, 80 percent of environmental pollution is caused by its circulation, 1 percent by its reuse and 19 percent by its construction. Therefore, percentages are not the only parameter to be applied in relation to environmental compatibility, but are only one of many parameters to be taken into account. I am of the opinion that we need clear objectives. But percentages must not become an end in themselves; we must realize the importance of the global perspective linked to the environmental pollution caused by a vehicle. I prefer to think that from a vehicle that today weighs 1,400 kilos and on average travels 200,000 kilometres, we will in future move to a car that will weigh only 1,000 kilos, but will still be able to travel 200,000 kilometres. In this way, 400 kilos less would still be transported for 200,000 kilometres. This is real progress in environmental policy, because it will lead to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions and, if I have understood the Kyoto Protocol correctly, it is the essential point. For this reason, we believe that vehicles in which optimal and demonstrably lighter construction methods are used in future will produce less CO2 and should therefore be given special preference as regards the incineration rate. It is not up to the individual Member States, but up to you, Commissioner, together with your staff, to decide whether such lightweight vehicles - many are even talking about three-litre vehicles - should be given special preference.	it
This, too, is characteristic of American society, which itself knows little about it. Americans are rightly outraged by wars and genocides in other parts of the world, but unjustly remain silent about the genocide in their own country. Today, the Dineh Indians are facing their final battle for their right to land, their right to dignity, and above all, their right to their own way of life. There are only a few of them, and their opponent is an economic power. Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the comments of my predecessors, but I would like to emphasize a few things. The Dineh belong to the North American Navajo Indians. They are excluded from society and have been fighting a struggle for survival for decades. For years they have lived in deplorable conditions. These wretched circumstances force them to submit against their will to the financial and economic pressure of the coal industry. The 1974 Relocation Act, which redivided the territory of the Navajo Reservation, authorizes the relocation of the population groups. These relocations are unacceptable, as they violate human rights in economic, social, and cultural terms. The Dineh Indians are being shuffled around like chess pieces, thus not only losing their history and the land of their ancestors, which is so vital to them, but also leaving them with no prospect of finding work or income. The Relocation Act was pushed through Congress by a group representing the coal industry. Congress never considered where the people living in the area would go or how the relocation would affect their lives. The population had no say in the matter. This is practically human trafficking. The relocation was carried out, and the Dineh were relocated to a uranium-contaminated area. Following the rupture of a dam in New Mexico in 1979, releasing 370,000 cubic meters of radioactive water and 1,100 tons of pure uranium, this place is one of the most contaminated in the world. The United States government, the coal industry, and all of us must accept our responsibility and provide an acceptable alternative: either the soil is decontaminated, or the Dineh Indians are given a place of livability and all the necessary psychological, social, cultural, and financial support is provided. The rights of the Indians must finally be respected. We therefore call for a vote in favor of this resolution: we in Europe must not allow ourselves to be intimidated by American interests, asserted by financial, religious, and industrial groups. So let's send an express message to the United States! Mr. President! There is, of course, much to criticize in Chechnya regarding human rights. According to human rights organizations, Russian soldiers have killed civilians, both elderly women and men, in Grozny, apparently even executing them. Civilians have reportedly been burned alive in bomb shelters. We insist that these human rights violations be investigated. Contrary to promises, the human rights violations committed in Alfanyurt, for example, have still not been investigated. International governmental and non-governmental organizations must be granted access to the area. On 6 December 1999, the General Affairs Council of the Union decided to send representatives of the Member States to Ingushetia to investigate the humanitarian situation, and I am, to say the least, curious to see the results.	de
"However, structurally and generally, all of us, regardless of where we are, what class we are, what race we are, what religion we are, whether at home or at work, in every sphere of society, are subordinate to men - with some individual exceptions, as it is perhaps fair to point out. In my country, Sweden, several political parties have spontaneously decided in recent years to introduce a quota of seats for women in assembly bodies. This has resulted in an increase in the presence of women in decision-making, and has in turn created space for further research. What happens when more women take an active and equal part in decision-making? The conclusion so far is that this has led to a change in political priorities, and a change in political priorities naturally also leads to a change in the types of decision-making. When we talk about gender quotas, the word ""competence"" is always automatically mentioned. But the interesting thing is that the competence requirements are rarely defined. It would seem that, today as yesterday, men systematically possess even the most undefined skills. In short, being a man would be synonymous with having greater competence. And such a view seems to me to be proof of the high level of incompetence that characterizes many of those who make decisions at the moment. In this Assembly, we have already put forward the request this year to make March 8 an international holiday. While waiting for this to become a reality, I would like to take this opportunity to wish every success to all the socialist women in the Women's World Marches that will begin on International Women's Day this year. This is an initiative of global importance, focused on violence against women and female poverty throughout the world. Finally, I would like to say, as Commissioner Patten concluded the discussion just now, that the ideal policeman would be a black grandmother. We do not have such policemen, and yet they would exist! Mr President, the role of women in politics is an important issue that deserves something better than the politically correct revival we are witnessing. There are probably few women involved in politics, although this is not necessarily due solely to the predominance of men in party apparatuses. In France, 95 percent of elected officials are municipal councilors, the vast majority of whom are not affiliated with any party. In departmental institutions, the largest party in France is the non-affiliated party, both on the right and the left. To be elected as a local councilor, you just have to want it. However, access to national responsibilities often depends on the inclusion that these mandates offer. The UEN Group advocates equal representation of men and women in the bodies of the European Union. This is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is expressed in favor of women or of supposed social minorities. Minority politics, by neglecting the profound unity of the human family to establish superficial divisions, seriously threatens the cohesion of the social body and the balance of our democratic model."	it
Question No. 3 (H-0027/00): Subject: Indictment of NATO before the International War Crimes Tribunal. Human rights organizations, such as Human Rights Watch in the USA, have already gathered considerable evidence against NATO in connection with the air strikes in Kosovo and Serbia, with a view to filing a complaint with the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. On the basis of this evidence, some of which has already been submitted to the above-mentioned court, NATO is accused of serious violations of international humanitarian law and of deliberate killings. Does the Council consider that such allegations should be left to the judgment of the International War Crimes Tribunal to be subjected to a thorough judicial investigation? If a judicial investigation into the allegations against NATO is carried out, how does the Council intend to deal with the Secretary-General/High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, who held the office of Secretary-General of NATO during the relevant period? Is there a procedure for relieving him of his duties until the charges have been investigated in court? Mr President, the question posed by Mr Alexandros Alavanos is worthy of general reflection. The Council has repeatedly expressed its conviction that the application of severe measures by NATO was necessary and justified to counter extremist and irresponsible actions that constituted a clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions. I understand that there can be different opinions about NATO's actions and their legality. Everyone is free to hold such positions. In my homeland, the various parliamentary groups held different opinions. That was the way things were and not otherwise. In any case, the Council's clear position is that the air strikes carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were carried out with the aim of ending the human catastrophe unleashed by the Belgrade regime in Kosovo. This objective was formally and comprehensively expressed by the position of the General Affairs Council on 8 April in Luxembourg. These NATO measures, it must be said, were not taken lightly, but as a last resort, when it became clear that the possibilities of a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the Belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces to expel the Kosovo Albanians from their homeland. The Honourable Member will no doubt have learned that, during her recent visit to NATO Headquarters, Prosecutor Del Ponte emphasized that the International Tribunal is obliged to investigate all accusations brought, including those made against NATO, particularly by Canadian pacifist groups. This mandatory examination will be carried out as and when such accusations are made. In any case, I have with me a statement from the Prosecutor in which she states that no investigations into NATO are currently being conducted by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and that there is no formal investigation into NATO's actions in the Kosovo conflict. All information received over the past six months, both from individuals and groups, requesting an investigation into NATO's actions during the Kosovo conflict has been registered by the Prosecutor. The Prosecutor will, of course, examine all other information and advise in due course whether there are grounds for action.	de
"Tomorrow we'll be discussing a few points. First, we know that the transport of people and goods by ship is the most environmentally friendly of all other modes of transport. At the same time, we know that ships contribute significantly to ocean pollution through garbage, cargo residues, and oil sludge. Heavy fuel oil is the fuel used by ships, and we know that 1% to 3% of this heavy fuel oil remains as oil sludge, which is traditionally dumped into the oceans. I think we agree that ships must dispose of garbage and residues in ports. And from this it follows—and there can really be no other logic: The top priority for clean seas is that illegal dumping on the high seas must no longer be profitable. That's what it's about, and that's what we've debated here by a majority. We had a very detailed debate with you in January, Commissioner, on the consequences of ""Erika."" There we summarized all the points on ship safety and clean seas. And this directive on port reception facilities for cargo residues is also about the question of how we can make the oceans cleaner. Just for your information: We know that 70,000 m3 of waste is illegally dumped into the North Sea alone every year, and conversely, we know that a maximum of 5% to 10% of ships now take the proper route, namely disposing of their waste in ports. This scandal is unacceptable from the Council's point of view, too. The Council also says that all ports must have appropriate port reception facilities and be equipped with them. The conflict now ultimately revolves around the question of how to pay. In its first reading, Parliament said by a large majority that ships must make a substantial contribution, namely at least 90%. And that is the difference to the Council, which tells us there must be a contribution. But a contribution can also be as little as half a euro, and in this case, God knows, that would be far too little. Then nothing will change. There is no economic pressure on ships to behave accordingly. What is needed is a flat-rate disposal fee for all ships, regardless of actual use of the disposal facilities. This means that the economic incentive for disposal at sea must be eliminated, which – as has already been explained here – was possible in the Baltic Sea with the HELMKOM Agreement, with the no-special-fee system. What works there must also be able to work for the rest of Europe's seas, because it's not just about the environment; it's about clean waters, it extends to tourism, and – crucially – alongside the environmental issue, it's also about competitive neutrality. All ships in ports must be able to comply with the same conditions, and only if Parliament, the Council, and the Commission work together to create these conditions will this competitive neutrality be restored for ports and ships. I think it's also about the credibility of the Union, and of Parliament in particular. I think people are tired of experiencing catastrophe hypocrisy from Europe and its ministers, as we saw with ""Erika."""	de
"There have been examples in Spain: Michelin, ABB-Alstom, and there are examples in Italy, which my colleagues will cite. There is also another disguised form of dismissal, practiced in Spain, for example, by the company Ericsson, under the name ""outsourcing"" (precise terms are avoided, such as the word ""dismissal""). Outsourcing means subcontracting services to companies, transforming stable and permanent jobs into jobs that can be terminated at any time, without union or social rights. This is, in reality, another disguised form of dismissal. Commissioner, if the European institutions believe what they say about full employment, they must take clear measures: revise the directives to ensure worker participation in these negotiations, revise the directive on collective dismissals, reduce working hours, link European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintaining jobs, and include social and labor rights clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union. Mr President, once again, this Parliament is unfortunately having to deal with the restructuring of companies in Europe. Once again, workers are threatened with job loss. This time, it is the Goodyear workers in Cisterna di Latina. As has already been mentioned, some 600 employees and just as many families are affected, who could be deprived of their only source of income in a month. These workers—despite their cooperation and professionalism, which have made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe—are in danger of being excluded from the production cycle, while the Goodyear company, after years of receiving state subsidies and Community aid, can close its doors with complete peace and tranquility. I consider this truly unfair: unfair to the workers at the Cisterna plant and unfair to all those Italian and European citizens who, albeit indirectly, through their taxes, have made it possible for Goodyear to benefit from this state aid. The European Commission and the Council must finally fully acknowledge their responsibilities in this regard, both with regard to the adoption of the common position on informing and consulting employers and with regard to Community financial aid and state aid, which should be granted only to companies that undertake to conclude long-term employment agreements. We are calling on the Commission today, above all, to protect the workers at the Goodyear plant in Cisterna and, therefore, to exert every possible pressure on the company to reach an agreement as soon as possible to ensure the continued existence and operation of the plant in Cisterna. Finally, I would like to point out, Mr President and Commissioner, that time is truly of the essence, and therefore all the measures envisaged—including those already mentioned by the Commissioner in his introductory remarks—must be implemented immediately and in a timely manner. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if European companies are to remain viable, they will undoubtedly need to adapt structurally to better meet the new challenges. We are fully aware of the current economic background, as the aim of the planned restructuring is to rationalise corporate management."	de
"If we believe in the principle of equal representation between women and men in decision-making, we must make the necessary commitments to make that principle a reality. Mr. President, at the Second International Socialist Women's Conference, held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was agreed that the essential demand, women's suffrage, should be linked to all other aspects of women's struggle and that, furthermore, as stated in the resolution, ""Women's Day must be international in character and its preparation must be thorough."" It is also worth noting that Women's Day was later banned in all countries where fascism and Nazism came to power during the interwar period. In 1910, women's suffrage was on the agenda. Today we are concerned with how women can participate in the decision-making process. Women are not a homogeneous group. Women belong to all social classes. Women have individual needs and interests. However, structurally and pervasively, regardless of where we find ourselves, regardless of class and religion, at home or at work, in all segments of society, we are subordinated to men, although it should be added that there are some individual exceptions. In recent years in my country of Sweden, many political parties have voluntarily established female quotas in representation and in the work of political assemblies. This has led to an increase in the number of women in political decision-making, which, in turn, has given rise to a new branch of research. What happens when more women participate actively and equally in political decision-making? What has been shown so far is that the agenda has changed, and when it changes, other types of decisions are also made. When people talk about gender quotas, they always automatically refer to eligibility. What's interesting is that the eligibility criteria are rarely defined. It often seems that men, today as yesterday, always have the most undefined eligibility. Being a man would therefore be equivalent to possessing the greatest aptitude. This perspective, in my opinion, is evidence of gross incompetence on the part of those who make decisions today. This year, in this House, we have requested that March 8 be made an international holiday. While we wait for this to materialize, I want to take this opportunity to wish all socialist women success in their Women's World Marches, which will begin in the spring, on International Women's Day. This is a worldwide activity that focuses on violence against women and the poverty of women around the world. Finally, as Commissioner Patten pointed out at the end of the previous debate, I want to say that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother. We don't have one, but there are some!"	es
"Europe, which has inappropriately abolished the budget line ""Natural disasters for the benefit of member countries"", must react, above all in the name of solidarity, but also in the name of its share of responsibility for this latest oil spill. In fact, citizens struggle to understand why Europe accepts what the Americans refuse and why Europe, usually so quick to legislate on environmental matters, has so far glossed over maritime safety. Europe must legislate as soon as possible and shed light on this shipwreck. But, in the meantime, the Commission must urgently mobilize European funds to help the companies affected, treat the wreck, clean the coastline, increase waste storage capacity, ensure its treatment or recycling, and establish a research program on recovering oil from the sea. Finally, the Commission must reintroduce an appropriate budget line ""Natural disasters for member countries"", allowing the affected regions to access the Structural Funds. What is the Commission's opinion on these proposals? What decisions have already been taken and what does the Commission intend to take? What follow-up has the Commission given to the resolution voted on 20 January 2000 by the European Parliament? For the time being, we have not seen any measures materialise. Mr President, echoing some of my colleagues, I would like to reiterate that the situation two and a half months after the shipwreck remains particularly critical, revealing its gravity more and more every day. The situation is dramatic from two points of view. Firstly, it is tragic from an environmental point of view. The wreck in fact still contains sixteen thousand tonnes of heavy fuel which continues to leak and, apart from these leaks, unfortunately last week we observed and recorded thirty-five acts of ecological piracy, thirty-five chemical clean-up operations, which shamefully add to this absolutely catastrophic situation. Mrs de Palacio has dwelt at length on this problem and I believe that she has implemented without delay what is absolutely necessary today, namely the establishment of European maritime law through the proposal for a directive on the maritime transport of dangerous goods. Well, from this point of view, the honourable colleague will be able to count on France's willingness to distinguish its Presidency by approving regulations that move towards greater safety. The second shock - after the first, the environmental one - is manifested on the economic level and many colleagues have reiterated this today. Shellfish farming, fishing, oyster farming, fish farming have been seriously affected because the oil spill was added, in many places, to the damage of the storm. Unfortunately, these activities have suffered terrible damage and, if on the one hand they must rebuild, on the other, perhaps more arduous task, they must regain the trust of consumers. Faced with this situation, the inhabitants of Brittany, Vendée, Charente and, moving on to other sectors, foresters, are waiting for a sign from the European Union. We cannot place this legislature under the banner of reconnecting with citizens and at the same time remain ""silent"", without concrete answers, in the face of phenomena of this kind and magnitude."	it
"We're not just asking for more oversight, or just more oversight through Europol, but the motto ""less is sometimes more"" applies to us here. If a large proportion of Europol's employees are currently occupied primarily with legal self-monitoring of data protection, and if demands are received from 15 national parliaments, this is a lot of oversight, and it's ineffective. We want less oversight and more parliamentary oversight exercised by the European Parliament without thereby hindering Europol's work. At the same time, we support the creation of a European Police Academy proposed in Tampere as a step in the right direction. Third: the expansion of Parliament's rights in this context. If the creation of such an area, in which the Union can also interfere with the fundamental rights of Union citizens, is decided solely by diplomats and bureaucrats, while Europe's elected representatives can only watch developments from the sidelines like a rabbit watches a snake's movements, then such an area will not gain the acceptance of citizens. Therefore, it is urgent that Parliament be granted codecision rights in this regard and—as I have already indicated—that the principle of democratic oversight be strengthened. We want an area of freedom, security, and law for the citizens of Europe, not against them. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I have nothing more to say to the Council. The previous speaker already explained it, using a quote of mine from the last committee meeting. Why does the Council have so much difficulty cooperating with us on the construction of the area of security, freedom, and law? This question continually preoccupies me. I will try to shed some light on this matter from my perspective. The construction of the area of security, freedom, and law moves at the intersection of the constituent elements of national sovereignty. The police and the justice system are very clear elements of statehood itself, that is, sensitive political areas for the member states. The merger of this intersection of these fields, going as far as the communitarization of these policies—that is, the delegation of powers from the national capital, from Lisbon, Berlin, or Paris, to Brussels—means ceding a portion of power. Naturally, it's very difficult to deviate from traditional forms, even if it's recognized that police cooperation is necessary and that we can only combat international crime at the European level. It's necessary to draw conclusions and say that we must then communitarize the instruments organizationally and legally. This means that the governments that must do so and that see the need for it, at the same time recognize that they themselves lose power with the implementation process. They also have a complicated European Parliament. But we have to finally resolve this. Because if we continue acting as we have done with last year's experiences, the following will happen: the debate on security and citizens' rights will be marginalized in national parliaments due to the half-national, half-European structure."	es
I have proof that this is possible. Most of you hold these debates in your own constituencies, in your own regions. In the slightly more selfish vision of the Commission, I would like this institution to have a face in the eyes of the citizens, that the men and women who make up this institution could meet the citizens as often as possible. Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation for the commitment made by Commissioner Barnier to visit the regions to explain and to listen to what the citizens have to say. I would like to invite him to my region of Yorkshire, a large European region that participates fully in the single market and is a major beneficiary of the European Structural Funds. He can come and visit us in his two capacities as Commissioner. I would like to ask you how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign. In some Member States the problem is not so much providing information to a not very well informed public, which is certainly important, but rather countering the disinformation spread by overactive anti-European organisations and movements. The Commission will have to be very vigorous in responding to the comments it receives during the campaign. Mr Corbett, thank you for your appreciation. I gladly accept your invitation and, if I understand correctly, you want me to speak not only about the reform of the European institutions but also about the Structural Funds during my visit to Yorkshire. I am ready to undertake this dual task. I forgot to mention, among other things, how much I do to intervene, as I have done, before the national parliaments, not only by speaking to their representatives here, but by going to meet them on the spot. Ten days ago I was in Westminster. As you can see, Mr Corbett, I am not afraid of difficulties. Next week I am going to the Bundestag in Berlin. I have already spoken before the French Senate. So throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will also speak directly before the national parliaments. As regards dialogue with citizens, it is not a question of propaganda or marketing or even communication. I would like the dialogue to be truly such, and that after a short film explaining objectively what is at stake in the institutional reform, those sitting here in the gallery can speak and respond freely to the microphone. As I repeat, we intend to pursue this dialogue initiative in specific or structured cooperation with the Member States, and I sincerely hope that, with your support, the governments of the Fifteen can join in, in the way they deem most appropriate and most suitable. Mr President, I would like to join Commissioner Barnier's study group with the 700 trainees, so that you will have someone to discuss with. It is not much fun to discuss the Intergovernmental Conference and transparency alone. In relation to the Intergovernmental Conference, Commissioner Barnier, in his presentation to Parliament, said that social policy is not subject to majority voting, but on page 63 I read that the fight against discrimination, the right to movement and residence - therefore the directives on residence - social security as a whole, the revision of Regulation No. 1408 and the provisions in force in the field of social policy - with some exceptions - will be subject to the qualified majority rule.	it
It is not up to you to decide this; it is up to us to do so. This, too, is linked to the newfound self-awareness of this Parliament. I would like to discuss this with you, nothing more, nothing less. We can spare ourselves any further incursions into any area whatsoever, and I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his job seriously. I ask you to respect us as Members who want to take theirs seriously, which also includes the Tobin tax. Madam President, there seems to be an omission and that, in the list of resolutions tabled, which you have just mentioned, no mention has been made of the joint compromise motion for a resolution by the PES, the Liberals, the GUE, the Greens, and Mrs Kuntz and Mr Coûteaux. Dear colleague, I take note of your statement and the existence of this joint resolution. If the Presidency's services confirm that it has been submitted, it will of course be taken into consideration. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 p.m. (The sitting adjourned at 8:14 p.m.) Adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting Mr. President, I simply wanted to disseminate some information: a terrorist attack took place this morning in Madrid. It was a car bomb. There was one death. I simply wanted, on behalf of my group, to condemn these terrorist acts once again. Thank you very much, Ms. Fraga. We have indeed been informed of this regrettable event. Murderous terrorism has unfortunately, once again, struck Spanish society; the Presidency associates itself with your intervention with particular intensity, as you will understand, since the Presidency of this sitting is also Spanish. (The minutes are adopted) Resumption of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament resumed, which was interrupted on Friday, 21 January 2000. Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will mark the second anniversary of the Cermes tragedy. Two years ago, at Cavalese in Italy, an American plane coming from the NATO base at Aviano, during a low-altitude exercise - below safety limits - cut the cables of a cable car, causing the death of more than 20 European citizens. The families of the victims, who did not feel that justice had been done since the pilot responsible did not face any punishment, expect, at the very least, rapid financial compensation from the United States. I therefore call on the President of this House and the President of the Commission to stand as guarantors, alongside the American authorities, for immediate compensation, in order to defend the rights of the victims' families. Madam, thank you and I have taken due note of your intervention. Agenda The next item is the order of business. Following the request made to me to this effect by several political groups and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents that we have just held, I propose that we schedule a debate of one and a half hours on a topical, urgent and major issue, in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, concerning the Union's reaction to the government negotiations in Austria.	fr
There is no provision for a direct transition from INTERREG II to INTERREG III, which in fact leads to uncertainties in programming and funding gaps. This is a shame, because it will certainly put good projects at risk. In implementing INTERREG, coordination and synchronisation with the other financial instruments involved must be ensured. This is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds used, but it does lead to problems. The difficulties arise above all from the annual duration of the funds, which are allocated on a project-by-project basis, for example under PHARE, whereas the contributions provided under INTERREG last for several years and are allocated on the basis of the measures taken. This will cause practical problems in the future, and I hope that this will not prevent the satisfactory implementation of INTERREG. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the LEADER Community initiative has proven to be a good instrument for stimulating innovative developments and pilot projects in and from rural areas. It is therefore certainly a good thing that this Community initiative has been maintained and reintroduced in a new form within the LEADER+ programme. The new LEADER+ programme can now be implemented throughout the entire rural area of the European Union, which offers greater possibilities for project funding. It is certainly important to ensure coordination between LEADER+ and other European Union support measures, but it is equally important to ensure coordination with other forms of promotion at national level. On the one hand, fragmentation of support measures must be avoided and, on the other, synergy effects must be exploited. From this point of view, the aim of increasing networking between areas benefiting from the LEADER programme must certainly be welcomed. The agricultural sector is one of the cornerstones of rural space and must be able to participate in the LEADER initiative; structural changes affecting agriculture can also be supported through the LEADER initiative, contributing to the creation of new jobs in rural space. The LEADER+ programme must take into account all economic interconnections in rural areas and the possibility of achieving the best result only through joint commitment. The implementation phase of LEADER must now begin. The operational programmes must be approved by the Commission as soon as possible, which means that the processing of funding requests must be practicable and efficient, and the assignment of tasks must be done as quickly as possible. Five months is foreseen, which is too long in my opinion. The timeframe should be shortened. Those who have developed and finalised a project are in a hurry to move on to the implementation phase. Although I am fully satisfied with the new look of the LEADER+ Community initiative, I would like to draw attention to an aspect that is particularly close to my heart: in its presentation, the EU Commission called for an observatory for the LEADER+ programme without going into the specifics of the implementation of this proposal. In my opinion, the following questions arise: who will work there? How will these people be selected? Above all: where will the necessary funds be found and where should such an observatory be located? I am of the opinion that the LEADER+ programme does not have a cent left to spend on additional administrative expenditure for tasks which, in themselves, should be carried out by the Commission.	it
To justify this, the upcoming enlargement of the Union is cited. This surprises me because it is a misinterpretation. A federal and centralist EU that increasingly governs the Member States actually has less chance of expanding. A flexible EU that focuses on fewer but essential areas and respects national differences and national democracies has a better chance of encompassing many more countries. Point D of the motion for a resolution calls for a more effective and transparent economic policy at EU level. However, it is impossible to discuss this without mentioning monetary union. The current text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems associated with monetary union and the central bank—this is not defensible. If we want a more democratic EU, we need to review the entire concept of EMU. The central bank must be placed under political control so that monetary policy can be guided by a political objective such as increasing employment or welfare; To achieve this, central bank transparency must be improved. The frozen and failed monetarism of the Stability Pact must be reexamined and rejected if we are to have a homogeneous policy that places the objective of well-being first. Article 56 of the Treaty, which prohibits any intervention in the free movement of capital and currency speculation, must be abolished so that dangerous currency speculation is curbed through political control. Most EU countries today have governments dominated by Social Democrats. It is remarkable that none of them are demanding a change in the direction of monetary union, now that they have the opportunity. Declaring that monetary union could be a counterweight to the globalization of capital also damages credibility. The resolution demands that the European Parliament be given greater power over the Intergovernmental Conference. It is important to emphasize, however, that the Intergovernmental Conference is and must be a conference between the Member States. It is the Parliament of the Member States, or of the people in popular votes, that must lead the development of the treaty. It is therefore out of the question for the European Parliament to be granted any formal influence in the negotiation or ratification process. Mr. President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has presented a substantially positive text for which I will vote, even if I myself had introduced several enlargement amendments. However, what has happened in recent days shows that all those who had expressed fundamental criticism of the way in which enlargement and the revision of the Treaties were organized were right. We cannot envisage a Union of twenty-eight Member States without facing the question of whether Europe shares certain principles, certain common values, whether it is reduced to a free trade economic area or whether, on the contrary, it has a greater aspiration: to be a supranational union, in aspects yet to be defined, also wishing to chart a new path of civilization and democracy in the world.	fr
"The two proposals form a coherent whole. The first broadens the range of instruments with which an ""undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities"" (UCITS) can operate. As has already been mentioned in the discussion, these bodies are to be counted among the main players in modern capital markets; their presence ensures that a greater number of ordinary investors can operate on these markets in compliance with the principle of risk spreading and protected by adequate controls. By allowing diversified forms of investment, private investors can exploit all the advantages offered by new investment techniques. The second proposal broadens the role that these important intermediary bodies can play on the capital market of the European Union with regard to the development of the investment fund sector. By allowing the creation of compartments and the provision of certain services at cross-border level, these bodies will be able to benefit from the freedoms provided for by the Treaty of Rome, which they have not been able to enjoy so far. The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and will take on board many of the ideas put forward by it. The Commission will accept amendments - I use the last numbering - Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 relating to the first proposal and Nos 23, 28 and 32 relating to the second proposal, as they represent useful clarifications and improvements. I also welcome the ideas - although they need to be formulated appropriately - contained in Amendments Nos 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20. I also support the concept of the maximum percentage of counterparty risk underlying Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45. I can also accept the idea expressed in the second paragraph of Amendment No 47. All the amendments mentioned so far relate to the first proposal. As regards the second proposal, it is possible to accept the ideas presented in Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4. 24, 25, 29, 30 and 41 and parts of Amendment 27, which contain interesting suggestions, although they need to be worded appropriately. The Commission is prepared to accept them, provided that some changes are made to their wording. I also note the request from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to codify the entire text once it has been adopted - Amendment 7 of the first proposal and Amendment 22 of the second proposal. The Commission is in favour of a codification and will endeavour to produce a codified version shortly after the adoption of the proposals, reserving its right of initiative; however, I cannot accept the current wording of the recital. The Commission also considers that some amendments tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would radically change the content of the first proposal. The Commission therefore cannot, albeit reluctantly, accept the following amendments relating to the first proposal. Amendment 7 8 is not acceptable, as the proposed generic reference to investments ""referred to in this Directive"" in place of the more precise reference to instruments ""referred to in Article 19 of the Directive"" makes implementation more difficult. Furthermore, this amendment could lead to different interpretations in Member States, which would perhaps look for instruments mentioned in other articles of the Directive."	it
"We believe that poverty and segregation are the main threats to peace and freedom. Although I agree with what my party colleagues have said and with the spirit of their document, I would like to draw attention to two shortcomings that must be corrected in the future. The first concerns women, gender, or women's rights. You referred to women's contribution to increasing production and growth. This is important, but equal opportunities between men and women are not only necessary for productivity but also for democracy in our societies. It is therefore surprising that the words ""equal opportunities,"" ""gender,"" or ""women"" do not appear in ""Shaping the New Europe."" In your speech, you referred to women, but they are not mentioned among the strategic objectives. Is this due, Commissioner, to the fact that mainstreaming is already so established in the Commission that it is unnecessary to mention women? How do you explain this absence of women? The EU must not become a Union with a male face. My second question concerns Africa. Africa is also not mentioned in Shaping the New Europe, but all the other continents are. Africa is home to the largest number of refugees, the greatest poverty in the world, and a cruel AIDS epidemic. I know that Commissioner Nielson and others are doing good work, but the entire Commission, including its strategic objectives, needs to pay greater attention to this continent. Finally, I would like to welcome the Commission's declaration, as it states, for the first time, that the EU is prepared unilaterally to take measures to facilitate developing countries' access to our markets. My question is: when will this become concrete? Madam President, Mr. President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a fundamental document for the future and destiny of Europe. However, among all these aspects, two, closely linked, stand out in particular: peace and stability in Europe and beyond. These are objectives that must be pursued as a priority. We have all shared this idea for some time, but we must also clearly state that these objectives cannot be achieved without enlargement, even though this may entail costs. Today, we must choose for the coming decades between a Europe that is perhaps less wealthy but a beacon of peace and civilization for the entire planet, and a Europe that is perhaps more opulent, but without prophecies. However, these goals can only be achieved if the Intergovernmental Conference, which will conclude this year, launches a constitutional reform that grants adequate and real powers to the Commission, which can no longer be the mere executor of Council decisions or Parliament's codecisions, but must play the role of true government of Europe. The first advocate of this reform should be Parliament if it truly wants to expand its role as interpreter of the will of the European people and acquire the importance that is characteristic of a truly democratic and strongly integrated Union."	es
"In light of the events of recent days, one might wonder what the point of these intergovernmental conferences and these Treaty amendments will be, when the Heads of State and Government - in reality, the European Council - take a position in relation to a sovereign Member State by intervening in that Member State's democratic process. Everyone is free to have their own opinions about Mr. Haider - personally, I consider him a very dangerous political figure - but it is not our place to intervene in the democratic process of a sovereign and friendly country. At the intergovernmental conferences and when we review the Treaty amendments, we must take into account the fact that the EU is evolving every day, including, as we have just seen, in ways that are contrary to the Treaty. I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency to this chamber this afternoon. February 14 will see the launch of the IGC, which will be completed by the end of the year 2000. The task is enormous, but it can be accomplished. I think there is general agreement among all the groups here this afternoon that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the reform needed to prepare Europe for enlargement. In other words, we must go beyond the important ""Amsterdam holdovers."" These include the extension of qualified majority voting—we accept this in my country, except in areas relating to taxation—the reweighting of voting in the Council to favor the larger states, and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe. On the last point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to appoint a full and non-discriminatory member of the Commission, regardless of the number of Member States that join Europe. We are willing to consider a reweighting of votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States agree that each Member State should have a full and non-discriminatory member of the Commission. When I raise this particular point, I know that I am speaking on behalf of a large number of smaller states. During the IGC, we should also be debating the possible division of the Treaties into two parts: a policy area and a constitutional area. We are prepared to accept this division if it does not limit the control that the smaller Member States had in the renegotiation of all the Treaty policies. In other words, if we are not fully represented in the Commission, we will not contribute to the political discussions. We are therefore following this whole issue very closely. We welcome the Charter of Fundamental Rights and look forward to seeing its contents. Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam set the number of Members of the European Parliament at 700, and we must debate in Parliament how these 700 seats will be distributed within the enlarged Europe. Mr President, I strongly recommend the adoption of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution. This clearly expresses not only our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda, but also our desire to see the Intergovernmental Conference held as soon as possible."	fr

Mr President, before starting the debate on Kosovo or Mitrovica, I would like to express to you the sense of disappointment that I feel. In fact, this is not the first time that we have spoken about Kosovo. We have already adopted resolutions, but most of the time they have been a waste of time, they have had no effect. I appreciate that the Commission is always present; I appreciate that Commissioner Patten is present, with the powers that fall within his remit, but I note, along with many other colleagues, that the Council is systematically absent. However, we must also work with the Council. I note the presence of a Council official who is diligently taking notes and will report back to us, but otherwise nothing happens. I urge Parliament to change its procedures and to have the Council present at the debate on topical issues, so that we can start a direct consultation. I think we must consider this possibility. I invite you to communicate my complaints to the Bureau of Parliament. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are two reasons why we have not signed this compromise resolution. First of all, one of our colleagues, known for his openness and tolerance, Mr Sakellariou - not to name names - forcefully imposed his veto and thus wanted to set himself up as the defender of your morality.	it
I believe that this is an important step, although its impact on national systems is not particularly evident. Unfortunately, to the displeasure of the rapporteur, I have to say that my group cannot accept Amendment No 3. We believe that it would be detrimental to the legal position of the creditor and to legal certainty. As regards Amendment No 6, we had tabled a similar amendment in committee. I am a little surprised when I think that you in the PSE Group did not support it at that time. We now intend to support your Amendment No 6, but, as I have already said, I wonder why you did not accept ours in committee. I also hope that transparency will be introduced and that it will be possible to make a comparison between the fastest and most effective procedures in the various States. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the Commission would like to stress that the proposal for a regulation under consideration this evening is only and above all a reformulation of the 1995 Insolvency Convention. It is well known that the Convention is the result of many years of discussions, often difficult, often laborious, and that for this reason it represents a compromise between the principles of unity and territoriality, that is to say, between the principles underlying the different legal systems of insolvency law in force in the Member States. The awareness that the evolution of the global economic situation and, in particular, of the internal market may make it necessary to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings, which often have a cross-border nature, fully justifies the fact that the European Union, as such, should equip itself with the binding legal instruments necessary to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out in compliance with a set of common structural principles and guarantee rapid execution. Unfortunately or fortunately, declarations of bankruptcy by companies will become increasingly common in our daily economic life. This will be a factor in the renewal of the business fabric that must not be blocked by the existence of slow bureaucratic procedures or obstacles that prolong the agony of no longer viable businesses. It is therefore important to try to identify a legal framework of reference that is adequate to the new needs of the globalised economy. The proposal for a regulation under consideration was not put forward by the Commission, but following a joint initiative by two Member States - Germany and Finland - under the right of initiative that they share with the Commission in this field. The Commission considers that the regulation in question does not imply any substantial change compared to the text of the Convention. As early as 1981, the Commission had expressed its position in favour of adopting the principle of unitary bankruptcy. Furthermore, this perspective had been taken up in the proposals presented by the Commission regarding a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses. Instead, the 1995 Convention ends up authorising the opening of secondary procedures, creating derogations from the general rule that the Commission would like to see accepted. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would therefore have preferred the adoption of a new text which expressly supported the thesis of unity.	it
Mr. President, Commissioner, Central Asia and the Caspian Sea area threaten to become the Balkans of the 21st century. This is precisely why the stabilization of the large states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan is so important. I would therefore like to ask you about a matter within your competence, namely, the status of the negotiations for cooperation agreements with both countries, that is, political relations. This falls within your direct competence; my other question concerns Mr. Nielsen's area of expertise, specifically environmental cooperation, particularly with regard to water and the problem of cotton monocultures, which exacerbate drought. A couple of weeks ago, at the Istanbul summit, we were able to meet and hold talks with some of the Central Asian republics. It is my fervent hope that we will strengthen our relations with them. If you wish, I can send the Honorable Member a detailed analysis of exactly where we stand in the negotiation of the partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics. Obviously, everyone will expect your prediction of what might happen in the future to be rather pessimistic. But I have no doubt that you are right to point out the strategic importance of Central Asia. I have also heard the Honorable Member speak about the Caucasus in the past. You are absolutely right to say that a Union that talks about conflict prevention would have to look at what it can do in these specific areas to ensure that in the future there is not the kind of conflict that has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and that has cost us far more than we would have been able to spend otherwise, had we taken more preventative measures if possible. Therefore, the Honorable Member's reflections on the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well realized. We are contributing to programs in the region that have some ecological impact. Our food programs are directly linked to structural reforms in the agricultural sector, as well as to the eradication of poverty. These programs themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a stronger position in these societies and does not simply consist of plundering the land. There is an ecological aspect that we must continue to prioritize. We also take note that the Member who asked the question applauded the Commissioner's response. This is not a common occurrence. Furthermore, the Commissioner did not cite any bibliography in this case. Thank you very much, Mr. Patten, for your interventions today. Question No. 35 by (H-0778/99): Subject: Greek Employment Action Plan. According to the results of the evaluation of the Employment Action Plan, Greece, along with Italy, is the main target of the Commission's observations regarding its inconsistency in terms of employment support measures and policies.	es
In one of the major accidents recently, it was not the cargo itself that was dangerous. The margarine and a few kilos of paint, which in principle posed no risk, caused a real disaster. We must therefore examine how requirements can be further optimized to ensure maximum safety. In conclusion, I would like to say that safety is a matter for all modes of transport. This week, we will be holding a debate on maritime safety following the Erika disaster, and we must also debate air safety objectives later this year. I want to stress that safety is a priority for the Commission. As I will say in the debate on the Erika, we are not waiting for a disaster to address the safety aspect; we are working on it in the margins of these events. However, these events demonstrate the urgency of an effective response to problems of this kind. I would like to thank all the speakers once again, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Koch. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. Transport of dangerous goods by road The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD) ) amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions whose validity is limited and linked to the completion of certain standardization work by CEN, the European Committee for Standardization. Delays in CEN's work are now causing problems in the application of this directive. In particular, annexes cannot be adapted in line with technical and industrial developments. I regret this, because we have to act because others have failed to do their work. In this respect, I accept the proposal under discussion today to amend Directive 94/55/EC. Failure by the European Union to act would oblige Member States to amend their national legislation for a short period, namely until the CEN's work is completed, which would cause unnecessary costs and uncertainty. The amendment to the directive on today's agenda therefore does not change the existing harmonization of the transport of dangerous goods within the Community. It merely extends transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions that are no longer applicable, and regulates the procedures for a) ad hoc transport of dangerous goods and b) the adoption of less stringent national provisions, particularly for the transport of very small quantities of dangerous goods within strictly localized areas. Thus, the amendment to the directive is entirely in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity; it gives Member States more powers. The EU Commission decides whether Member States may adopt certain of their own regulations. It is assisted in this process by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods, acting in accordance with the regulatory procedure. The modalities for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were revised by a Council Decision of June 1999.	de
"I regret the delay with which LEADER, like the other three initiatives, was submitted to Parliament and the resulting delay in the entire procedure. Finally, I am concerned about the small amount allocated, especially considering that the programme is open to all the territories of the Union and will be applied for one year longer than the previous LEADER II. I would like to thank the Commission services for their willingness and cooperation, and I would like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture for their contribution through their amendments. . (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on EQUAL is an opinion in the context of the consultation process on a new Community initiative aimed at transnational cooperation to promote new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequality in the context of the labour market. The report is quite long as it also includes the opinions of four other committees, namely those on industry, regional policy, women and home affairs. This Community initiative is the successor to two previous programmes, ""ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT"", and has a very low budget of approximately EUR 2.8 billion. It adopts a completely new approach, aiming to develop innovative employment models within the framework of transnational development partnerships at geographical or sectoral level. The clear intention is to have targeted projects developed at transnational level, projects that follow the four pillars on which the employment guidelines are based, namely employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and strengthening equal opportunities. This objective is certainly to be welcomed and is also widely supported in the European Parliament. Furthermore, EQUAL should be integrated into the national action plans for employment, i.e. its implementation should also be verifiable through the aforementioned action plans. It is an important Community initiative financed together with the other three, URBAN, LEADER and INTERREG, under the Structural Funds. In my report, I proposed reducing excessive administrative burdens and making the approach to development partnerships a little more flexible and open. I believe that technical assistance is certainly necessary, but, due to the problems that have arisen with the previous Technical Assistance Offices (TAOs), we must avoid setting up new TAOs before Parliament's resolution has been adopted, thus preventing political responsibility from being transferred to technical assistance. However, there is still a need for technical assistance. Particular attention is also paid to disseminating results and mutual learning through the dissemination of best practices and mainstreaming. I have worked to ensure that the report receives the widest possible consensus, which has led to a reduction in the number of amendments - from 100 in committee to 22 in plenary - and has also allowed for numerous possibilities for compromise. A compromise has also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers. In this regard, Madam President, in order to allow us to further finalise the details, I would ask you to vote on the EQUAL report on Wednesday instead of tomorrow."	it
Mr President, I have a question about a specific, real case where the precautionary principle could be applied. It concerns brominated flame retardants. The problem is only now coming to the fore, with high concentrations both in the environment and in the human body. Many people say that these substances pose serious risks, while others tend to downplay them. Recently, in the Council, both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission to take the initiative to ban brominated flame retardants. I therefore wonder whether such a ban is being prepared and whether such an initiative might not fit perfectly into your vision of the precautionary principle itself. Mr President, I thank Mr Sjöstedt for asking this question: the problem of brominated flame retardants is a serious problem. It was raised very recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who are asking the Commission to study the terms and indicate how to intervene. We are now looking at the issue to see what the current state of knowledge is and what can be done. I would like to point out, however, that the precautionary principle does not necessarily mean a ban or a total ban. A range of different measures can be envisaged: we cannot immediately speak of a ban. As regards brominated flame retardants now, it may be that, in time, we will come to a ban, but it is important to remember that the precautionary principle allows for the full range of possible policy interventions and measures. This is a very topical issue. The Commission will have to do its job by examining the issue thoroughly before it decides on what to do. You said that the precautionary principle should not become a disguised form of trade protectionism. Is there agreement on this point on both sides of the Atlantic? I think we will have problems, especially with hormone-treated meat and genetically modified crops. Are we sure that the Americans' interpretation of this principle coincides with ours? Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that in Montreal we signed a protocol on biological safety. There, we managed to reach an international consensus on the definition of the precautionary principle. I believe that having managed to sign that protocol represents a decisive step forward. I believe that it will set an example for future discussions on the precautionary principle and that it can serve as an example of the interpretation of that principle, which is recognized as an instrument that is both important and effective. Mr. President, I have two questions that I will try to explain as briefly as possible. My first question concerns the application of the precautionary principle. I understand that there are some uncertainties regarding its interpretation. Is it perhaps necessary to first conduct a risk assessment, including a cost-benefit analysis? If that is the case, I find it very disturbing, because the cost-benefit analysis should not have been used as a criterion for deciding whether or not to resort to the precautionary principle: it is the precautionary principle that takes precedence.	it
On the same basis, it is essential that Member States comply with their obligation to report to the Commission on aid granted to their steel undertakings, as required by Article 7 of the Code in question. The Commission suggests that Member States send these reports within two months of the end of each half-year and, in any case, on an annual basis, without being obliged to request them. Like the rapporteur, I welcomed the Commission's report even though it did not cover all aspects of aid. Although the Steel Aid Code is very clearly worded, the Commission has on several occasions authorised aid to steel undertakings which did not fall within the categories provided for in the Code. In the interests of greater fairness, the Aid Code should therefore be applied rigorously or it should be amended if the Commission wishes to authorise aid other than that which is currently legally permitted. Finally, there is the question of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty. It will be necessary to ensure that the aid system continues beyond 2002. On this point, I believe that only a Council regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and guarantee the formal prohibition of any aid not covered by the code. For all these reasons, I voted in favour of Mr Langen's report and I am now waiting for the Commission to respond to our questions and requests. (The sitting, suspended at 1.05 pm, resumes at 3.00 pm) Oil-polluted sea in France The next item on the agenda is the Commission statement on the oil-polluted sea in France. Commissioner Loyola de Palacio has the floor on behalf of the Commission and will open the debate with her speech. Mr President, I speak on behalf of the PPE/DE Group but also as a Breton elected representative, directly affected and shocked by these events. With Françoise Grossetête and the PPE/DE, we have tabled a motion for a resolution. Today, we are faced with a compromise proposal and I am delighted about that. The Erika sinking is actually a European issue because it mutilates and soils some of the most beautiful European beaches with very serious consequences for tourism, for those who carry out maritime activities, for environmental defenders and then because it involves regulation and control whose natural dimension is clearly European. Certainly a catastrophe of this magnitude would not have been possible off the American coast. Why? Because the Americans were able to learn from the Exxon Valdez catastrophe and in 1990 they drafted the Oil Pollution Act which confers greater responsibility since it can imply the liability of the charterer, is more binding and above all provides for better control through various regulations and in particular through the American Coast Guard. If we had had similar provisions, I repeat, the catastrophe would certainly not have occurred. For this reason we believe that it is necessary to review the applicable legislation and in particular the 1992 Protocol which exempted the charterers, in this case the oil company that chartered, from any liability.	it
"There is talk of pre-accession aid, and this falls under heading 7. Last year, Parliament accepted, exceptionally, that the sums earmarked for this expenditure should be included in heading 4, and in this way the two candidate countries are not being treated on an equal footing with the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which they should be, in accordance with the declarations of the Helsinki European Council. Funds must therefore be set aside in heading 7, where a revision of the financial perspective is needed. This is the crucial point. The essential issue is that the money intended for pre-accession aid for Cyprus and Malta should be taken from heading 7, and that a revision of the financial perspective should be carried out, because if the Council does not support this measure, it is effectively acting contrary to its own decisions in Helsinki in December. As regards the amount mentioned in the Brok report, EUR 130 million, I would like to say, on behalf of the Liberal Group, that we must define an amount, we must negotiate until we have established the size of the amount. The most important thing is that a multiannual programme is guaranteed and that it is included in the correct heading, so that programming can be started for Cyprus and Malta. Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the decision taken by the Helsinki European Council that the resolution of the conflict cannot be a precondition for Cyprus's accession. Strong pressure must be maintained on the Government of Cyprus, but the will of the majority of the population cannot be the object of a blackmail, of blackmail, of a part of it, also because we express serious doubts about the representativeness of the government of that part of the island. It is clear that the window of opportunity - the ""janela de oportunidades"", mentioned by the Presidency - must be exploited to the full. But we are also convinced that, although Turkish-Greek relations have improved, this cannot be enough. The solution to the conflict in Cyprus depends above all on improving relations between the two communities, with a view to the establishment - hopefully not too far away - of a federation. In particular, we must work to resolve the issue of establishing effective freedom of movement, the problem of demilitarisation and the disarmament of the island. The European Union must more decisively assume, beyond financial support - which is certainly important - an active role as guarantor and promoter of contacts between the two communities, by establishing confidence-building forums and programmes. I would like to say that at this moment I greatly miss, within the European Parliament, Alex Langer, who was a builder of peace and an example for all of us of how to build coexistence between peoples. Mr President, the evocation of dialogue between the two Cypriot factions under the aegis of the UN reminds us that 26 years after the invasion of the island by the Turkish army, from the occupation of almost 40 percent of the territory with 35 000 soldiers and heavy military vehicles, the settlement of over 50 000 settlers continues in total violation of the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions."	it
"Now, for this to actually happen, it is essential that it remains a public service. Only in this way can we guarantee that the network, from collection to delivery, remains integral, that it cannot be fragmented or used only in part, according to agreements made with postal service operators. But, in the meantime, we know that the Commission, following the directive on common rules for Community postal services, commissioned studies, the results of which have not been forwarded to the European Parliament, according to which the impacts of implementing this directive are unknown, either in terms of the service offered to citizens or from the point of view of current European postal operators, both in terms of economic aspects and employment. Therefore, in our opinion, the entire process of implementing the directive, including its timetable, should be interrupted. And any change in the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications, always keeping in mind the objective of guaranteeing a high-quality public service, the maintenance of current public operators and existing jobs. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fundamentally support this proposal while starting by asking whether what the previous speaker said - namely, that we need, on the one hand, a competitive, innovative high-quality service and, on the other hand, that this service must be a public service - is not a contradiction in itself. I think we have a differentiated approach here. European policy has liberalized monopoly markets - energy, telecommunications and air navigation - and the consumer has always been the focus. The objective was precisely to offer a better service, and it is also the user who must be at the center of the liberalization of the postal service. I believe that the consumer can decide for himself and define what he needs. For this, it needs no government, no parliament, and it needs no Commission either! The postal market is following behind from afar, and unfortunately, we have wasted precious time. I think we should also give the postal service the chance to respond to new developments. I refer here to the very good intervention by my colleague Mr. Rübig, who also spoke here about e-commerce. This development will happen very quickly and will bring new demands for the various companies in our society, demands that must be met very quickly and very flexibly. I believe that a liberalized market accelerates this development more than a less liberalized market. Furthermore, there is also the opportunity to present European policy in a positive light. We must also seize this opportunity because citizens are always asking the question ""why"" Europe is there. These are the areas where citizens can clearly see the usefulness of Europe. But I am also pleased that the Competition Commissioner, Mr Monti, is here in person today, because he is pursuing an excellent policy. And I would like to touch on an area where, in my opinion, Parliament and the Commission must, and this is also evident from this debate, consider whether to draw a line on competition. We approve of competition as an element of the social market economy - we do so also because we want to make this economic system as good as possible."	fr
I am referring in particular to the Structural Instrument for Pre-Accession (SSPA), the implementation of which I will be responsible for in the coming weeks. Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, we have only just launched the new programming and we are already together reflecting on the impact of enlargement of the Union on our structural policy. The sixth periodic report, on which, Mr Berend, you have expressed a broadly positive opinion, provides a good basis for reflection for us and for me. I thank you sincerely for your contribution to the reflection on future orientations and also for the good application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006. Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting The minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed. Are there any objections? Mr President, in response to the invitation addressed to me yesterday afternoon by the President of Parliament, I would like to speak on behalf of my group on point 11 of the minutes of yesterday's sitting concerning the establishment of the order of business. First of all, I believe that the issue raised yesterday by the Chairman of the Socialist Group regarding the reinsertion of the discussion with the President of the Commission on the strategic objectives for the next five years into the agenda was so important to the other Members who had asked to speak briefly that their request could have been granted. I would like to make this clear, even though, with all due respect, I disagreed with the motion of the Chairman of the Socialist Group and voted against it. My second point - which I would have liked to make yesterday before the vote - is that Parliament, as other Members pointed out yesterday, can only operate truly effectively if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission. We should also have the humility to admit that if we had wanted a strategic discussion accompanied not only by a presentation and a clarification by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have organised ourselves in detail beforehand - and not waited until the week before the debate in the Chamber - so that we could debate and report our wishes to the Commission in good time. I would like us to draw a lesson from this experience: whenever in future discussions of great importance are put on the agenda between Parliament and the European Commission, all the details regarding our mutual expectations should be clarified at least a good month in advance, first between the political groups in this Parliament and then between Parliament and the Commission, so as not to find ourselves at the last moment in the unpleasant position of needlessly causing a rift in institutional relations. After having looked at the articles published in the press last Friday, I think I can say that the Commission, in the person of its President, has shown commendable moderation in commenting on the facts and I appreciate that immensely. I hope we will learn the lesson and avoid repeating a similar experience based, in my opinion, on a misinterpretation of expectations, rather than on bad faith on the part of one of the two institutions.	it
Unfortunately, as everyone recognized during the military actions in Kosovo, civilian sectors, particularly those related to infrastructure that directly affect the population, and even inhabited areas were hit during NATO air actions. This is a recognized fact; it happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war is not a clean war, it is not an exemplary war; it is the possible war. I know that it was a necessary war. It was the possible war, it was the necessary war to put an end to what was an absolutely unacceptable aggression and completely condemned by the entire international community. Mr. Deputy Speaker, regardless of the interpretation we may make after the fact - it is easy to make an after-the-fact interpretation if there had been no action - I think that, given what happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the impunity for what happened there and the continuation of that impunity, we can make a less catastrophic interpretation of NATO's military action in Kosovo. Question No. 4 of (H-0028/00): Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting the development of social, economic and political relations with Armenia, within the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999, what measures is the Council taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia? Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia? Mr President, I would like to thank the representative of the Council Presidency for his answer. I am, however, a little saddened that this is primarily seen on a bilateral level, whereas ultimately it is a triangular relationship. We provide partnership funds and have a cooperation agreement to help Armenia, and yet the aid is proving ineffective because Turkey maintains an economic blockade, so that many things cannot reach the Armenians. Negotiations are being held with Turkey with a view to its possible accession, and it is in all our interests that any state that wants to become a member of the EU also maintains friendly relations with its neighbors. Can you not exert greater influence over Turkey to facilitate peaceful developments, to give the Armenians access to the development necessary for continued cooperation? You are absolutely right, Madam, to say that we must take advantage of relations with Turkey precisely so that this country can play a constructive role in this situation and, in particular, so that it becomes part of the solution and ceases to be part of the problem. We believe that the fact that Turkey has entered a new phase of relations with the European Union and is faced with the need to respond to the European Union's positions on foreign policy and common security represents - it must be said - a test of this country's will with regard to the European Union's priorities in its relations with the outside world.	fr
We have considered this problem, can you believe it? We have considered it and are examining it very carefully, particularly thanks to the concerns you have expressed. Frankly, I do not believe that these fears are ultimately justified. The Commission's proposal gives it a central role in determining the direction of competition policy. The reform does not imply any reduction in the Commission's work, but rather a refocusing of it on the most important issues. It will lead to a gradual development of the European competition culture - I would like to emphasize this because the expression used by President Randzio-Plath, which I fully share, struck me deeply. The reform will therefore lead to a transplantation, a rooting, in the field of the European competition culture, where today various small, but not uniform, plants of different national competition cultures thrive. The fifteen national laws will gradually be abandoned to give way to a broader use of Community law that can be applied by a greater number of actors. This, I would like to emphasize, is a communitarization and not a renationalization of competition law. Consistency in application. The risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind, but I believe it should not be exaggerated. Like many other provisions of the Treaty, Articles 81(1) and 82 have, after all, been applied for decades by national authorities and judges, and it does not seem to me that this has created any major problems. In a regime of legal exception, maintaining consistency will depend first and foremost on the clarity of the substantive rules. The Commission will strive to refine the legislative framework, both through acts of general scope and through its decision-making practice. Effective conflict prevention mechanisms will also need to be established, and the White Paper contains information and consultation mechanisms. On this subject, I would like to say a few words about the idea, which I think is excellent, of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and Mr Huhne, namely the idea of monitoring enforcement. So that is the idea of monitoring enforcement. I think this idea is sound and we will probably adopt it. Although we deeply respect the work done by national competition authorities, among others, it is clear that we will scrutinize the way in which EC legislation is applied by national authorities and the courts. That is why the Commission wants to retain the right to remove a case from the hands of a national competition authority in the event that the application is not correct. This may alleviate your concerns somewhat, Mrs Peijs. (EN) To respond to Mr Evans' point about the impact on businesses, it is important to say that the cost-benefit analysis should be carried out seriously. The purpose of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to gather feedback from businesses and other sources. We have received a large number of excellent comments and contributions, which provide us with the necessary information to conduct a cost-benefit assessment for businesses. We will carefully consider all this material before preparing a legislative proposal for a new regulation.	fr
You will certainly say yes, but I would like to know from you: Do you gentlemen also know what the consequences of this are? My next question, Ms. Wallström: When will you begin to apply this in legislation, for example in chemicals legislation, for example in legislation in other areas? My final question: Will we be able to see where this has been applied in the legislation? In other words, will there be a separate sheet in every proposal stating that the precautionary principle has been reviewed and that this is the conclusion reached? Thank you very much, Ms. Roth-Behrendt, for these questions. Of course, the entire Commission shares this view. This is a joint communication prepared by the three of us – David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen, and myself – but it was also adopted unanimously in the Commission today. It received strong support from the other Commissioners and is the result of consultations with the various services within the Commission. So we have worked through this document very carefully, and I am sure that everyone will be able to explain the guidelines and principles set out in this document. I would even say that we are already using this working method on various difficult issues, such as the question of a new strategy in the field of chemicals. And I am sure that we will also make it clear when we are working with this principle. Just recently, we applied the precautionary principle in a case involving the ban on phthalates in soft PVC toys, and of course, we use it in various environmental areas. It has been used primarily in the environmental field, but also in issues of human health. So we will try to make it very clear how and when it should be applied. Mr President, Commissioner, on the relationship between science and the use of the precautionary principle, the communication states that applying the precautionary principle requires a political decision precisely when science does not yet have any evidence. This, of course, transfers a great deal of power to science. We can ask ourselves which scientists will provide this documentation and what they will defend. Since the communication also states that a sufficiently recognized minority of scientists is sufficient to apply the precautionary principle, I ask: what is the definition of a recognized minority? How do you describe it? How do you arrive at a recognized minority? Regarding the political decision, my question is: who will make this political decision? The Commission? Or the Council? To what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role? What role is intended for the scientific committees? What will the role of the food authorities you will establish be? Finally, will this decision-making be transparent and public? Those are my three questions. Yes, Mr. President, that's right. There were many difficult issues that weren't always very clear and explicit, but I want to try to answer some of the questions. Who will make the decision, who are the decision-makers? Well, that depends on who the legislators are. This is part of risk management.	de
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether, after spending a few hours working with Members of the European Parliament in this Chamber, he has had the opportunity to assess what they are worth in terms of remuneration. Mr President, since the debate on the remuneration of Members of the European Parliament is not limited to your country but also to mine, I know exactly how much the remuneration of Members of the European Parliament is. I am therefore fully aware of the problem. Mr President, I would like to thank you for this answer and to table a supplementary question that is somewhat similar to the one asked by Mr Sjöstedt. We both come from Sweden. In our country, the bulk of taxes are paid in the form of local taxes, because public services are managed locally and because they are quite extensive. In Sweden, there is a problem of trust in politicians, not least in European politicians in this Parliament. In your opinion, what impact would it have on our credibility as politicians if we were granted the right to use services in our place of residence - school, health care, etc. - but without paying taxes, without contributing to them? In your opinion, how would this impact on our credibility as politicians? Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this is a question to which you are not obliged to answer because it is truly philosophical. But if you want to delve into the realm of philosophy, please! No, Mr President, philosophy does not tempt me. These are fundamental questions that have to do with the very matrix of the statute of a Member of Parliament and its role within the political system. I do not want to delve into this type of discussion, as it seems to me that it could go à prejuger, to use a French expression, of the interpretation that the Portuguese Presidency will give in the context of the negotiations on the Statute for Members, in which it is involved. I would ask you to excuse me from making any comments on this matter. Since Council Question Time is over, Questions No. 11 to No. 35 will receive a written reply. This concludes Question Time. (The sitting was suspended at 19.05 and resumed at 21.00) Address by the President of the Czech Republic, Václav Havel Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to extend, on behalf of the European Parliament, a warm welcome to the President of the Czech Republic, Václav Havel. I would also like to welcome Mrs Havel, who is in the gallery. (Applause) This is not the first time that we have welcomed you to Parliament, Mr President. You already had the opportunity to address a plenary session in Strasbourg almost six years ago, in March 1994, and many of us, who were already parliamentarians at that time, still have vivid memories of that. Indeed, immediately after the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, you spoke out in favour of strengthening European values, of creating a European ethic, of opening the Union towards the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This means that for many citizens, not only in your country, you embody that Europe of values to which we feel deeply attached.	it
"The Commission reaffirmed and reaffirms today that it shares the concerns underlying the Portuguese Presidency's declaration of 31 January. These concerns are legitimate and well-founded. There is no need to recall here the political career of Jörg Haider and his numerous public statements, which are xenophobic and racist, and therefore anti-European. The fact that a clearly extremist, racist, and xenophobic party comes to power in a Member State of the European Union cannot fail to concern the other participating States in the European project, just as it does not leave the European Commission indifferent. Secondly, the Commission reiterated and reiterates its commitment to continue exercising its duty as guarantor of the Treaties, particularly with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union. One of the important innovations of the Treaty of Amsterdam was precisely the explicit clarification of the fundamental principles that are the common heritage of the Member States and the establishment of a mechanism to monitor their compliance and to react in the event of a violation of one of these principles. The Commission thus demonstrated, in practice, its commitment to one of the basic principles—that of the rule of law—which imposes on the Commission the obligation to act within the limits established by the Treaties, and within this framework lies the declaration of 1 February. The Commission is not a State; it cannot and should not act as if it were. But to respond specifically to the honourable Member's question, I must recall that the mechanism established by Article 7(1) of the Treaty on European Union requires, for its activation, verification—I quote—""of a serious and persistent violation of the principles enshrined in Article 6."" A serious and persistent violation is—I repeat—the indispensable condition for the Commission to propose to the Council the adoption of measures against a Member State. It seems clear to me that the conditions for its application to the situation in Austria are not met. For the rest, we all hope—I don't think I'm mistaken in saying this—that these conditions of serious and persistent violation of human rights and democracy never arise, neither in relation to Austria nor in relation to any other State of the Union. But I want to assure you here today of my personal commitment and that of the Commission, as President Prodi reaffirmed this morning, to do everything necessary to ensure that the application of Article 7 is not necessary. But I also want to assure you that we will not hesitate to apply it, if necessary. Values are at stake that are too fundamental and essential to allow for contemplation or compromise. People and governments must be judged more by what they do than by what they say. And in the case of Austria, the statements are at the very least contradictory. On the one hand, any of us can compile a series of incendiary phrases from the leader of the Austrian Liberal Party. On the other, the program of the new Austrian government renews its commitment to the defense of democracy and human rights."	es
In March of last year, a member of Sam Rainsy's party was assassinated by a group of men in military uniform in Kandal province. In September, two party members were arrested on suspicion of involvement in a rocket attack on the prime minister. Note that this is the only Cambodian party without a military wing. In October, a parliamentarian from the same party was kidnapped by men in uniform and released only after a ransom was paid. The pattern of intimidation is clear. But other things are still happening in Cambodia: torture of prisoners, involvement of the army and police in the trafficking of women and children, excessive preventive arrests. All of this is on the agenda. Even more serious is the government's refusal to have the Khmer Rouge leaders tried by an international tribunal. It is true that the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tensions are lower. However, the way in which the political opposition is currently being treated is causing us deep concern, and if it continues this way, it must have consequences for the Union's relations with Cambodia. Mr. President, a new doctrine is emerging in international law, according to which no state may any longer treat its citizens and the people living on its territory haphazardly, and the sovereignty of a state can no longer prevent third parties from intervening in cases of serious human rights violations, even in cases where the leaders of a state were legally or even democratically elected. Vivid examples of this were the Pinochet-Ugarte case and Kosovo, or, less blatantly but within the Union itself, the debates over the formation of the new Austrian government. This development will now be jeopardized in Cambodia if the former leadership of the oppressive regime cannot be prosecuted. At the same time, the fight against impunity is being jeopardized. The situation should also remind us that ratification of the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow. Mr President, yesterday's debate on human rights was extremely useful. I am pleased that we once again had the opportunity to examine a number of regions of the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights is a particularly great challenge. First of all, with regard to Kosovo, the Committee fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions regarding the general policy towards Kosovo, the continuation of ethnic violence and the prisoners in Serbian jails. In Kosovo, as in the region, our efforts are aimed at short- and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilization. We particularly support the development of a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society. Our aid programs in the areas of democratization and human rights should continue to build trust in general and try to build trust between different communities in particular.	fr
B5-0173/2000 by MEPs Papayannakis and Sjöstedt, on behalf of the GUE/NGL, B5-0179/2000 by MEPs Schroedter and others, on behalf of the Greens/EFA Group, on the environmental disaster in the waters of the Danube. Mr President, this week we debated the Water Framework Directive, and the disaster in Romania shows us once again how seriously we must take water protection. This disaster has raised a number of important issues that concern us as a European Union. We welcome the promise that the rivers will be cleaned up with EU help. Raising environmental awareness, both in Romania and, more generally, in Central and Eastern Europe, is at least as important. We welcome the speed of Commissioner Wallström's visit there, as it can contribute to this awareness. Ultimately, this is a candidate state, and this disaster adds to the already existing concern about whether all candidate states will comply with EU environmental rules on time. The polluter must pay. I wonder if the European Union can pass on these kinds of costs to the environmental cowboys operating in the so-called Wild East by exploiting the weakness of the environmental legislation there. I would be in favour of that. Mr President, Commissioner, ecological disasters follow one another and, unfortunately, are similar. There is reason to be dismayed, once again, by this serious pollution that is now polluting the fourth largest wetland in Europe. The Danube Delta is in danger. As in Spain in April 1998, as in Brittany and Vendée since last December, this time again, an exceptional natural site is seriously threatened. In its resolutions, the European Parliament has constantly drawn attention to the dangers of this type that threaten our environment, disrupt our ecosystem and, once again, weaken populations. This new disaster raises the problem of integrating the acquis communautaire in environmental matters for the candidate countries. The authorities of these states, which are still very fragile from an environmental point of view, must overcome numerous obstacles. First, they should be able to prevent this type of spillage more effectively by remediating the most critical industrial sites; second, they should have sufficient technical means to stop such pollution and reduce its scale; and finally, they should be able to implement restoration programmes for the most affected and most sensitive sites. Today, the banks and waters of more than four rivers running through four states are polluted. This is why the European Union must focus its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to align themselves with Community environmental protection standards. But beyond this, it is the technologies and means implemented to prevent, and to deal quickly and effectively with, this type of disaster that are at stake.	fr
"Finally, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, European citizens must become aware of their citizenship. The euro and employment are not enough, nor even security. They need a ""European soul"", as a distinguished Spanish professor said. Mr President, unlike some speakers who have spoken previously, I want to return to the words spoken by the Portuguese ministers and Commissioner Vitorino. The words of this trio were music to our ears, as Mr Ceyhun said. As with any kind of music, the tune played must be in tune and properly orchestrated. Many of us in this House are very optimistic about the next six months. The tune that will be played will be the one that the people of Europe will listen to and will want to hear the right kind of tune. As has been said this afternoon, it will help to forget some of the unpleasant tunes that we have heard during the European elections and over the last few months. The Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere Council were based on this project of an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union. There is, however, one area that is very important and Parliament must be involved in it, and that is the area of scrutiny. There are many laws - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was presented to us last week - but we must be absolutely sure that there is scrutiny, that Members of this Parliament and Members of national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of all that they entail. We must also make sure that the details are applicable, adequate and relevant for the various countries. I would like to draw attention to some aspects of the resolutions that we have been discussing this afternoon, one or two of which have already been mentioned. I welcome the trend towards recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and cooperation in the fight against crime. This is an area to which the citizens of Europe will respond with interest and with which they will be satisfied. The Commission and the Council must be aware, however, that many of us in this House have reservations about the EURODAC system, for example. We accept the Council's leading role in this area, but there are some reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to what MEPs have to say when this issue is discussed. Mr Schulz said earlier that he was not sure what a 'scoreboard' is. Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what it is. A scoreboard is used to indicate the score and it must be up to date, clear and visible. I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will ensure that this is the case. At the end of six months, I hope that the music will still be playing and that Europeans will still be listening. Mr President, I would like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council and his colleague from the Ministry of Justice, Mr Costa, and thank them for the welcome they gave to my committee in Lisbon last week and for the constructive meeting we had. Amsterdam and Tampere have given us a lot of work to do together, as demonstrated by the excellent motion for a resolution tabled today by Mrs Terrón i Cusí."	it
To do this, we need a European Commission that, beyond good intentions, clarifies its guidelines and makes every effort to monitor the commitment of these resources by the Member States. Italy, for example, has had problems in the use of the Structural Funds in recent years, mainly due to excessive bureaucracy, poor information and the limited involvement of economic and social operators at local level. There are therefore two points to which I would like to draw the Commission's attention: firstly, we need to make the best use of concertation as a method of coordination and participation in decisions by all local and regional operators, precisely to avoid imbalances and inequalities; secondly, we need a real effort to simplify and make administrative processes transparent, which are too often unnecessarily long and complex to the point of jeopardising access to the Funds, something that small and medium-sized European enterprises in particular complain about. I conclude, Mr President, by saying that it is rather serious that the Commission communication has paid so little attention to territorial pacts and, above all, to ways of combating unemployment among women and young people. Mr President, like Mr Evans, I am particularly pleased to be able to stand up to make my first speech in this Parliament during the debate on such an important issue, especially given that I represent the West Midlands, a region of the United Kingdom that has so far benefited from funding under Objective 2. However, the report before us tonight is a clear example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce ideas that seem great but which in fact lack substance and therefore prove useless to those who should immediately benefit from them. The intention of the report is good but, as often happens when we deal with these issues, its objectives are not clearly defined and it lacks a solid basis that could make it of any use. That is why my group and I are proposing three substantial amendments and additions to the text, not so much to take away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those to whom it is intended to serve as a guide. Let me explain our reasoning. First, we want to ensure that the resources of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund are used appropriately. Past experience has taught us that we, as elected representatives of European taxpayers, must demand probity and financial transparency in the disbursement and control of these funds. Our amendments and additions are therefore aimed at finding indicators of profitability in the process of granting and spending the funds. Second, too often large sums of money are spent on projects whose results at the start of programming are inevitably vague. But halfway through or at the end of that period there is no effective way to stop a project that has proven to be useless. Therefore, our additions call for the provision of practically implementable termination strategies, so that not only is there the necessary guarantee in relation to current expenditure, often passed on to the taxpayer, but that the well-known syndrome can also be avoided whereby money continues to be spent to carry forward a project that has already proven to be a failure.	it
"These inspections can take place on the road, in ports or other parking areas, or, as regards public service vehicles, generally at the owners' premises. Indeed, several Member States already carry out checks of this kind, so-called ""roadside checks,"" as provided for in the directive, that is, somewhat unexpectedly. This is perhaps truly the best way to achieve effective monitoring of the condition of vehicles using our road network. I would like to say that the Commission is aware of Parliament's concern that this proposal could lead to discrimination against private hauliers or against commercial vehicles from certain countries or even certain makes of vehicle, and that its rapporteur intends, with his main recommendation, that the penalties imposed by Member States on owners be harmonised as a prerequisite for the application of this directive. We share this concern but believe that Amendment 2 is too radical, and in this sense we would support Amendment 3, which captures the spirit of what we are all seeking while offering sufficient flexibility. We also accept Amendment 1, and I would like to respond to what Mr Bouwman said. We are very concerned about the fact that vehicles are circulating on the Union's roads whose drivers are citizens of third countries, particularly candidate countries, and who do not have employment contracts in accordance with Community rules or those of a Community State, but simply follow the standards of those third countries, in many cases candidate countries, or sometimes not even that, because there are no appropriate checks in those third countries. I have therefore written to all the Transport Ministers of the fifteen Member States of the Union to initiate a debate on this issue and also to request a report on their experiences with such cases in their countries and what positive proposals they can put forward to resolve this problem, which is of great concern to us and which could have negative repercussions for road safety, which must be our primary concern, and for fair competition, to which we in the Commission also attach importance. In this spirit, I hope that we can address these issues at the next Transport Council at the end of this month, as well as all the issues, as Mr. Watts said, relating to road safety in general, since the Portuguese Government has identified it as one of the key issues during its Presidency. Based on the significant progress achieved in recent years, I believe that much remains to be done, because 42,000 to 43,000 European citizens dying on the roads is too high a figure. Greater efforts must be made. But on the issue of drivers from third countries, I would like to say that we hope to have an answer by the end of the month, and in any case, we will address it in the Council. And in the context of a question or initiative, I will be able to provide an answer here in Parliament, either during the plenary session or in committee. Otherwise, I certainly hope that we will be able to put forward a concrete proposal in the foreseeable future that will enable us to effectively and genuinely combat such abuses."	de
This does not prevent these Member States from taking measures related to public policy within the framework of the prior declaration obligation. The Commission also finds the proposal that legal residence in a Member State remain valid for three months after the expiry of the card's validity period unacceptable. It is unacceptable for a third-country national to continue residing in the host country for a longer period after providing services. For this reason, the Commission supports Ms. Palacio's Amendment 22 on both counts. Regarding the second proposal, the Commission understands the desire to clarify what is meant by a self-employed person and wishes to provide a solution for this in the amended proposal. These are some preliminary observations on the most important amendments. I hope you will allow me again at the end of this debate, when all speakers have spoken, the opportunity to go into detail on the various amendments. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the vast majority of members of the PPE Group will vote tomorrow in favor of the amendments from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the amended version. I will limit myself to commenting on two points. First of all, we must ask ourselves what the proposed directive is intended to achieve—in the literal sense of the term. On the one hand, there are the interests of the economy and also of the individual. In my considerations, I assume that this is an honest individual who does a good job. On the other hand, there are the interests of the Member States, which, for those affected, should perhaps proceed from the idea that this is a worst-case scenario. If we lean toward one of the extremes, namely the interests of the Member States, there are undoubtedly sufficient reasons to make the service provision card subject to relatively strict conditions. From this perspective, it is legitimate to introduce the obligation for prior declaration, even if the card is implemented. If I opt for the other extreme, that is, for the fewest possible formalities, I run the risk of the procedure coming to nothing, since, in that case, this directive will certainly not have the approval of the Member States. In other words, it's one of two things. Either I have a directive on the service provision card that actually doesn't allow the card to be issued to anyone, since the demands placed on the economy are too rigid, or I find myself without a directive. Both outcomes are unsatisfactory. Perhaps this is why, as we are told, the negotiations within the Council are also at a standstill. We have struggled to find a point of intersection between one interest—public policy—and another. We have struggled to find the simplest solution. We want a solution that imposes demands on the economy, but which, once these demands are met, guarantees simple implementation.	es
May I suggest, Madam President, that Parliament wait and see whether Mr. Haider's party will influence that country's politics. Then, and only then, could you assess whether human rights are being compromised. This Parliament could consider appropriate measures to address this situation, and then, and only then, could it consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a European Union country. Madam President, as a member of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns of some colleagues about democratic developments in Austria. You may perhaps be surprised by my reaction when I note that the particular sensitivity towards Austria, in its questioning appreciation of human rights, its sense of responsibility towards its own past, and the stability of democracy, meets with my personal understanding. Austria itself is responsible for the often dubious image that prevails abroad, rightly or unjustly. The years-long refusal of our governments to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of World War II, and their refusal to provide just reparations to the Jewish victims and forced laborers, have contributed significantly to this negative image. Now, the FPÖ has entered a governing coalition with the ÖVP, based on an electoral mandate from October 3, 1999, when the old government was voted out. This is the right of the citizens of a state, because it is the fundamental principle of a democracy. After the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP failed, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for support. We were offered three ministerial posts—you only need to read the newspapers—by the very party that is denounced here as fascist! When we suddenly rejected this offer, a passionate campaign of agitation and propaganda began that we still don't understand. The FPÖ is a well-established party in the Austrian political landscape. It provides the governor in one of the nine federal states and participates in all other governments. Why, so many Austrians are asking today, is their democratic decision suddenly being interpreted as an expression of fascist sentiment, why did the hate campaign only begin when the Freedom Party refused to support a minority SPÖ government? This is a prejudgment that—without addressing our platform—reduces the most gruesome epoch in European history to a political spectacle. I am filled with disgust when some of our opponents exploit the deaths of millions in the gas chambers of concentration camps for cheap propaganda, such as the Italian MP Bertinotti, who yesterday accused Mr. Haider of Holocaust denial on Italian TV. Shame on you, Mr. Colleague! Even if you run out of political arguments, you have no right to use the murdered victims for your cheap propaganda. You don't become an anti-fascist by denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi! On the contrary, they mock the true victims of National Socialism and trivialize fascist dictatorships. They act based on their own prejudices, forgo any political debate, and act in precisely the style they claim to oppose. The attack against Austria's new government, the attempt to exert political influence in a member state, is an insult to the Austrian people.	de
We cannot afford to delay. An ambitious timetable is essential. I do not consider it an overly bold approach, assuming that there will be no more discharges into waterways by 2020 and that we are aiming for zero pollution and emissions of toxic substances by that date. The aim is to do what is technically possible—nothing more, of course—but we must be sufficiently ambitious. I would like to address an issue that has already been raised. I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health, has defined the question of water redistribution too narrowly. This is not just a Spanish problem; it is also a problem in the Nordic countries. I sincerely hope that trust will be placed in national solutions, provided they are better from an environmental and economic point of view than those provided for in the directive. Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work. Water and air surround us everywhere. We share them with everyone on this earth. Water is a prerequisite for human life, which unites an increasing number of people. Mrs. Schleicher suggested this morning that clean water is an unrealistic demand. Nothing could be more wrong! It is unrealistic to gradually worsen water quality and thus the conditions for life. This is particularly unrealistic for agriculture, which of all depends most on clean nature and unpolluted natural resources. I would therefore like to appeal to the Members of this Parliament to recognize that a clean environment represents the greatest realistic long-term goal. Mr. President, we—and this applies to me personally too—support Mrs. Lienemann's report, the objectives it sets out, and the directive under discussion. Nevertheless, we should examine some aspects in more detail. For example, major problems in my country are the diversion of rivers and the damming of water by means of lakes – ostensibly development projects which in reality pose considerable risks to groundwater, the water table and surface water. Regardless of whether we ultimately reach agreement on who may decide on such diversions, I believe that the rules must apply equally to everyone and be extremely strict. However, the key point, Commissioner, is, in my view, planning for the restoration of the water table and the natural courses of rivers and the natural state of lakes, which can be achieved within the ten-year timeframe we have set. Such projects should certainly be eligible for subsidies so that they can receive financial support, because in the end, such restoration could prove to be an excellent development measure. Mr President, this is essentially a good measure. It sets realistic standards based on the principles of subsidiarity and river basin management. It pursues the right goal of ensuring good water quality for humans and animals, for the environment, and for economic purposes. Preventing water pollution and deterioration of water quality are desirable goals, as are the ability to manage water resources during periods of drought and flood.	de
It has been placed in the hands of a single Commissioner, Mr Antonio Vitorino, and we are also pleased about that. He has also been entrusted with the drafting of a scoreboard that will enable us to measure the progress actually made in this area at Community level, but also – and this seems important to me – at Member State level. We are pleased and congratulate the Council on these decisions, even though the Treaty of Amsterdam contained one disappointment for this Parliament: the five-year delay in the exercise of our role, our ability to participate actively, the democratic scrutiny of this area of justice, freedom and security, and the role that the Court of Justice must play within it. However, if, in examining the progress achieved in 1999, as is the mandate of the Treaty for this Parliament, we leave the field of grand declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and implemented, the panorama becomes rather bleak, Mr President. It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands, and what one signs and declares, the other distorts. Despite all the commitments made at the highest level, the Council has failed to take the decisions it intended to take. The programs are proliferating and overlapping, and there is no way to verify their implementation and effectiveness, or at least, this Parliament cannot. We have put a number of questions to the Council, and I know that the Portuguese Presidency is willing to answer each one. We hope that this Presidency will initiate a change in the Council's attitude toward this Parliament. I said there is no correlation between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually implemented. There are doubts in my group and in this House, for example, on an issue that should be good news: the communitization of Schengen. Schengen has—as we said before—been incorporated into the acquis, but this has been done in a very opaque context. No information, no request reached the European Parliament during this process, neither about the United Kingdom's association nor about the inclusion of Greece, nor about the negotiations with Norway or Iceland. The same can be said about immigration policy. We have passed the time by drafting mountains of reports, but we don't know what has happened to these initiatives; they have disappeared. We hope that 2000 will be the year of implementation, just as 1999 was the year of expectations. And we hope that the Council will also be willing to submit itself to the scrutiny of this House. The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy should be an integral part of the Union's internal affairs. The Council can act in accordance with its decisions or continue to shamefully thwart the involvement of the other institutions in this vital project. If it chooses the latter course, it must be aware that this entails risks and weakens the foundations on which the area of freedom, security, and justice is built.	de
One of the reasons we were very keen to present it was that, whether we like it or not, the European Union is notorious for fraud and mismanagement. This is sometimes exaggerated, but it is the case. We have to do something about it. Some of the measures we have taken in the past have not been implemented by some Member States... and we must not forget that Member States are responsible for implementing approximately 80% of the EU budget. Many of them have not signed, have not ratified, the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests, so it was clear that something more radical had to be done. We must take this task seriously. It is necessary to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union. The question is: who prosecutes? That's when we really run into difficulties. Whose responsibility is this when it comes to an organ that crosses so many borders? We must also be sensitive to the concerns of the Member States. The proposal to create a European Public Prosecutor's Office is very delicate. We all know that a completely federal approach and a situation in which a European judicial authority takes precedence over national judicial authorities is a step too far for some. But it is necessary to start the debate on this, which is why we will ask the IGC to initiate discussions on this. Of utmost importance to Parliament, as custodian of the European Union budget, is how to address the issue of individuals working in the European Union institutions. At a time when we are examining the entire reform process, it is crucial that we send the right signal. Citizens must understand that if they commit fraud, they will be prosecuted, and at the moment, that is not the case. Ms. Palacio has outlined the question of whether we have the legal authority to do so. I would like to say very clearly that my group will propose an amendment to delete the details of how the Commission should address this issue. We know this is a sensitive debate. We know that the Commission may need some leeway to negotiate a situation that would be acceptable to all parties. Let me say very clearly that this is not a commitment to a corpus juris, a commitment to a federal European public prosecutor's office. But it is a clear commitment to change the status quo, which is completely unacceptable. Mr. President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs. Theato on her report. I believe it is an excellent report, which will largely be supported by my parliamentary group. I only have the feeling that, deep down, she wanted to go a little further at this stage. Given the debates of the last five or six months, that could have been the case. We all know that in 1995 it was agreed that better criminal protection of the Union's financial interests had to be implemented.	es
I am referring to Cuba's expressed intention on February 2 to become a full member of the ACP group of countries. A Cuban delegation participated in the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, and Vice-Minister Dalmau appeared before the plenary, with whom a lively debate took place, followed by numerous conversations with many of us. After Nassau, a delegation from our Parliament, led by Mr. Corrie himself and the Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Joaquín Miranda, visited Havana, where a series of very enlightening exchanges of views took place. I have the impression that this mission from the European Parliament was the final push that convinced our Cuban friends of the opportune moment of taking a step forward in the mechanisms of cooperation with the European Union. We are facing a situation of considerable political importance, and I hope that, from the European Parliament, we will promote the appropriate favorable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union, which will prompt a positive response to Cuba's aspirations as quickly as possible. This will be important for at least three reasons. First, it will be important for Cuba, for the development and prosperity of its people, and for definitively breaking the blockade imposed by the United States, which has been repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations. Second, we must bear in mind that Cuba's candidacy has been supported by all ACP countries. If the European Union responds positively to the recommendation of our partners, we will be demonstrating respect and consideration for those partners, which will have positive effects throughout the framework of our cooperation with them. Nor can we ignore the value of a decision like the one I propose, as proof of the coherence and autonomy of the European Union and its non-subordination to any pressure. By accepting Cuba into the ACP Community, we will demonstrate that we are not a Europe immersed in the undignified dynamic of paying but not playing, and that when we were outraged by absurdities like the Helms-Burton Act, we were not doing so hypocritically but rather willing to act to the ultimate consequences. In a few weeks, the ACP-EU Joint Assembly will meet again, and I am sure this issue will be discussed within it. It would be desirable for the European Parliament's representatives to lend their support to Cuba's intentions during this process, as will undoubtedly be the case with their parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries. Cuba must, of course, comply with all the conditions laid down, just like any other partner. Cubans know this and will surely accept it. It must also be made clear that no more will be asked of Cuba than what has been asked of other interlocutors. Cuba's willingness to join is welcome, and Cuba is welcome to this circle of ours. I say this wholeheartedly, but also with the deep conviction that, just as the blockade has produced nothing but misery and, as a consequence, tension and hardening of the Cuban people, the integration we are supporting here and the prosperity that it brings will translate into the détente and openness that we all desire and from which we will all benefit, especially the Cuban people.	es
It took us fifteen years for the Economic and Monetary Union. We can take fifteen years for defense and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear. I also think that we must not underestimate—this is a question I am asking you—the influence and strength of the foreign ministry lobbies. We know the strength they have acquired over these forty years of community building. Today, they would have everything to lose from a communitarization of foreign policy, and I think they are working towards this. Finally, on the question of Kosovo—Mr. Cohn-Bendit was right to insist on this point—I believe it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the final status of this territory. Without this status, there will only be instability, murders, provocations from Belgrade, and the European Union must, as a matter of urgency, pronounce itself on this. Finally, I thank Mr. Poettering because I believe that Belgium's initiatives, as they say in somewhat clear language, are beginning to work. I think that many Member States, among the fourteen other Member States, would have many reasons not to collaborate in European Union meetings on matters of justice, for example. Four years after the arrest of Mr. Dutroux and his colleagues, we still have no trial, we still do not know what is happening. In terms of tourism too, many among these fourteen Member States might wonder about the advisability of discouraging holidays for parents with young children in Belgium, for example. So, it would be time, and I invite Mr. Solana and Mr. Patten, to inform our colleague, Mr. Michel, that perhaps he is overdoing it and that ultimately this risks, which I hope, backfiring on him. Mr President, I would first like to wish Mr Solana a very happy 1 March, the date on which a whole series of structures relating to the European Security and Defence Policy were put into operation. But I am actually wondering what he thinks about it. The documents mention good collaboration with the High Representative. You even said earlier that you discussed it at lunch; it would be the height of irony if you did not discuss it and if there were not good collaboration between the new structures and you! But do you not suffer from not chairing these structures yourself and not being at their centre? I would like – like many in Parliament, I believe – for you to be the driving force behind these structures and not to risk being sidelined in any way. In recent months, particularly in discussions with members of the NATO Assembly, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have sought to delineate the lines between the defence policy of the European Union and that of NATO.	fr
I must acknowledge the immense work you have done: the fast pace of meetings, the efforts made to establish a rapid response force, the concrete actions aimed at preventing, managing or resolving crises through civilian and, where necessary, military means. I would like to take advantage of your presence to ask you two questions that relate to the content of future actions. The first concerns the next European Councils in June and December and the extraordinary Council in Lisbon. What are the fundamental and priority developments that you would like to see achieved during the next Summits? And above all, what do you most need at these Summits? My second question is different, although it is somehow linked to the previous one. It concerns the next IGC. Do you not think that the agenda of the IGC should include the question of the European security and defence policy in order to complete the Treaties, should it emerge that the current wording of the texts does not allow for the implementation of a genuine defence policy? I believe that the Italian Prime Minister raised this point during your meeting on 24 February. Can you explain your position on this matter? Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have awakened Europe. The European Union is finally recognising that it cannot afford to leave the political and military initiative to the Americans all the time. The decision to create its own peacekeeping force is excellent. However, if Europe wants to be able to intervene militarily at a crucial moment, a flexibility clause must be included in the Treaty. Mr Solana can play an important role. He is not a madman, certainly not. He is a committed and competent man. However, we must ask ourselves whether this accumulation of functions is not excessive in relation to his competences. In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is Secretary-General of the WEU and High Representative for Foreign Policy. He is also responsible for the Policy Planning and Early Warning Unit. With all this work, will he find time to rest, Mr President? I believe that, from a democratic point of view, this accumulation of functions is fundamentally unacceptable, especially given that Mr Solana is not a democratically elected politician but a high-ranking civil servant who is not held accountable to any parliamentary assembly. His position threatens to overshadow that of Commissioner Patten, as has also been pointed out today. The impression is that, with the development of European security and defence policy, the Commission and Parliament are being excluded from this process. I believe that this exclusion is also unacceptable. Obviously, nothing should be left out that could make European policy more efficient, but this must not lead to an undesirable concentration of power. Mr Solana must awaken Europe without himself becoming tired. Mr President, the European Union was created first and foremost for peace. I am pleased that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have stressed this on several occasions.	it
Environmental bodies often lack the knowledge and procedures for integrating this dimension into their daily work. Naturally, I would like to know whether the Commissioner is prepared to integrate the gender dimension into environmental policy and environmental programmes. I think that is important. If the whole policy is to be permeated by it, I think it is essential that senior management should take on this basic notion. It is natural that, in my view of mainstreaming, it should permeate all our work. In the plan being developed by my Directorate-General, gender issues play a key role. I am prepared to take action myself, for example by moderating seminars on leadership or other topics, in order to encourage women to take on more and more tasks within the Commission. In order to motivate everyone, I think it is of the utmost importance that this message is conveyed throughout the hierarchy, both from the top down and from the bottom up. My understanding of environmental commitment in general is that it is often the prerogative of women. Since it needs to be spread, women also need to be given opportunities to take up senior or other positions in environmental work. I repeat that our action plan takes this into account, but there is certainly room for more. I have some experience of formulating and implementing plans in general. I hope that I can be of assistance. Question No 43 by the Honourable Member (h-0045/00): Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Harbour Company The Boyne Estuary region has already been designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Birds Directive and, as an area of international importance, is currently being considered for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive. However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have given permission for a new harbour to be built in the SPA, and even for the removal of a mud flat at Stegrennan which was recently incorporated into the SPA at the specific insistence of the Commission. In addition, a huge warehouse has been built - for which planning permission is proving difficult to obtain - and Drogheda Corporation is planning further infrastructure. How can the Commission ensure that this type of development, funded through the Structural Funds, does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the region? Is the Commission prepared to suspend funding altogether, pending a review of the development plans for this area? The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour, but has no information on either the warehouses or the other infrastructure mentioned by the Honourable Member. The development of the port is being financed by the Structural Funds and essentially involves the dredging of the Boyne Estuary and the temporary storage of the dredged spoil on the mudflat at Stegrennan. The Boyne Estuary region is classified as a Special Protection Area under the Birds Directive. This means that any exploitation activity in or near the Boyne Estuary which may affect the Special Protection Area must comply with the provisions for the protection of the area set out in the EU Habitats Directive.	it
You have the good, charming idea that the outcome and benchmark for your policies and your five-year program would be the election result or turnout in the next European elections. When I imagine presenting your work program to my voters, whom I see weekly and to whom I have to explain it weekly—not in the high echelons of important politics, but on the street—then I ask myself, what should I say then? Mr. Prodi, what should I say that's new about it? There's nothing new about your work program. You used 12 pages for five years, and 18 pages for a one-year work program. Does that give me hope for the year 2000? No, it doesn't! In your 2000 work program, you say something very clever. You say that environmental concerns must be integrated into all other policy areas. Have you done that, Mr. Prodi, and have you also read your work program for this year? Because you haven't! You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement, even though it will be one of the core issues surrounding enlargement. Nor have you integrated it into economic policy, competition, or the internal market. You have not done that anywhere. You have pieced together individual pieces, but you have not created an overall structure. When you said earlier in your speech that a disaster like the one on the Danube must be the reason for a disaster program—no, Mr. Prodi, we must finally begin implementing legislation and also ensuring that legislation is monitored. In your five-year program, you write that the people of the European Union rightly expect better food standards and better food legislation. Mr. Prodi, you don't know what you're talking about! The European Union's food legislation is the most ambitious in the world! What's lacking and lacking is implementation in the member states and monitoring. Finally, take your task seriously as President of the Commission, to pull the member states by the ears and force them to fulfill their tasks and duties! They shouldn't just be pursuing hobbies, but doing their everyday, normal work. This is what we expect from you in the next five years! Madam President, Mr. President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen! As Chairman of this Parliament's Committee on Fisheries, you, Mr. Prodi, are not making things easy for me at all. I feel compelled here and now to publicly criticize the absence of fisheries in the program you have presented to us. The next five years of the Prodi Commission—you solemnly announce this in the first of your conclusions—will be marked by major changes. I hope that this change you announce, judging by your pitiful and absolute silence on this matter in your program, will not consist in an even greater marginalization of fisheries. Not a single line, not a single word on fisheries or the CFP. I am not asking you for details or precise indications, but a mention would, I believe, be necessary. How can you completely forget a common—I emphasize common—policy with such economic, social, and regional impact—and therefore with consequences for Europe's economic and social cohesion?	de
At this stage I will simply say that I hope that it will be integrated into the programming of rural areas under Objective 2, just as the EAGGF, Guidance Section, is integrated into the Objective 1 regions. In any case, I have noted how vigilant the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is on these issues. Before concluding, I would like to say to Mr Savary that the specific debate on the consequences of the storms that have hit France, Austria and Germany in particular in recent weeks is scheduled for tomorrow, as is the debate with my colleague, Mrs de Palacio, on the lessons to be learned from the oil spill that hit the French coast. With your permission, Mr Savary, I reserve my position on this issue, which largely coincides with the recommendation you made on what can be done to combat the oil spill in the context of Objective 2. I would remind you that tomorrow the Commission will approve the map of the areas recognised as Objective 2 for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg, which will provide us with a working tool, in particular for a large part of the departments affected by the storms. That is why the day after tomorrow I will be visiting the two French departments that were seriously damaged by the bad weather. In conclusion, I would like to thank the President for his understanding and the rapporteur for the quality of her work and that of her parliamentary committee, and I would also like to say that, regardless of some differences of opinion on the role of the guidelines - we have discussed this and I have tried to make my point clear - I am very pleased with the support expressed by this Parliament for the Commission to draw up the guidelines submitted to the Member States in order to prepare the national programmes. This can only support the concept based on good practices drawn from the experience of the programmes for the period 1994-1999. I believe it to be a good omen for effective cooperation between our two institutions, at the time of starting the programming for 2000-2006, a good practice of working together, consolidated, Mr Hatzidakis, by respect for the Code of Conduct which is imposed on our two institutions and which is particularly close to my heart. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow, at 12.00. Situation, social and economic development of the regions of the Union The next item is the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the socio-economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union (SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)). Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the sixth periodic report on the situation and social and economic development of the regions of the European Union marks an important step forward in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this field since the publication of the fifth periodic report. However, I believe that talking about a real convergence of average regional development in Europe gives a somewhat incomplete picture of reality, and unfortunately that is precisely the message conveyed by the press and proclaimed in certain speeches.	it
"We must provide a satisfactory response. Flora Brovina's case is never just one. We rightly mention it in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds, thousands of Flora Brovinas. I call on the Commission and the absent Council to finally do something for these political prisoners. The fact that they are imprisoned in Serbia contributes to the foundations of the disorder and violence in Kosovo. Mr President, in paragraph 10, the joint draft resolution before us rightly calls on the Council and the Member States of the European Union to redouble their efforts to provide the United Nations police force with the necessary personnel and resources. This request is in full agreement with the opinion of the United Nations High Representative in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner. To fulfill his mission of restoring and maintaining law and order in Kosovo, he estimates that he will need at least 6,000 foreign police officers. The United Nations promised to send a police force of 4,800 men. To date, Kouchner has only 2,000 police officers at his disposal. Furthermore, half of this group comes from the United States and Germany. It is understandable that the UN High Representative in Kosovo is largely unhappy with this situation, especially given the endemic ethnic violence in the region. Yet, Kouchner's sharp criticism of the French government in recent days is astounding. Paris is completely abandoning its compatriot in the region by providing it with a handful of police officers, no more than 37. According to Kouchner, the culprit for this dishonorable position on the part of France is none other than Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement. According to Kouchner, he is obstructing the dispatch of French police officers to Kosovo for ideological reasons. I ask the Council and the Commission to examine these serious accusations in depth and to inform the European Parliament about them. Freedom of the press in Angola Mr President, I will not repeat the premise from earlier: I could be accused of unfair publicity. On the ""Angola"" issue, I think that a first result is to finally have a resolution. This has not happened in our Parliament for a very long time. So, I welcome it as such. I believe that the European Union and the West, in general, have been targeting Mr. Savimbi in their crossfire for some time, without any discrimination, but that the corruption in Mr. Dos Santos' regime is now such that even his long-time friends are beginning to struggle to pretend they see nothing. So, I believe that it is urgent to be able to make a general political resolution, where we could get to the bottom of things, in particular also on some rather worrying things, which are being discussed, notably logistical support given, at the level of the intelligence services, by the United States and Great Britain, the widespread corruption of the regime linked to multinational oil companies, and many other things, certainly very ""tasty"", which will have to be explored in depth."	fr
Mr. President, Commissioner, the measures provided for in this directive range from the development of water management plans, broad rights of information and consultation, and greater cooperation between Member States, to combating water pollution by specific harmful substances. Knowing how many years this House has been trying to achieve a framework directive of this nature, I am pleased that we have reached this point today and would like to congratulate Mrs. Lienemann, who has been fortunate enough to be able to present this report today. However, I also think it is extremely important to note an aspect that many consider self-evident. Nevertheless, I would like to emphasize it. The directive provides no legal basis, under any form, for diverting water from the territory of a Member State against its will. In order to confirm this point once again, I have tabled an amendment—with strong support from the EPP, for which I am grateful—and I would be very pleased if it were to receive the affirmative vote of the House tomorrow. Its purpose is to make it clear that water—as has been repeatedly emphasized today—is not an ordinary commodity, but a good that belongs to the population of the relevant Member State of the Union and that must receive protection and treatment that take this fact into account. I know, and the previous speaker emphasized, that some European Union states have water problems. I believe that all of us have the opportunity to better manage water in our countries and to promote less polluting use of water. No country can be exempt from this effort. Only when each country has made the maximum effort to conserve its water resources, when everything possible has truly been done in our own countries, only then can we, in my opinion, contemplate a shared use of water, if necessary. Mr. President, Commissioner, it should be a cause for joy that the second reading of this directive is now on the table. However, I must say that I am not overly pleased because I believe it is a directive of poor quality, that it will pose many problems in implementation, and that it has many shortcomings. First of all, I think it's an excessively harsh and simplistic, reductionist directive. Other existing directives regarding water have often not been complied with, and governments and the Commission have often failed to impose discipline as they should have, although I know it's not pleasant. It's not a question of having much tougher regulations because the problems in many cases are management-related, of assuming one's responsibilities and not transferring the major problems of the water system, whose complexity we all know to be, to the legislature. A reductionist directive has been drafted; countries with navigable rivers cannot be lumped together with others that lack water, whose land is open with large cracks due to the lack of it, and whose temperatures are 55 or 60 degrees Celsius in the sun.	es
But from the political side, control must be properly reestablished. The triangle of Commission, Council, and Parliament must also be reestablished in the field of foreign and security policy, where so far too much has been left to the Council, and here especially with regard to the crude crisis management measures, where the powers lie exclusively with the Commission. All of this has not been sufficiently incorporated into this overall concept. We must examine whether, in this regard, changes are not necessary within the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference. The Portuguese Presidency of the Council has said yes, that it will reconsider this matter with a view to eventually extending the mandate. I would like to draw attention to another important point. The discussions we are holding these days, for example, on the government of a country in Europe show, however, that we must reflect the moral orientation, the rule of law, and the common good of the European Union, and that, for this reason, we must introduce legally binding fundamental rights into the Treaty, as this will be a decisive stabilizing element. I ask those who still have deep reservations about this matter to reconsider whether now is not the time to view it in this context as well and perhaps to muster the courage to appropriately promote fundamental rights in this area. The European Union does not need, or hardly needs, new instruments or new powers. What it needs are the instruments to be able to exercise its powers. For this reason, we must adopt the necessary measures to ensure that these instruments enable us to fulfill, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks already formally assigned to us by the Treaty. I believe that the efforts of this Intergovernmental Conference should be particularly focused on this point. If we make progress in this area, then we will be able to face the historic task of enlargement of the European Union with greater confidence. This is the decisive point. Honorable Presidency of the Council, I am convinced that under your leadership, it will be successfully shaped. Mr. President of the Council, you have been able to understand, after listening to several speeches, that within the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of the political groups in this Parliament, the prevailing view, not without differences, was to trust the Portuguese Presidency and not increase its difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference. I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this last week within the committee I chair; however, in the end, we decided to back the Portuguese Presidency, and we truly want to win the bet. You told us about the start of your tour of various capitals and the difficulties some states face in reaching a consensus in their countries and, therefore, in their parliaments. I would like to inform you that yesterday we had, I believe, a very interesting day of debate and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments, who were represented by qualified and committed delegations.	es
We are ultimately concerned about the stability of the financial markets, not because it is the goodwill of the financial markets, but because it also affects our growth, our investments, and our jobs within the European Union. In this regard, we must ask ourselves what instruments we have at our disposal to effectively generate a certain order, which has been lacking until now. We have all contributed to the liberalization of financial transactions; to date, however, we do not have a functioning regulatory framework, and we have had bitter experience of this with the repercussions of the crises in Asia and Latin America. It is therefore high time that we consider, first, supervisory rules and, second, the transparency of the financial markets and the information relating to them. It is important that we know the players and their solvency. We must also ask ourselves whether there is not a requirement for fiscal justice. At a time when the tax burden on the labour factor is increasing both at European and international level, we must consider how to achieve effective taxation of capital income and, in this area, we must also consider the taxation of short-term financial transactions. I believe it is really important to have a thorough report and conclusions from the Commission so that we, as the European Parliament, can see whether the European Union should not, together with the USA and Japan, ensure that international solidarity is truly achieved in order to increase the stability and security of the economy and the financial markets. This is the intention behind this oral question, and we will need to achieve a balanced and truly forward-looking proposal in Parliament, through the regulatory procedures through committees and plenary meetings. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must express, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, my surprise at the current debate on international capital flows and their possible taxation. Although it is not mentioned in the text, it looks like an attempt to resurrect, as was done in the introduction, the issue of the tax proposed a few years ago by Mr Tobin, which our group opposed clearly and categorically during the previous legislature with a series of arguments set out clearly and coherently by our Chairman, Mr Cox. Arguments that, modestly, I will have to repeat during my speech, given that the issue is being raised again. We do not agree with this type of taxation because its application, provided it is possible, would not serve the objectives that Mr Tobin presented in his time and that the left in this House seems to want to resurrect. First of all, there is no evidence that taxing international capital flows could reduce the risks of volatility or instability in international markets. On the contrary, since it is certain that not all countries would accept it, we would open the door to speculation and fraud, which would cause volatility, instability, insecurity, opacity, and unfair competition in the financial services sector that operates internationally. Moreover, the idea of obtaining resources to use them for economically more needy countries is so complex, when we consider its practical application, that it is simply impossible.	fr
"The second problematic aspect concerns the data to be collected under the Regulation. Firstly, as regards economic data, Amendment 2 provides for two changes. The first is to ensure that the data collected is limited to the objective to be pursued. The second change consists in replacing the reference to sales products and other financial income, subsidies, interest received, etc., with a simple reference to the volume of sales. It is thought that without these changes Member States might have to bear too high a cost for data collection and there would also be a problem of confidentiality. In line with these changes, the reference to accounting entries has been deleted in Amendment 5. Secondly, as regards environmental data, the original proposal only refers to biological and economic information. However, the Commission has made it clear that it intends to engage in wider environmental studies and pilot projects and that it may wish to extend the range of data collected by Member States at a later stage. Amendment 3 brings the data needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems into the Regulation. This will obviously facilitate the introduction of a new regulation on environmental data, and may even make it unnecessary. It should be stressed that the amendment does not in any way oblige the Commission to include the collection of such data either in the minimum or in the extended programme, but gives the Commission the possibility to do so. As has already been said, the proposal for a Council decision can be divided into two parts. The first concerns the financing of the Member States for the implementation of Community programmes. The second provides that the Commission itself may finance studies and pilot projects. There are some minor amendments, such as Amendment No 2, which aims to ensure that the financial contribution to the Member States can cover not only the costs of data collection, but also those of their management, compilation, aggregation, etc. Amendments Nos 3 and 6 aim to speed up the implementation of the Regulation and to allow Member States to know the content of the programmes as soon as possible. These amendments also aim to align these implementation times with the dates and with the Regulation. Amendments Nos 1 and 2 aim to ensure that the Commission itself can finance studies and pilot projects. Amendments 4 and 5 are designed to ensure that financial information is provided continuously to the budgetary authority. More specifically, through Amendment No 1, the Committee on Fisheries accepts the recommendation of the Committee on Budgets that the funding should be placed under Heading 1b rather than Heading 3 of the financial perspective. Although in the preliminary draft budget the Commission had placed the appropriations under Heading 3 ""Internal policies"", Parliament has created the new budget item B1-500 to finance the measures we are discussing, in order to ensure that the necessary resources continue to be available. Mr President, I think it appropriate to fully agree with Mrs Attwoll who, at the beginning of her excellent report, said that the two Commission proposals, aimed at gaining a better understanding of the scientific and socio-economic situation of the fisheries sector, come at a critical time."	it
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, we can be satisfied with the global scope of the objectives announced, which are commensurate with the challenges that Europe will have to face. I see that you consider the fall of the Berlin Wall to be the essential element of this end of the century. It is an event that heralds enlargement. Rather than using the word ""enlargement"", I would almost like to speak of reunification, a term that seems to me to be charged with much greater political meaning. You return to the idea of concentrating your activities on the most important missions; this is an objective of your reform and, in essence, of applying the principle of subsidiarity. Clearly applying this principle will certainly benefit the actions carried out by giving citizens a clear image of each level of competence. Mr Prodi, there is a world of difference between saying and doing! You will have to fight against the tendency typical of the institutions to try to extend their powers. I will judge accordingly on the facts. And, in the meantime, I give my approval and encouragement to the will that clearly emerges from your communication. However, there are two essential points: simplification and application of Community law. In 1998, 123 appeals were lodged with the Court of Justice for failure to apply or transpose; 25 percent of the directives in the environmental sector are not applied or transposed. Recent events demonstrate the absolute need for this. Community law must not remain unapplied because it is too complex or hair-splitting. The Union must not give in to this bad habit and, on this point too, I regret that your communication does not go into sufficient detail. You are realistic about the impossibility of the welfare state providing adequate answers to today's problems, which include unemployment. Nevertheless, I regret that no clear alternative has been proposed. It would have been correct to underline the rejection of any welfare policy, accompanied, however, by the valorisation of the spirit of initiative and responsibility. You do not mention the ageing of our population, which will have substantial repercussions on the structure of our society, not only from an economic point of view, but also in terms of public health. In fact, it is a silent revolution and, from this point of view, I expected more from your communication. Finally, you insist on European research as a central element of our future, without however indicating the instruments you intend to implement. Ethical principles are also at the heart of this research, but your communication does not say so. Mr President, you intend to inform citizens better: start by strengthening ties with Parliament, because we are the citizens' representatives. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we can only agree with the general orientations of the five-year programme and the programme for the year 2000, illustrated with such passion by President Prodi this morning. In the two documents, strong emphasis was placed on the need to define new forms of European governance and to implement, for this purpose, a new agenda for the Commission, defining more stringent priorities in pursuing the objective of full employment, through more effective coordination of the economic and social policies of the States and - I would like to underline - first and foremost of the nations that have joined the Monetary Union and which must be put in a position to constitute the first example of enhanced cooperation."	it
By placing finance first, this movement has strengthened the need for profitability and tightened management conditions everywhere. This is the context for mergers, acquisitions, corporate restructuring, and the collection of enormous resources on the financial markets that continues to grow. Unemployment and the pressure on workers around the world tend to increase. Markets and real growth are hindered. The brutal inflow or withdrawal of speculative capital threatens the economies of many countries, to the point of sinking, as has happened in Asia, Russia or Brazil. Faced with this neoliberal globalization, under the domination of the financial markets, there is a growing need, as demonstrated by our request, for another idea of the world according to which the common law would be that dictated by the duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world. No one can ignore the challenge to civilization represented by the lack of nearly a billion jobs. The need to allow unprecedented efforts in terms of development, access to knowledge. In this regard, all ideas deserve to be taken into consideration and we believe that the Tobin tax is an important proposal, as are other forms of transactions that could be envisaged. The tax in question can help curb speculation, without penalising the activities of the real economy, and would make new resources available for investment in human resources, and this at a time when the UNDP estimates that 40 billion dollars a year is the sum needed to eradicate poverty, provide access to drinking water for all, and meet health needs. At a time when the debate on the capacity or otherwise of politics to influence the economic sphere has been launched at a global level, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political will to reconquer the democratic spaces confiscated by international financial operators. I would like to respond to the Commissioner who said that to achieve this result, a minimum number of industrial countries is needed. It seems to me that the European Union is made up of a fair number of industrial countries and I think, like Mr Désir and several other Members who have spoken, that the European Union that we have formed can take the initiative in this regard. In any case, I believe that the European Parliament would be honoured to echo the desire of the citizens to control the world in the sense of well-being for all. Madam President, I too am pleased that this long-awaited debate is taking place. We know very well that each generation, over time, has blindly relied on what could be called a dominant ideology, that is to say a series of prejudices accepted as such by general conformism and which, however, end up revealing to subsequent generations how full of drama they were. Free trade and the constant exaltation of globalization constitute, in our opinion, the dominant ideology of today, that is to say the grave error of this end of the century, as dangerous as was once the ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or, even before that, the certainty erected into a dogma according to which the earth was flat.	it
I am sure that, with the spirit you have shown here today, the first thing that will happen, in this new climate of understanding between us, is that you will take into consideration the motion for a resolution that we will submit to you. Question Time (Council) The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine the questions addressed to the Council. Question No. 1 by (H-0780/99): Subject: Construction of a nuclear power plant in Turkey, vulnerable to earthquakes. The two recent earthquakes measuring over 7 on the Richter scale in Turkey raise serious doubts about that country's insistence on building extremely expensive nuclear reactors at Akköy, while the energy reserves of the Ataturk Dam are exported to third countries and the EU, by cutting its budget, pays for the damage caused by the earthquakes. Turkish nuclear projects, which ignore the risks they pose to the inhabitants and ecosystems of Turkey and the entire region, give rise to suspicions that they are hidden behind preconceived plans by the Turkish political-military hierarchy to acquire nuclear technology that would make it possible to build nuclear weapons, given the intention to acquire Canadian-made reactors similar to those possessed by India and Pakistan. What measures has the Council taken or intends to take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that seeks to join the EU and spends enormous sums on nuclear programs while receiving European funds as economic aid? Mr. President, the Council wishes to clarify that Turkey is a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, whose objectives coincide with the concerns expressed by the Honourable Member. Indeed, that Convention, which entered into force on 24 October 1996, aims specifically to achieve and maintain a high level of nuclear safety worldwide through national measures and international cooperation, as well as to establish and maintain protection against potential radiological risks at nuclear facilities in order to protect individuals, society, and the environment from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation that such facilities can emit. As is known, the Convention also covers the prevention of accidents with radiological consequences and the mitigation of those consequences when such accidents occur. Furthermore, I would like to point out to the Honourable Member that Turkey, as a candidate country for accession to the European Union, must sooner or later, that is, as a precondition for accession—and I believe this point is important—accept, within the framework of its own pre-accession strategy, a set of policies in order to be able, in due time, to accept the Community acquis in its entirety, including, consequently, all the provisions in force regarding nuclear safety. Thank you for your reply. But I would like to add the following: With this unit, Turkey intends to increase its energy potential by only 2%. Yet, it reportedly wants to acquire Candu-type reactors, the same ones Pakistan and India acquired, with which they developed nuclear weapons.	es
(Applause from the right) It is through diplomacy, persuasion, culture, solidarity, and not through unconstitutional means, that the Institutions will be able to gain respect and ensure that principles are respected. Bilateral relations involve the States, so the fourteen Member States have nothing to do with them. This amounts to substituting for the European Institutions to defend political logic with an incompetence worthy of parties barely emerging from totalitarian systems and not representatives of democratic traditions. As we have already written on several occasions, many things, too many things, separate us from Haider, notably his claims to Alto Adige, which is very Italian. We knew that. Today, we see with anguish that other representatives of the Union seem to have renounced the democratic role of Europe. We are in favor of legality and democracy expressed by the people, of respect for national sovereignty as long as it does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights. We believe in Europe, while others seem to have begun the process of disintegrating the Union. These are the results of hasty enlargements and a lack of clarity regarding roles and responsibilities. We have created a Europe of the circus market, not one of principles, rights, and politics. These are the consequences! We can therefore only call on the Commission to continue on the path of moderation and to support those who are working to ensure that the autonomy and sovereignty of the Austrian people are respected, while ensuring that this people remains free and shows solidarity with others. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today we have a date with hypocrisy. We have a Council that has managed to flout the Treaty and use a method completely outside Articles 6 and 7, which allowed, in the event of serious and persistent violations, the condemnation of a State. In this case, there are no serious and persistent violations in Austria. There are risks - we are all aware of them - but there is absolutely no serious or persistent violation as it stands. If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7, if we were to apply the Copenhagen criteria to our institutions, to the European Union, this European Union would most certainly not be able to become a member, as is being asked of the countries of Eastern Europe. And if we are talking about serious and persistent violations, we can perhaps talk about certain Member States, we can talk about Italy and France, respectively the first and third countries condemned by the Council of Europe, by the Strasbourg Court. We can talk, dear Belgian colleagues, about Belgium, the Dutroux affair, the dozens and dozens of children abducted, tortured, raped, murdered by figures from that country and whose investigations are bogged down, still bogged down. We could, dear colleagues, a third of the Members of Parliament, force the Council and the Commission to question this. We could question the fact that the Austrians reject ten years, thirteen years of party rule that has corrupted and rotted a country – Austria – just as it is rotting and corrupting countries like Italy, Belgium and other Member States of the Union.	fr
Therefore, we will try to be perfectly clear about how and when to apply it. Mr. President, Commissioner, the communication states, referring to the relationship between science on the one hand and recourse to the precautionary principle on the other, that invoking the precautionary principle always requires a political decision when scientific evidence is lacking. This puts considerable power in the hands of science. We can ask ourselves: what kind of scientists will provide us with this documentation and what do they defend? The communication also states that it is sufficient for there to be a sufficiently recognized minority of scientists to invoke the precautionary principle. I would like to ask you: what is the definition of a recognized minority? How do you define it? And how do you arrive at a recognized minority? If it is a political decision, I would like to ask you: who will make that political decision? The Commission? The Council? To what extent will the European Parliament play a role in this? What is the role of the scientific committees? What will be the role of the food authorities that you will establish? Finally, will all decision-making be done transparently and publicly? Those are my three questions. Yes, Mr. President, that is true. There are many aspects that are difficult and not always perfectly clear, but I will try to answer some questions. Who will make the decision, who are the decision-makers? Well, that depends on who the legislators are. It is part of risk management. We need to analyze, for example, the level of concern in society about a specific issue and judge based on what we know about the scientific evidence in some cases. But it is true that it is not necessary for a large majority of the scientific community to resort to the precautionary principle. The principle can be used based on the evidence of a minority or in cases where the science is incomplete. That is where we need to find the balance between this principle, as a political tool, and the science. It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is carried out, but it is not a question of changing the scientific basis. We turn to experts to obtain all possible scientific information before taking action; and this will continue in the future. We must consider it a tool for managing risk factors. We must decide whether we want to endanger people, for example, or whether we want to protect the environment; and we must study the available scientific data. An assessment of all these factors and the scientific evidence is required. We then make the decision whether to take action or not. Therefore, there are no answers to all your questions, but that does not alter the system of turning to scientists as we currently do, nor the system of experts we currently use. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question about a specific, current case in which the precautionary principle could be applied.	es
"There are two reasons for our refusal. First, this is a terribly complex and highly sensitive legal issue, and the proposal presents, in my view, certain risks to legal certainty that have not been acknowledged. This reason in itself is sufficient to explain our refusal to vote for the proposal, but there is a second reason: even though it is a convention, that is, a collaboration between states, the proposal reveals very clear tendencies, namely the creation, in the longer term, of a common European jurisdictional area, a common European penal code and a common European administration of justice. We are opposed to this development, we are against this mantra ""an area of freedom, security and justice"", which consists of barbarically creating community systems that cripple certain legal traditions linked to these sensitive and important issues, which are above all national prerogatives. Mr President, I too believe that the convention we are examining today is only a small step, still too small, in the construction of the common area of freedom, security and justice that – we hope – Europe will one day become. Europe is today an area of free movement of goods and people where crime knows no borders, while difficult obstacles still stand in the way of those who must combat it. A small step – I said – but a welcome one. The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has specifically sought to prescribe further limits and protections in the name of defending the fundamental rights of individuals, which are in force in the States and within the Union, even if they are not yet enshrined in a Charter of Rights of the European Union which, we hope, will soon see the light of day: fair limits and protections because the rights in force are, unfortunately, not always concretely respected by all public authorities in all States. In certain passages of the Commission's proposals, precautions have undoubtedly been exaggerated, such as when it was intended to leave the accused the choice of accepting or refusing his temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of the investigation. Personally, I cannot accept, for example, that Mr. Pinochet should be allowed to choose whether or not to be transferred to Spain for a confrontation. Or again, when it was intended that the witness or expert – and not only the person under investigation, the accused – should have the right to a lawyer for remote interrogations. These are minor flaws, unintended by the rapporteur, which will – I hope – be remedied by the vote of this House. The rapporteur has done a commendable job, which I acknowledge and for which I thank him. The overall result is appreciable and I hope that the Council will take it fully into account. As other Members have already pointed out, one point – the most delicate one – remains unresolved: Article 18 of the Convention concerning the interception of communications taking place in a Member State, carried out directly by another Member State without requesting mutual assistance from the State where the interception takes place, a procedure made possible these days thanks to modern technologies."	fr
The Helsinki European Council approved enlargement to 13 Member States. There is therefore inconsistency between the opening of accession negotiations with these 13 countries and the desire to carry out only a de minimis reform. As far as we are concerned, in line with the logic of the Treaty, we want the agenda of the next intergovernmental conference to allow for a much more far-reaching reform of the Union. That said, Mr. President, Parliament is holding this debate today because it did not want to delay the start of the conference. Theoretically, we could have done so. We could have voted on the 17th of this month, so that the conference could not have started on the 14th. But we did not want to do so because we wanted to send a clear political message to the governments and candidate countries: we want to carry out this reform precisely to facilitate enlargement. Mr President, I am pleased to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency, because it has earned great esteem within this House. The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament's aspirations and has undertaken to do its utmost to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference includes other subjects, which are absolutely necessary. I would like to say, Mr President, that this aspiration of the European Parliament is selfless. In any case, the European Parliament will emerge politically strengthened by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference, quite simply because, at this Intergovernmental Conference, in accordance with what was decided in Helsinki, we will examine which matters currently subject to unanimity will be moved to qualified majority voting. The number of matters decided by qualified majority voting will therefore increase. However, the acquis communautaire already provides that legislative matters decided by qualified majority voting will also be subject to codecision by Parliament. Consequently, if qualified majority voting is extended, Parliament's codecision will also be extended. But Parliament would not be fulfilling its task as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the Union's political project. We are working on this. We believe that other issues need to be addressed in the context of this Union's political project. Among other issues, those related to the integration of security and defense issues into the Treaty, subjects that have made considerable progress recently but which should be introduced into the Treaty. The same goes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, of course, which we began drafting yesterday, and I believe that this has begun in a very positive way. We will work seriously to ensure that Europeans see that being European represents a plus and that European citizens have fundamental rights that bind the Union's institutions. Consequently, Mr President, our proposals, which we will put into practice in a new report, will constitute, together with the proposals of the Commission, which has produced an excellent document - I am pleased to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - documents of the Conference.	fr
But even the decision of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best that could have been achieved. It does have some weaknesses. The greatest weakness, in my view, is that the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises is not sufficiently taken into account, but the automotive industry is not only made up of large corporations. Small and medium-sized enterprises play a very important role, especially in the supplier sector, and we must also consider the interests of the employees in these small and medium-sized enterprises. Well over two million people work in this sector. Many of the amendments proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as well as our group's amendments to Article 5 regarding costs, also serve to address this situation of small and medium-sized enterprises. In terms of environmental policy, the common position is also not a shining example. There is a lack of perspective on the bigger picture, and when my colleague from the Green Party says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has watered down a common position, then that is unacceptable. After all, it makes no environmental sense for us to prevent modern, fuel-efficient cars like the 3-liter car, which uses a lot of plastic, through rigid, high recycling quotas! Therefore, we must support an amendment that at least allows for exceptions when we have particularly fuel-efficient cars. The industry's objections in this area are certainly not illogical. However, the arguments of the plastics and automotive industries would also increase if we were committed to reducing CO2 in Europe in more than just this context. Mr President, we are indeed in an unusual situation at the moment: those who want to stand up for environmental values are supporting the Council's common position. Unlike the previous speaker, I am truly proud that we achieved a common position during the Finnish Presidency that defends environmental values. If we overturn the Common Position and attempt to share the disposal costs, we will create loopholes: We will fail to achieve a sensible, clear system that regulates responsibilities. Therefore, in my opinion, the primary responsibility must lie with the manufacturer. Only in this way can we adequately solve the problem and also create incentives for manufacturers to produce vehicles that can be disposed of as cheaply as possible in the future. Mr. President, the Council's draft directive contains two fundamental problems. First, there is the unconditional obligation for manufacturers to take back end-of-life vehicles. This risks creating a monopoly in the dismantling industry, particularly in areas with great distances and numerous small businesses involved in dismantling. I believe that an EU directive, regardless of its content, must not disadvantage small and medium-sized enterprises within the Union. The unconditional responsibility of manufacturers also endangers the used goods market, as the manufacturer is obliged to sell new parts to a greater extent. However, this trade is particularly important for those who collect and recondition older vehicles. Even from a market economy perspective, this principle is rather dubious. Companies must be able to change, be sold, and be liquidated. They must establish themselves in new markets, but also be able to leave old ones. Binding manufacturers to a responsibility that can extend far into the past is ill-suited to a flexible and development-promoting market economy.	de
First of all, I would like to point out that the debate on social protection issues began within the European institutions several years ago and that, in 1995, the first communication entitled 'The future of social protection' arrived, followed by Parliament's contributions drawn up by Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk. Today, in examining Mr Andersson's report, I believe I can say that we have made great strides, given that we are now talking about modernising social protection. Secondly, we must take into account the legal basis on which the Commission can operate. As you know, the Treaty does not provide a legal basis for policies at European level, but there is a certain consensus, also expressed in the last Council, to undertake coordination actions and exchange of experiences between Member States on the most successful programmes. Thirdly, in the four areas on which the communication under consideration focuses, namely paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social inclusion and quality of health, there is a horizontal approach to the women's issue, given that in each of the four sections, as the honourable Members have pointed out, there are particular problems for women which, in many cases, should be addressed with different policies. My next point concerns the specific actions already undertaken. As we know, the Portuguese Presidency has already set up a high-level group, which will present its first report to the Summit next June. The Portuguese Presidency focuses on two issues: sustainable pension systems and social inclusion. I think that the proposal to set up a similar group at parliamentary level is very positive, because it could help to take a further step forward after the approval of its establishment. In response to many of your comments on the role of social protection systems and their cost, as well as the role that these systems play in the competitiveness of Member States, I would like to point out that policies seek to reconcile competitiveness with social cohesion in Europe. Competitiveness must certainly be taken into account, but we must also think about the planning of social protection, so as to transform it into a factor of economic growth and employment. I believe that this is clear in the communication. Ladies and gentlemen, in the coming years, once the unanimous approval of the Council has been obtained, the objective will be to reach a first level of coordination, exchange of views, identification of social problems and creation of a database for better coordination of policies. As many Members have pointed out, I believe that an important step has already been taken: at the IGC, social protection issues will be addressed in depth and we will enter a new phase, where social policy will become a truly European policy. Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30. WIPO Treaties The next item is the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)].	it
"Thank you very much, Mrs Schreyer. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. VOTES (Parliament approves the Commission proposal) Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE). Mr President, this is a point of order. I would like to ask for clarification regarding the Rules of Procedure: namely, Rules 133(2) and 133(4), both of which relate to voting. As regards votes other than roll-call votes, these are initially taken by show of hands, and only when certain doubts arise is electronic voting used. Is that correct? Indeed, dear colleague, I proceeded with a vote by show of hands, since no group had requested a roll-call vote. You know that a roll-call vote or electronic verification is only held if colleagues request it. In this case, I assure you that there was an overwhelming majority in favour of the directive we have just voted on. Mr President, I was not referring to this vote in particular, but to votes in general. It is obvious that some chairmen do not deal with the hands, so to speak, and proceed directly to the electronic vote. I wondered if this was the correct procedure. I know it takes longer, but should we not always vote by show of hands first? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to this second reading, the Commission can accept the only proposed amendment put forward by Parliament. The Commission takes up and accepts the proposed amendment. (The President declared the common position approved as amended) Report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (COM(1999)0158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) Report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission communication ""The Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund.

I have three points to make. The first is that a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament is essential. It is only six months since Amsterdam required our two institutions to work together; we have studied each other, we have had some small squabbles, but we really need to work together. Let us stop not taking things seriously. Let us abandon the elaborate charades and respect the duties that the Treaties impose on us and the time allowed for a truly democratic discussion. Involve us in your discussions on policy and the evolution of the process. Let us not pretend that national parliaments can exercise real democratic control over government activities in this area. My second point is that we need a Commission with adequate resources. We have set up a new Directorate-General, yet it only has 70 people in total. There is an agreement to double that number, but as far as I know no new resources have arrived so far. We are giving the Commission a very heavy task, not least that of drawing up the scoreboard. The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources the Commission needs. Finally, on the content of the debate, I welcome the fact that the Presidency has put the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of its agenda. Three seems to be the number that marks the good, especially in the area of European politics. Two hundred years ago it was about freedom, equality and fraternity and everything was fine until left-wing governments put equality above everything else. Now it is about freedom, security and justice, and I hope that the current left-wing governments will take Commissioner Vitorino's words into account and resist the temptation to elevate security, important as it is, above the equally important demands of freedom and justice. Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the Council representatives and the Commissioner. I thank them for their statements to the House. Rather than returning to the issues that have already been discussed, I would like to focus on one specific issue: the question of drugs and how we deal with the spread of drug culture in our societies. I hope in particular that the Portuguese Presidency will build on some of the enormous work done by the Finnish Presidency and come forward with coordinated plans and actions among Member States. At international level, there are already programmes to combat drug trafficking, money laundering and so on, but also, on a more human level, programmes to provide assistance to those seeking to free themselves from drug addiction, with adequate checks and mechanisms for rehabilitation; secondly, to ensure coordination between police forces and judicial systems on common laws and penalties; thirdly, to undertake an information and awareness-raising campaign for young people; and to put an end once and for all to the very dangerous terms of 'normalisation' and 'harm reduction' and to demonstrate that any weakening of our determination to prevent drugs from being legalised must be for the good of all.	it
In reality, the charge is about four times higher. The more remote the community, the greater the difference. This gives us an idea of the problem. It is not against liberalization to call for these factors to be taken into account and for the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service. On behalf of all our remote and island communities, wherever they may be in the European Union, and not just on behalf of the people of Scotland, I urge you to preserve the vital service that the postal service represents. Mr. President, I consider it a privilege to be representing my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, in such a high-level debate on postal services. I will endeavor, based on the information provided to me by Commissioner Bolkestein, to respond to the questions raised in the discussion. I would like to reiterate that Commissioner Bolkestein will be available to the Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on Monday. Some Members, such as Mr. Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal. Others believe that it is not a bad thing to have a short pause after the first liberalization step. Mr. Berthu, for example, shares this opinion. The Commission's position is that the delays surrounding the new proposal are mainly due to internal Commission problems, which Parliament may not be entirely unaware of. However, we believe there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be submitted. Commissioner Bolkestein intends to submit such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year. The planned deadline of 1 January 2003 for the implementation of the next steps remains feasible. The proposal will take into account the studies conducted and will examine, in particular, issues such as universal service, which I will return to shortly. As regards the current directive and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legislative measures to transpose it. A number of problems exist relating to the structure of the regulator and its independence. The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003. Further liberalization will follow thereafter. In some areas, such as parcel and express services, competition already exists. The quality of service has generally improved, particularly in cross-border transport. The quality of service, which is so important for consumers, was the main concern of all speakers, and some of them, like Mr. Rübig, were very clear on this issue. The experience of countries where liberalization is more advanced, such as Sweden, Finland, and the Netherlands, shows that, provided liberalization proceeds properly, the quality of service can actually improve as a result of the higher quality requirements imposed by national regulations and subsequent measures. There is therefore no sell-off of service and its quality. Liberalization often leads to guaranteed standards, and the ongoing standardization of service quality measurements also contributes to this, as these standards better reflect actual performance. This allows for meaningful benchmarking and, as a result of the combined pressure from regulators, competitors and customers, improved customer orientation by the responsible operator.	de
This system seems unsuitable for practical use. However, to compensate for this, all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued, and stricter conditions for issuing the service provision card must be met than those in the Commission's proposal. The requirements of legal employment, residence, and insurance coverage must be met not only at the time the card is issued, but also throughout the card's entire validity period and for three months thereafter. This should provide the receiving state with a guarantee that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state after completing their assignment and will be covered by insurance in the event of illness or accident. The entry and residence status should also be clarified before the service provision card is issued, within the framework of an appeal procedure. We propose that the EU service provision card not only must be applied for for all member states, but that it can also be applied for for individual member states. I believe that this system also better meets practical needs. I hope for the same from the proposal to reduce the minimum length of previous employment to three months and to base the validity of the service card more flexibly on the length of previous employment. However, we maintain that the maximum validity of the service card should be 12 months. For the self-employed, in addition to the changes already outlined, we propose that the residence criterion be tightened and that we provide a way to counteract possible abuse through bogus self-employment. I would also like to briefly address the amendments tabled, which go beyond those proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I would also like to say, of course, that I continue to support all of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which were adopted unanimously. I have myself tabled four amendments on behalf of my group, which essentially relate to the correct citation of a Council decision. I must say that I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament's services regarding how this Council decision should be correctly cited: only by the number, only by the date, or by both, as the Council decision is quoted in detail. Two amendments were cancelled by the services because their content was supposedly already taken into account in the report. I withdraw the two remaining amendments – Amendments 18 in the report on the self-employed and 21 on the employed. I can only appeal to the Conference of Presidents to reach an agreement as quickly as possible on the correct approach to the issue of comitology and how to cite correctly. That would make the lives of the rapporteurs in this House considerably easier in the future. There is also an amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio's reports. I regret to say that I cannot support this amendment because it fundamentally alters the result we reached unanimously in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and I would like to stick with the result we reached jointly in the Legal Affairs Committee after lengthy discussions. Finally, I would like to thank all my colleagues in the Legal Affairs Committee who supported me in these not-so-easy reports.	de
"But since 1997, no significant results have been achieved. So far, the Cologne Employment Pact has not been able to be filled with much substance. Furthermore, the European Parliament, as an equal partner, is missing from the macroeconomic dialogue. Indeed, the Luxembourg guidelines on employment policy have been implemented by the Member States only insufficiently in some areas, for example, in the area of lifelong learning, as the 1999 Joint Employment Report noted. Particularly in the area of information technology, some European countries lack a skilled workforce, as Mr. Souminen stated. Better than their ""imports"" from third countries are relevant investments in vocational training and further training, in human capital. This is the most effective way to combat unemployment. The most important objective of the Summit, namely, improving the competitiveness of the European economy, must be achieved as quickly as possible. The Ciampi Group also mentions the statute for the European public limited company in this context. It estimates that the absence of such a statute means an annual economic loss of 30 billion euros. We do not want the pure European public limited company. We need this European company, accompanied by minimum criteria for worker participation. Indeed, our political and social objective is not the pure market economy, but the social market economy as a European model. We should also measure the Lisbon Summit according to its contribution to achieving this objective. Mr. President of the Council, do you know how Archimedes expounded his theory of the lever? He said: ""Give me a fulcrum and I will lift the world."" It is obvious that, in Lisbon, you are trying to lift the world, or in any case a world that is ours: that of Europe. As for the lever, you described all its mechanisms through your proposal, which is fascinating and exciting in many respects. The fulcrum remains. The fulcrum is resources. Now, you are here before an Assembly in which several members are still living with the memory of what I would call the White Paper syndrome, that formidable initiative by Jacques Delors that crashed against the accountants of Ecofin. We would not want the same thing to happen to you today, because the project you are proposing to us is so stimulating that it can revitalize and give Europe the future our colleague Goebbels desires. But that requires resources, resources which, I fear, you still lack today. It is therefore up to you to create them. And, certainly, the straitjacket of Agenda 2000 will not provide you with the necessary means. Therefore, you will have to encourage your colleagues to secure funding for the proposals you are going to make to us. An example—and it is one of the important mechanisms you are proposing to us—is that of the information and knowledge society."	es
The agreement with Macedonia must be seen as an open door to the country's accession to the European Union, even if this is still a very long-term prospect. In the meantime, our policy must be to ensure that Macedonia's legislation begins to resemble that of the Member States, and our policy must reflect this fact even in the names of the aid programmes for Macedonia. I am thinking here of the PHARE programme. The name of the republic, Mr President, is still problematic because of Greek sensitivities. I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly free to use whatever name suits the republic in their own language. If some countries wish to keep the words former Yugoslavia, that is their business; others should not be obliged to do so. There is no question of constantly putting us under pressure. That is why I support Mr Swoboda's intelligent report; he has not accustomed us to anything else, and this also explains my laudatory words about the respectable Republic of Macedonia. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, allow me to say how much I personally appreciated the quality of the work of the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda. We are voting today in favour of opening negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia. We do so in the knowledge that this decision, the very first concerning the region, is part of a completely new phase in our relations with the Balkans. It is itself a factor in this new phase, or rather this new policy which, in the perspective of the European integration of the region, determines the only possibility of a peaceful settlement of the conflicts which are shaking the Balkans. Our agreement on the negotiating mandate stems, as the rapporteur explains in his explanatory memorandum, from the conviction that the Union's policy must be supplemented by either a regional dimension or a more specific valuation of the efforts and results of the individual countries on the path to integration of the acquis communautaire. It is this dual objective that, in my opinion, we must pursue: on the one hand, we must support programmes relating, for example, to infrastructure, prepare the stages for the introduction of free trade - even if this is premature - and encourage initiatives for economic and commercial cooperation between the countries of the region; on the other hand, we must now create with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia a model for a policy of closer integration. That said, we can only, for various reasons, express a favourable opinion. As our missions to Skopje, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, have observed, significant economic progress has been made in terms of democratic advances and, more delicate and difficult in this region, in the coexistence of several ethnic groups. Moreover, the country has paid a high price for the war in neighboring Kosovo, both in terms of logistical support for NATO forces and the decline in exports to northern Europe.	fr
"In this context, it is necessary to state very clearly which criteria should be used to select these rights. In my opinion, the essential criterion is the rights of citizens vis-à-vis the European institutions. These are the rights of citizens that flow from the European project enshrined in the Union Treaties. I understand your concern about children's rights. I believe that part of our work, and in particular my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, is to ensure children's rights. In doing so, we are operating in an area where the principle of subsidiarity fully applies. The primary responsibility for defining responsibilities towards children lies with the Member States. As regards the Union's responsibility as such, I believe that children's rights must be recognised in the Charter, taking into account the areas in which the Union can bring added value to improving the social, economic and, in the broadest sense, civic situation of children. I hope we will succeed in meeting the challenge that the Honourable Member has set before the Commission and the Convention as a whole. Mr President, I have had the honour of hearing the Commissioner speak on this subject several times today, and I can only agree with him. However, I would like to ask a slightly different question. We have just heard from Mr Barnier that he intends to improve communication with citizens and place the main issues that the Commission will be addressing this year at the heart of the Commission's information policy. Would the Commission support the allocation of part of the Commission's information budget to informing and consulting citizens on the subject of a Citizens' Charter? It is very important that citizens feel involved in this process. I know that the Convention itself will do a great deal in this area, but the resources available to the Commission are not the same. Could the Commission envisage using part of its information budget to involve citizens in this debate? The Commission pursues a policy of open and inclusive debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organizations, but also, given the far-reaching nature of this Charter, with all citizens. I can assure you that the Commission will do everything in its power to stimulate the debate on a future Charter of Fundamental Rights. The best solution would be a clearly worded text that is easy for citizens to understand and, at the same time, usable as a legal instrument. One does not exclude the other. The challenge is simply to shape the final version of the Charter so that it meets both requirements. I am very pleased that I can count on your support in this regard. Question No. 40 by (H-0095/00): Subject: Articles 6(1), 7(1), and 7(2) of the Treaty on European Union. Article 6(1) of the Treaty states: ""The Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law."" Jörg Haider and the FPÖ, as is clear from some of their statements in recent years, do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms as far as third-country nationals and minorities living in Austria are concerned."	de
It is limited to examining only three issues concerning the structure and functioning of just two institutions of the European Union – and that is not even an exhaustive one. Since they are well known to everyone, I hardly need mention them again. This statement is justified, on the one hand, by the demands in this regard made repeatedly and sometimes quite forcefully by European citizens, and, on the other, by the enormous scale of this enormous undertaking which the European Union has now embarked on with enlargement. In this respect, it is unacceptable that issues whose solution would ensure the smooth functioning of all, and not just certain, institutions of the European Union should be excluded from the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference. Consideration must also be given to the issues which concern and confront the citizens of Europe on a daily basis. The European Parliament has clearly expressed its support for the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference in many debates and in the reports submitted so far. At the same time, however, I call for issues that will improve and perfect the reform—I repeat—of all the institutions, as well as areas of direct concern and interest to European citizens, to be discussed there. These include, for example, health, energy, culture, transport, and tourism. Whether or not an expansion of the agenda will ultimately be implemented has not yet been decided. Let me take this opportunity to truly commend the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, for it has repeatedly committed itself to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts in this regard. On the other hand, the question of whether further points are included should in no way diminish the importance that each individual Member State must attach to the Intergovernmental Conference. The institutional framework for the future of Europe is, in fact, a fundamental principle of European integration and therefore a matter of the utmost national importance for every Member State of the Union. I therefore ask this House to approve the opinion presented to you by Mr Leinen and myself, so that the Intergovernmental Conference can open on 14 February and our two representatives at that Conference, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can, with the European Parliament's approval, begin the difficult task that awaits them there. The same applies to the European Commission, and I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier once again for his cooperation with the European Parliament and his extremely constructive proposals. Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party was not satisfied with the outcome of the Helsinki European Council. The agenda seemed too short to us because our group placed itself in the logic of the Treaty and, more specifically, in the Protocol on the Union's institutions. In Helsinki, governments confirmed that a mini-reform was sufficient as long as the European Union consisted of fewer than 21 Member States, whereas with more members, a more far-reaching reform was necessary. The same Helsinki European Council approved enlargement to include 13 new Member States. Thus, there is an inconsistency between the opening of accession negotiations with 13 states and the desire for a mini-reform. We, however, continue to follow the logic of the Treaty and want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a more profound reform of the Union.	de
Is it conceivable to apply a tax base based on the equivalent of alcohol? The question of excise duties, to which the Honourable Member refers, is a matter for the Member States concerned. The Commission has no means of imposing a reduction or increase in excise duties on alcoholic beverages or other products. The Commission will present a report on excise duty differentials between Member States towards the end of the year. There is no doubt that such a report will give rise to a discussion with both Parliament and the Council, given the substantial differences in the level of excise duty rates between Member States. For example, I believe the Honourable Member was referring to this point, in France there is no excise duty on wine, whereas in the United Kingdom there is, which distorts the single market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom. The question specifically concerned the relationship between excise duties and the alcohol content of goods subject to excise duty. The Commission has no means of intervening. In the case of Sweden, excise duties are indeed used to reduce alcohol consumption. Although this leads to a disparity in excise duties between Sweden and the other Member States of the Union - and this in turn increases cross-border smuggling of alcohol - it is a legitimate instrument to reduce alcohol consumption. Of course there is also the elasticity of demand, in our case the price elasticity of demand. I am not sure what the value is, but it is not equal to zero and therefore has an effect. My question would have been practically the same as that of Mr Purvis, but I will insist. Given that, as you say, excise duties are a prerogative of the Member States, using that prerogative in a way that unfairly discriminates against producers in one region of the Community compared with others could still conflict with the principle of the single market. Returning to the example of Mr Purvis, and I am thinking in particular of malt whiskey production in the Highlands - a very depressed, remote region of Europe, with a whole farming community dependent on it as well as the distillery sector - the widespread practice of imposing higher excise duties on the alcohol contained in Scotch whiskey, Dutch gin or Danish brandy than on the alcohol contained in beer or wine seems to me to be discrimination and a discriminatory use of a power which is clearly the prerogative of the Member States. I can confirm to Mr MacCormick and the other Members that the current situation, namely the existence of different excise duties between Member States, is indeed not conducive to the proper functioning of the single market. We must not limit ourselves to alcoholic beverages alone. In the case of petrol, for example, excise duties in Germany are different from those in the Netherlands and as a result Dutch motorists cross the border to fill up in Germany. This is clearly a distortion of the internal market.	it
Although the civil war in Cambodia is over and the political situation has eased, the way in which the political opposition is now being treated fills us with great concern. If this continues, there must be consequences for the Union's relations with Cambodia. Mr President, a new doctrine is currently gaining ground in international law, according to which no state may treat its citizens and those living within its territory as it pleases, and state sovereignty does not constitute an obstacle to external intervention in cases of gross human rights violations, even if the government itself was legally or even democratically elected. Evocative examples of this are the Pinochet-Ugarte case, the Kosovo conflict, and, to a lesser extent, the debate within the Union's own ranks about the formation of a government in Austria. The same danger now exists in Cambodia if the former leadership of the violent regime cannot be held legally accountable. At the same time, the fight against impunity, the impunity of those responsible, is being jeopardized. This situation should also remind us that the ratification of the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court is progressing extremely slowly. Mr President, we had a very useful debate on human rights yesterday. I am pleased that this has provided another opportunity to highlight a number of areas in the world—Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya, and Cambodia—where the protection of human rights poses a particularly great challenge. First, Kosovo. The Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in the draft resolutions regarding the general policy towards Kosovo, the ongoing ethnic violence, and the prisoners in Serbian penitentiaries. Our efforts in Kosovo and the wider region are directed toward short- and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilization. We support, in particular, the emergence of a free, democratic, and multi-ethnic society. Our assistance programs in the areas of democratization and human rights should be continued in order to build trust in general and, in particular, to build trust between the various communities. We have consistently condemned ethnic violence, regardless of the ethnic group at stake or victim. We consider it just as unacceptable against the Serb and Roma minorities as we considered it unacceptable against the Kosovo Albanians in the past. We support the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR, and the OSCE to establish a functioning civilian administration and to ensure law and order. In this context, we strongly support the High Representative's recent appeal to Member States to contribute more police officers to the UN civilian police mission in Kosovo. This point was raised by several speakers during the debate. I hope this makes it clear that, in developing a common foreign and security policy, we must address both the non-military and the military aspects of that policy. We must have clear objectives for our oversight and institution-building, but it is equally important that we have clear objectives for a military capacity. We remain deeply concerned that so many civilians are currently being held in Serbian prisons awaiting trial or following conviction.	de
My answer is perhaps unsatisfactory at this time, but I would like to assure you that the Commission will make that decision within a matter of weeks. I ask for your understanding for this slight delay in the Commission's decision. Commissioner, do you have any reason, for reasons of public health, to make a difference in the tax rates applied, for example, to Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine, or even to my colleague's Bavarian beer? Is it possible to provide for the application of an equivalent base for alcoholic beverages in the European tax system? The issue of excise duties, to which you refer, is a prerogative of the Member State concerned. The Commission does not have the instruments to apply an increase or reduction in excise duties on alcoholic products or any other product. Towards the end of this year, the Commission will present a report on the differences that exist between Member States regarding excise duties. The report will undoubtedly trigger a debate with Parliament and the Council on the current situation, which reflects the existence of significant differences between Member States regarding excise rates. For example, in France—and I believe this is what the honourable Member was referring to—wine is exempt from excise duty, while in the United Kingdom it is not. This creates a distortion of the internal market, leading to the smuggling of French wine into the United Kingdom. The issue relates specifically to the relationship between excise duty and the alcohol content of products subject to excise duty. The Commission has no means at its disposal to intervene in this area. In the case of Sweden, the instrument of excise duty is used to curb alcohol consumption. Although this practice results in inequalities in excise duty between Sweden and other EU Member States—which in itself increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products—it is a legitimate instrument for reducing alcohol consumption. There is, of course, elasticity of demand, in this case, a price elasticity of demand. I'm not quite sure what it is exactly, but it's not zero, so it must have repercussions. My question would have been almost identical to the one asked by Mr. Purvis, but I would like to press the issue a little further. Agreed, as you say, excise duties are part of the prerogatives of the Member States. However, using that prerogative in a way that unfairly discriminates against producers in one part of the Community compared to those in others could infringe the principle of the single market. For example, if we take the case that Mr. Purvis and I were thinking of, that of the Highlands where malt whisky is produced - a very peripheral area of Europe which is in a difficult situation, where an entire farming community as well as the distilling community depends on whisky - the general practice of taxing alcohol - Scotch whisky, Dutch gin or Danish aquavit - at a higher rate than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine - seems to me to be discrimination and a discriminatory use of something which, I recognize, is part of the prerogatives of Member States.	es
Next week I'm going to the Bundestag in Berlin. I've already been to the French Senate. So, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I'll also go directly to see the national representatives. This dialogue with citizens is not about propaganda, publicity, or even communication. I would like it to be a real dialogue, and after the screening of a short film in which the imperatives of institutional reform are objectively explained, those present here in the galleries can intervene and respond with an open microphone. We are going to carry out—I repeat—this initiative for dialogue in sporadic or structured cooperation with the Member States, and I ardently hope that the governments of the Fifteen, with the support of the honourable Members, will participate, according to the modalities they consider most appropriate and suitable, in this initiative for dialogue. Mr. President, I would like to join Mr. Barnier's study group of 700 interns so that I have someone to debate with. It's not very fun having to discuss the Governmental Conference and transparency with oneself. Regarding the Governmental Conference, Mr. Barnier said during his presentation in Parliament that social policy was not subject to majority decisions. However, looking at page 63, I see that the fight against discrimination, the right of free movement and establishment—that is, the residence directives—all social security, the renewal of Regulation No. 1408, and measures in the area of social policy—with a few exceptions—will be subject to qualified majority voting. Does Mr. Barnier have no qualms about touching the backbone of the electoral processes in member countries with this? These are the issues that drive people to the polls and lead to a new majority in the Danish Parliament and other parliaments. Can they be regulated from Brussels? Is this part of the radical decentralization process that Mr. Prodi spoke about this morning? I was very pleased to learn last week that the Commission will be paying special attention for several years to the concept of subsidiarity, and its reference not only to relations between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Union, the Member States, the regions, and the cities. I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue for Europe's regions, Commissioner Barnier will delve deeper into this thinking and learn from what he hears. Commissioner, I refer to one of your answers to previous questions in which you mentioned what I call the possibilities of closing the Treaty in the face of risks of deviation and, in particular, the diversification of the sanctions that can be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for violations of fundamental freedoms. Do you believe that such proposals or proposals of that nature can be part of the mandate of the IGC, as formulated in Helsinki? For my part, I do not think so. Aren't you afraid that such sanctions will be misdirected and not serve to punish human rights violations, but rather simple disagreements, crimes of opinion, or divergences from mainstream European thinking?	es
Finally, they reiterated, in contemporary terms, the proposals in President Delors' White Paper for promoting a European project aimed at achieving a unified network of infrastructure and services. These suggestions, which largely coincide with the guidelines of the Portuguese Presidency's programmatic document, which will therefore be debated at the Lisbon Summit, have been rejected and distorted within this Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs by a majority that has been able to find its precarious unity only in its ideological aversion to a European Union based on the convergence of national policies and not solely on an assembly of markets. This Parliament, Mr. President, which has on numerous occasions demonstrated a strong pro-European vocation, must demonstrate in this circumstance that it can express a majority in favor of a political union of Europe, capable of confronting the weaknesses and failures of the markets. Mr. President, Mr. Katiforis's report is interesting. In its original version, it shows the path toward a renewed economic policy, which aims for more than just cuts and balance. The EU is in a position where we can achieve high growth and seriously combat unemployment, without jeopardizing objectives such as price stability and a balanced budget. It is therefore regrettable that the EPP-ED and ELDR voted in committee against the proposal that addressed the serious fight against unemployment. The debate and vote here in plenary should correct this. However, it is gratifying that unity has been achieved on some strategic proposals, namely that the Union's economic policy should prioritize investments, among other things, to integrate all citizens of the Union into the information society, something that can also have great economic significance. I also think that the trans-European network connections must be strengthened so that they reach the candidate countries, both with regard to physical transport and IT infrastructure. This is important for growth, but also for avoiding differences between people, both within the EU and vis-à-vis the candidate countries. The candidate countries must not be left behind; part of the project must be for the EU to become a global pioneer in the field of communications. This requires society to assume responsibility for the rapid and energetic construction of modern information technology infrastructures that reach small businesses, poor regions, and ordinary citizens. Now is our opportunity; let's seize it! Mr. President, the advantage of speaking at the end of a debate is that we can object to what has been said before. I would like to say that I completely disagree with Mrs. Villiers about this being such an interesting debate. I believe that the European Parliament is doing a great disservice by dwelling only on outdated concepts and expressing outdated political currents and ideas.	es
This is the only time I've spoken about it. But today I have to do so, and I do so from the heart. I was born in Germany, Madam President, I was educated in Sweden, and I married a Spaniard. I know what democracy is because I had the advantage of growing up in a country like Sweden, which had a long democratic tradition. I came to the Basque Country with all my goodwill for integration, and despite what has happened to me, I remain convinced that one day the Basque Country will have the desired peace, because to those who think there is conflict in the Basque Country, I say that the only conflict the Basque Country has is called ETA, and it must disappear. We'll talk about the rest. (Loud and prolonged applause) We democrats will resolve the rest by expressing all our ideas, because there is freedom of expression in the Basque Country, there is freedom to vote, there is freedom. The only thing that restricts this freedom is ETA. Let ETA disappear, and let the democrats speak. (Loud applause) I thank you, Mrs. Dührkop Dührkop, and express my sympathy and respect. Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting. The minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments? We are about to consider the matter of Committee reform, and as you will recall, Madam President, at the beginning of the last part-session, I raised the question of whether, in the interests of transparency, the register of Members' interests could be made more widely available to the public by publishing it on the Internet. You promised Parliament that you would raise this matter with the Quaestors that evening. I would like to know if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament whether the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and, if so, whether you will personally set them a deadline—perhaps April 1—for doing so. Ladies and gentlemen, the Bureau has expressed its agreement in principle to include online registration of the register in which Members must declare their financial interests, but the Quaestors are still reflecting on the legal issues that this entails. We will have a decision very soon. (The Minutes were approved) Reform of the Commission. The next item is the Commission's communication on the reform of the European Commission. I now give the floor to Mr. Romano Prodi. (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here before you, I solemnly undertook the commitment to reform the Commission. I would like to briefly recall what happened last July: after the crisis at the previous Commission, I had just been appointed, and you ratified that appointment for the first time. The culminating moment of that episode was my commitment to reform the Commission: a major reform that must bring about a true revolution in the way the Commission works.	es
In that sense, we believe we fully respect what we concluded. I simply ask the Commission, before implementing the second tranche, to report to the Committee on Budgets. I fully agree, and we will do so. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:00. ALTENER The next item is the report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr. Langen on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD)) adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community. Mr. President, I would like to thank Mr. Langen—although he is not present—for the work he has done to ensure that this programme is approved both in Parliament and in the Council. This project has been long and complicated. In the future, research aimed at determining the use of renewable energy sources must also continue to be significantly encouraged. While this new directive has many strengths, it also has many flaws. For example, the absence of bog peat in the directive. Peat should not be classified in the same group as fossil fuels. If peat cannot be directly included among renewable energies, among non-fossil energy sources, then it should be considered as a specific group, especially when it comes to applying an environmental tax. It is unfair for peat to be assessed using the same indicators as, for example, hard coal. The development of renewable energy sources is part of the range of solutions to end the Union's dependence on imported energy. Research also plays a key role in the framework of the next round of negotiations for EU enlargement. Dependence on imported energy most severely affects some Eastern European countries, whose economic infrastructure is still subject to the dependence on Russian energy that was created during the Soviet era. The EU adheres to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. We are all concerned about the environment and the future of our children. We must increase the share of renewable energy sources in the bulk of energy production, but this must also be done in a rational manner. We must remember that it will take a long time before we are in a position to build our energy production base solely on renewable energy sources. And for this, we will need climate-neutral energy: nuclear energy. Mr. President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I am pleased that we have achieved a result in the conciliation procedure on the ALTENER II program. First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Langen, for the excellent work he has done on this report. I would also like to thank the head of the delegation to the Conciliation Committee, Mr. Provan, because, as Mr. Langen has already pointed out, the fight in the Conciliation Committee has been tough. However, today we can see that the outcome of the conciliation clearly bears the stamp of the European Parliament.	es
Perhaps before we direct our criticisms at people outside Parliament, we should do some soul-searching to really understand what we are doing. Mr President, I will not use my speaking time to deal with the individual cases that we are dealing with today. I agree with Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel that we cannot discuss them in detail. Perhaps next time we should talk about CORUS, the merger between Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel. I would like to put the discussion in a slightly broader context, looking at the relationship between EU policy in the field of corporate mergers and policy in other areas. In this respect, I am pleased that Commissioner Liikanen is here and that we can have this debate, which concerns workers' interests, not only with Commissioner Diamantopoulou, but also with Commissioners responsible for other sectors. Unlike the previous speaker, who assumes that there should be no rules, I would like to call for greater coherence in the Commission's policy in this area, taking into account the different perspectives. We need to develop a view that takes into account the reality of business. We are currently witnessing the emergence of numerous large mergers between companies with an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with ties to the Rhine tradition. In this context, what remains of the concept of what a company should be is of enormous importance, i.e. whether it represents exclusively a property in the hands of shareholders or whether it constitutes a broader stakeholder society, aimed both at ensuring a certain continuity for workers, consumers, suppliers and the local population, and at fulfilling a social function. I therefore call on the Directorates-General of the Commission and the various Commissioners to develop a broader vision of corporate government. I think this would be highly appropriate in view of the programmes presented in recent days on good government in Europe, of which corporate policy is also a part. In Italy too, the government is meeting with a delegation of trade unions and Goodyear delegates to try to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally decided by the North American multinational in an area of central Italy, Cisterna di Latina, already affected by other restructurings. The closure means the loss of more than a thousand jobs, both direct and indirect, hundreds of families left to insecurity and new poverty. Goodyear workers are leading an exemplary fight, with the awareness that they are not only defending their interests but also those of Goodyear workers in various European countries, and there are many of them: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia. Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to understand what their future will be and what solidarity the European Union will offer, what policy it will adopt to prevent multinationals from acting solely and exclusively in their market and profit interests. Goodyear, like other multinationals, has received more than 166 billion. The European Union, in all its instances, must exercise all its power to ensure that these and other disputes are resolved.	it
Question Time to the Commission is closed. (The sitting, suspended at 7:30 p.m., resumed at 9:00 p.m.) Community water policy (continued) The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading on Community water policy. Mr President, the freshwater situation in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world, but, in general terms, it is a fact that demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decline. Added to this are the water pollution problems affecting the potential new Member States in the East. Has not a tank containing cyanide just burst in Romania, threatening the aquifers that supply the people of Yugoslavia? I understand that Mrs Wallström, whom I thank very much for being here this evening, will be visiting the region. I believe that no country, no government, and, of course, no Member of this Parliament can deny the need for this directive to put an end to the fragmentation currently characterizing water policy and facilitate the implementation of a program of measures specific to each river basin. The gestation has been difficult and complex; the interests at stake are multiple and opinions divided. I have no doubt that the rapporteur in this legislature, Mrs. Lienemann, has made a great effort and spent a lot of time reconciling and conciliating positions, and she has largely succeeded. However, knowing and correctly assessing all the situations and perspectives is an almost impossible task. I come from a country whose southern half looks out onto the Mediterranean, and where water availability has historically responded to the whims of a changing climate and a difficult terrain. The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development, trying to overcome this adversity century after century, year after year, and day after day, right up to the present day. This is why the practical application of the directive to the obligation, contained in Article 164 of the Treaty, that Community legislation must take into account the diversity of its regions, seems essential to us. Precisely in application of this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People's Party will oppose Amendments 4 (recital 21), 13 and 49 (Article 11, letter d) because they imply a serious limitation in an area of exclusive management by the Member States, such as the regulation of their water resources. The Community would find it very difficult to determine the conditions for its regulation in the different regions, given the different internal balances that are always at stake and which in any case require a thorough knowledge of the different areas and interests concerned. Likewise, we reject the amendments that seek to include the total cost of water for 2010. We must unquestionably set water prices that encourage its efficient use but, at the same time, allow the competitiveness of production sectors in the most disadvantaged regions to be maintained and do not prevent their legitimate development.	fr
Will you include it in the work of your audit committee? Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based and accountability-based budgeting, and, as Mr. Prodi says, you will be judged by your actions, not your words. This item is closed. I thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock. Statement by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The next item is the statement by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. I have the pleasure of extending a warm welcome to Mr. Javier Solana, to whom I immediately give the floor. Madam President, as you can imagine, it is a great pleasure for me to be with you again here in the European Parliament. Since the last time, ladies and gentlemen, that I appeared before you to address you on issues related to foreign and security policy on our continent, many things have happened. Sometimes we would think that too much has happened. This afternoon, I would like to share some thoughts with you, primarily on the Common Foreign and Security Policy. It is true, as I have said, that the world has moved a great deal in recent months and a number of events have taken place, but I will leave it until the question and answer period to address any of the questions you may have. Over the past few months, since I last appeared before you, important events have taken place here, including in the European Union. Allow me to remind you of two. One is very dear to all of you, Members of Parliament, and especially to the Presidency: the inauguration of the Intergovernmental Conference and the opening of negotiations with the future members of the European Union. Undoubtedly, the events in Kosovo and in the Balkans in general have stirred all our hearts and minds; important issues in the Middle East, where the President of Parliament played an important role on her recent trip; Some important events to unblock the summit between Europe and Africa, in which I had the pleasure of participating in cooperation with the Portuguese Presidency; the major meeting that took place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen Latin American countries to try to build a deeper relationship between the European Union and the countries of Latin America. Chechnya has undoubtedly also been close to our hearts, and I will have the opportunity to say a few words at the end of my speech, following an important conversation I had this morning with the representative of the Council of Europe, Mr. Álvaro Gil-Robles, about his recent visit to the region. But I understand that you have asked me to appear here to speak to you more directly about foreign policy and, above all, about security policy in Europe after Helsinki. I will refer to that briefly; if you would be kind enough to ask questions during the question period, I will be happy to answer them. Let me remind you that the summit under the Finnish Presidency in Helsinki took place not a century ago, but barely two months ago. Fundamental decisions for our continent's foreign and security policy were made in Helsinki.	es
"While restructuring to improve competitiveness and gain market share is laudable from an economic point of view, such a measure can be reprehensible if it is carried out at the request of financiers, who are often shareholders, for the sole, unacknowledged purpose of increasing the value of these companies in order to generate greater profits. The various recent announcements mentioned by my colleagues, whether by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this regard. In my view, rationalization of management and improved results must primarily serve the company and, therefore, its employees, although this may also have financial repercussions. Today, a process of mergers and acquisitions and of production relocations is underway, with their well-known effects on product quality, as well as their dramatic social repercussions on a human level, especially for the family as the core unit of society, notably unemployment, more difficult working conditions, and greater flexibility. There is therefore a grave danger of our planet becoming divided: on the one hand, the poor countries that supply labor, and on the other, the rich countries that provide capital. Shouldn't Europe offer protection to maintain a certain balance between greater profitability and social well-being? We should not forget that human capital is the foundation of a company's operation, ensuring its good results. Finally, I would like to point out that the third letter in the name of the group to which I belong means ""difference."" Europe has the task of raising its voice as an alternative to purely profit-driven, unregulated restructuring, pointing in a different direction in this single stream of restructuring. Mr President, in one of my neighboring regions, last month the Michelin Group announced large-scale layoffs at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to the company's restructuring and increasing global competition in the world tire market. Like all the Members present, I am saddened by this loss of jobs. I am equally saddened by Goodyear's announcement, which prompted this resolution. However, I very much doubt whether a European Works Council would have been able to change that company's decision. This House is indeed very good at drafting resolutions and laws, and sometimes we in this institution forget that Europe cannot survive alone. We need multinational companies that have their business base on our continent. After the few months I have been here, I find it astonishing that while we all talk about the need to encourage business growth in the EU, almost every resolution we pass actually causes companies to leave. At our last plenary session in Brussels, we voted on the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive and passed a retroactive law that will impose huge additional costs on European motor vehicle manufacturers that they could not have foreseen. Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, announced that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could also mean redundancies at its Derbyshire factory. In a world where less regulation is certainly crucial, we in this House seem to believe that we can impose more regulation and more costs on companies and that they will remain in the European Union without being tempted to move to other locations with less burden."	de
We cannot therefore say that we are completely dissatisfied with what has been achieved. Of course, it is always better to have more resources available - I will continue to insist on this point - and more quickly. However, I believe that this programme offers good prospects for many others. I would like to point out that culture is not financed exclusively from this fund. Culture is not only included in the chapter that bears this name, but falls within many other areas. Significant resources for culture are also available within the Structural Funds, an aspect that we must take into account and highlight. Fortunately for me, I am a member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and therefore I will work to ensure that this aspect receives the attention it deserves. I also believe that it has been decided to support the position according to which the planned budget is sufficient. In fact, if the proposed changes do not come to fruition, the citizens will pay the consequences. I have always supported the rapporteur from this point of view. However, I believe that it is necessary, as the rapporteur reiterates, to arrive at a change in the codecision procedure within the IGC. In this case, unanimity will no longer be necessary. We view the many improvements that have been made very positively. There is no longer any talk of mega-projects, space is being made for cultural networks, and attention is being shifted to promoting reading and translations, which are very important issues for the smaller language areas. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and Mrs Reding on this text on CULTURE 2000. Now I can only say: let us get to work. Madam President, the honourable Members who preceded me have already covered all my points and I believe that there is consensus among the parliamentary groups and among the members of the Committee on Culture. I must say that, reluctantly, I too will vote in favour of the draft joint decision of the Council and Parliament. I say reluctantly because of the unacceptable attitude of the Council and not because our delegation, the rapporteur and President Gargani have not done a very good job - quite the opposite - or because I have objections to the position taken by Commissioner Reding, who has adopted a very positive attitude given the margins at her disposal. Shame! An allocation of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union! We are literally forced to humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, pioneers of the arts and literature, giving a sop to one and failing thirty others, and we offer the image of a Europe that is alien, hostile, hostile and opposed to any attempt at cultural activity, when in fact the Union should not be absent. Such a conclusion is truly painful, given that our future is not only made up of euros, enlargements or geostrategic conveniences, but we must also ensure cultural growth for European unification. There will be no progress as long as we maintain the principle of unanimity, according to which yesterday the Netherlands imposed its ultimatum of 167 million euros and tomorrow the Haider government will tell us which cultural activities should be supported.	it
Parks have been set up all over the place, which are a key element of the LIFE programme. The fact remains that these parks, built with little financial resources and without signage, have no effect and serve no purpose. I therefore call on Parliament and the Commission to give this matter the attention it deserves. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the beginning of 1999, discussions have been taking place between the institutions on the proposed regulation concerning a third stage for the environmental instrument - LIFE. I would like once again to congratulate the Committee on the Environment and Mrs Lienemann on the excellent and constructive cooperation we have had on this matter. Thanks to this cooperation, I can confirm that the Commission can accept in full or in principle nine of the fourteen amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment. The Commission approves, above all, Amendments 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, relating to comitology procedures. Parliament has, in this case, fully taken into account the Commission's objections to the common position. The Commission can also approve Amendment 4 in principle, although it must be introduced in a different way into the text. Regarding Amendments 5 and 6, I would like to point out that the project for the sustainable use of groundwater and surface water, as well as the project to limit atmospheric pollutants that contribute to the greenhouse effect, are largely covered by LIFE. However, the Commission believes that mentioning this separately runs counter to the initial decision to focus the proposal on a few priority points. There is also a risk of overlap with other Community programmes such as the Fifth Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities. The key measures in this programme – water quality, the city of tomorrow and innovative products and processes – partly cover the same topics. As for the budget, I welcome the confidence shown by the Environment Committee. Amendment 12 proposes a larger budget than that set out in the common position. I am also convinced that LIFE has enormous potential. This instrument could finance good projects with appropriations greater than those mentioned in the budget proposal. The amount set out in Amendment 12, however, is not in line with the budget plan drawn up on the basis of Agenda 2000. Let me also add that if the budget is increased, it is clear that the Environment Directorate will also be required to handle an increasing number of projects. Other programmes must also be taken into account, for which decisions must be taken under the codecision procedure. The Commission is, at this stage, sticking to the amount set out in the common position. As regards Amendment 3, which we did not adopt at first reading, I would like to point out that each programme has its own objectives, eligible costs and requests.	fr
This applies to the minimum rights laid down in the Treaty, to safeguarding the free movement of workers—while simultaneously preserving social rights—and it also applies to economic coordination and cooperation. We therefore need coordination and cooperation, but convergence should be sought in terms of objectives, not means. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Jan Andersson, for his very constructive efforts to reconcile differing opinions and for supporting his report. I personally support the report, but I am critical of certain points. For example, I do not support the demand that the Commission take action against so-called unfair competition between social and tax systems if such intervention is to be used to stifle innovative thinking, development, and more effective design of our social systems, or to prevent the reduction of excessive tax burdens in many EU countries. I reject detailed Commission regulations on the extent and quality of childcare or elderly care, and I am skeptical about setting a value for a common poverty line. The coordination of social policy and dialogue is good. However, we should not treat everyone according to the same pattern; there must be room for a variety of possible solutions. Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make some positive comments on the modernization of social protection outlined here, but I would also like to point out problem areas. I welcome the fact that this dossier is slowly but surely moving forward. I consider that to be correct and useful. I am also positive about the guidelines of the communication, the strategy. Hopefully, the four objectives identified therein can then be reasonably achieved. We would also like to underline the importance of the way in which we are tackling the problem: on the one hand, the Luxembourg-style process, guidelines. But we also need, for example, as Mrs van Lancker has already pointed out, guidelines for atypical work, for the self-employed without employees, etc. Nevertheless, two problems are likely to arise for which we must find solutions. Firstly, the level of social protection is being lowered where we hope for convergence at a level. Let me cite a few examples from a recent study conducted by Dutch trade unions on the impact of reforms in the European Union on social protection. According to this study, convergence is taking place everywhere. Many, indeed most, of the convergence is clearly downward, while the rest are improvements. Most adjustments relate to pensions: eleven reductions and two improvements. Regarding unemployment benefits, we observe six deteriorations and five improvements. The convergence is due, for example, to the promotion of employment and the reduction of social spending, but also to competition and the EMU criteria. This political competition is primarily found in the northern countries. The most secure social protection and even improvements are observed in the southern countries. All in all, the influence of the social partners in this entire process is likely to decline. That is not encouraging, and therefore the convergence strategy should be based on the best approaches. Cappuccino, to put it that way, does not always do us good. Mr President, Now, for my part, I would like to congratulate the Commission and the rapporteur. The Commission for taking another step toward social protection convergence, and the rapporteur for delivering an excellent report.	de
Social integration, which requires a firm commitment in economic, political, and social terms on the part of the responsible authorities, is the only way to prevent these events from recurring in places where there are already large communities of immigrant workers. We are all immigrants. For generations, human beings have not always remained within the borders of a nation state. There have been constant migratory flows. Geographical mobility is not a 20th-century invention, nor are their economic and labor reasons. We are all immigrants, whether personally or through a member of our family or one of our ancestors. However, instead of being the cause of events that we condemn here, these migratory flows must generate social, cultural, and economic enrichment. We believe that what happened in El Ejido, which unfortunately is not exclusive to this locality in the European Union, requires, first of all, the clear and unequivocal condemnation of the brutal racist and xenophobic outburst by some residents of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area, blaming, criminalizing and attacking an entire community for an isolated incident that we all regret. Secondly, it requires immediate action from all administrations; coordination between them is essential in order to combat this type of xenophobic and racist acts. More specifically, local authorities, mayors, have a direct responsibility in preventing any racist or xenophobic manifestation, even more so when it involves violent events against people and their property. These authorities also have the obligation to promote difficult agreements between the parties involved and not to prevent them, as is the case with the mayor of El Ejido. Thirdly, this requires that political parties assume direct responsibility in the political exercise of their public functions and prevent any individual act or statement that is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union. Finally, it requires the European Union to be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles, preserving its territory from any manifestations of a racist or xenophobic nature, and to support and collaborate with the rest of the national, regional and local administrations, as well as with associations and non-governmental organizations, in the application of these principles and in the context of ongoing action to combat racism and xenophobia and promote the integration of all immigrants residing in the territory of the European Union. Mr President, initially, our group did not see the need to present this proposal because it appeared to be a local phenomenon. However, the events in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon that is sweeping across the whole of Europe and deserves the greatest attention. We thought we were rid of the horror of intolerance that racism had unleashed in Europe, but as the years go by, why not say it? The social degradation in our Europe is combined with the increase in migratory flows from the countries around us and a greater awareness of human rights, and this climate of racism and intolerance is increasing. That is why what seemed to be a local phenomenon - in El Ejido - is becoming a worrying symptom that coincides with the rise of parties like Haider's. That is why we are proposing, from the European Parliament, the adoption of urgent measures that address all the factors involved and that are immediately applicable: respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism, the increase of budgets and lines of action in social and health matters.	fr
"The question, Your Honor, is one that we must all ask ourselves, and I recently did so diplomatically. It concerns the very consistency of Security Council resolution 12/99. I know it is an extraordinarily delicate issue, but we must all question the logic underlying that resolution and the possibility of its implementation. We are in favor of its full and complete implementation. However, we must examine that resolution—and this is probably something the United Nations Security Council will have to do, sooner or later—in the sense that, as has happened in the past in other global strategic frameworks and scenarios, we can examine whether or not certain types of procedures and certain types of logic and balances should be maintained in the future, which, moreover, were the logic and balances that led to the adoption of the resolution. What we must do, what we are doing on behalf of the European Union, is to guarantee Mr. Kouchner every means, and the Honorable Member is right: we have an obligation, before our citizens, to explain regularly and clearly to what extent these means are being used appropriately or not. For the Council, we intend to provide information on this during the Portuguese Presidency. Mr. President-in-Office of the Council, I fully agree with you. The problem is not Mr. Kouchner, but the legal basis on which he works, namely, Resolution 1244. That said, I believe that the Union's responsibility—yours, but also ours—is to begin working to overcome this provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and imagine a future scenario for the entire region. I believe that it is the lack of definition of this scenario that causes or encourages the excesses, the accidents, the murders that Mr. Alavanos has spoken of. Does the Council intend to raise the issue of Kosovo's final status? And if so, does it intend to do so through a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-states, as some have a tendency to do, and reuniting the parts, in this case, Kosovo and Albania? Since its author is not present, question 7 falls. Question 8 by (H-0796/99): Subject: New INTERREG initiative. In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft communication on INTERREG entitled ""Promoting urban, rural and coastal development"", the Commission authorizes the renewal and development of historic town centres through a joint cross-border strategy, from which, however, housing is expressly excluded. Given the high number of historic buildings in rural areas, including small cottages, and the need, for various reasons, to maintain the population of rural areas and attract new residents, does the Council not believe that these objectives could be achieved by funding housing projects in the areas covered by INTERREG? Mr. President, the Council—and we could even say the Portuguese Presidency in particular—is acutely aware of the importance of the problems addressed by the honourable Member in his question, and I would like to emphasize that we always devote our full attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas."	es
"It has been demonstrated, as we have been denouncing since 1995, that this transfer is absurd. We think it is right that Portugal and France want to reach an agreement, but those anchovies must be fished in Portuguese waters and not in the Bay of Biscay. Today, scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay is in danger of extinction. And now here come the measures to restrict the quantity of anchovies that can be fished in the Bay of Biscay. I do not know whether you have realised the responsibility that, as a Council of Ministers, you have had in recent years, and that you will have in 2000, towards the thousands of families who live from anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. I would like to point out, Honourable Member, that in its ruling of 5 October 1999 the Court of Justice of the European Communities decided that this transfer, which had been approved, was in accordance with the principles laid down in Council Regulation No 1073/2001. 3760/92, and in particular in paragraph 1 of Article 9, which provides that Member States may exchange all or part of the fishing availabilities allocated to them. The Court also held that the principle of relative stability had not been infringed, since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in subdivision 8 was maintained at 90 per cent and that of France at 10 per cent. Furthermore, Honourable Member, the Court is of the opinion that the transfer between Portugal and France does not infringe the principle of rational and responsible exploitation of living marine and aquatic resources, since fishing pressure in subdivisions 8 and 9 does not increase or adversely affect the overall share of resources allocated to Spain. In view of all this, Honourable Member, the Council reiterates that without the transfer in question, an increase in the fishing possibilities for anchovy by France in the Bay of Biscay should be considered. Therefore, Mr President, the Council confirms that fishing pressure would be greater and more dangerous for the fish stocks than with the solution chosen. Specifically: 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal's fishing possibilities in 2000, compared with 5 008 tonnes, or 73.9%, in 1999. These figures represent, in our view and from the Council's perspective, a real improvement in terms of conservation, when compared with the 80% quota established by Council Regulation No 685/95. Question No 6, by the Honourable Member (H-0788/99): Subject: Measures to address the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Roma in Kosovo NATO Defence Ministers have launched (2.12.1999) a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of minorities in Kosovo. The European Parliament also condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population in a resolution on the terrible acts of violence against Serbs and Roma, and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244. The EP resolution also stresses that previous persecutions against Albanians ""cannot be used as a pretext for murder, kidnapping, detention, intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property, occupation of houses, etc."""	it
Honourable Member, I take note of your statement and the existence of this joint resolution. If the Presidency services confirm that it has been tabled, it goes without saying that it will be taken into consideration. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon. (The sitting closed at 8.14 p.m.) Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting Mr President, I would just like to pass on some information. There was a terrorist attack in Madrid this morning. They put a bomb in a car. One person died. I would simply like, on behalf of my group, to condemn these terrorist acts once again. Thank you, Mrs Fraga. We have indeed heard of this deplorable event. Unfortunately, once again, murderous terrorism is affecting Spanish society and the Presidency of this sitting, being Spanish, welcomes your words, as you will understand, with particular intensity. (The Minutes were approved) Resumption of the session I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament, adjourned on Friday 21 January 2000. Madam President, allow me to point out that tomorrow marks the second anniversary of the Cermis massacre. Two years ago, in Cavalese, Italy, an American plane from the NATO base in Aviano, during a low-altitude exercise - beyond safety limits - cut the wires of a cableway, causing the death of more than 20 European citizens. Since then, the families of the victims, who have not had the comfort of justice since the pilot responsible for the act did not face criminal consequences, have been expecting at least prompt financial compensation from the United States. I therefore appeal to the President of this House and to the President of the Commission to act as guarantors to the US authorities for immediate compensation, and this in defence of the rights of the families of the victims. I thank you and take note of your speech. Madam President, I am speaking to support the decision of the Conference of Presidents and I take this opportunity to point out that, after having publicly criticised the Presidency last January, this time I consider the statements made by the Presidency on the subject in question to be appropriate - also on behalf of the Socialist Group -: we agree with them on the substance, the form and the timing. There could not be a more appropriate debate for applying Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure. This is a topical, urgent and highly relevant debate. To make room for it, we therefore believe it necessary to change the agenda. (Applause) Is there a speech against the proposal? Madam President, I intend to speak against the proposal on a question of principle which I consider fundamental and which concerns respect for the Treaties, in particular Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, until now, on the basis of the provisions of the Treaties of Rome and Paris which established the Communities, which later became the European Union, we believed that the Union was an association of free, independent and sovereign States. Although many developments have raised many doubts, we had believed, despite everything, in their appropriateness and even recently we had alluded, albeit only in passing, it must be said, to the principle of subsidiarity.	it
"You have started boldly, emphasizing, quite rightly, the need to focus on so-called ""core tasks."" As you yourself said today, this means you will also need to identify tasks, policies, and programs that are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission's primary vocation. Perhaps many of the European Union's current policies and programs have simply passed their expiration date or have proven cumbersome, difficult to manage, or ineffective when implemented at the European level. The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible to lower levels of national, regional, and local government. If we are to persuade a skeptical European society of the benefits of closer European integration, we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in devolving unjustified EU powers as we are in developing new EU powers. We must not allow those who criticize European integration to claim, as they currently do and not without some justification, as we heard from Mr. Bonde, that the increase in Community powers is a one-way street. It must be shown that it is a two-way process, in which current Community policies and programs that are not clearly justified on grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality are returned and revoked. If you are able to support these aspirations with action in the coming years, you will make an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and, as we have heard today, you can count on broad support from this European Parliament. Madam President, Mr. President of the Commission, I fully subscribe to the logic of the proposals made by my colleague Heidi Hautala regarding the Commission's strategic objectives for the next five years. For my part, I will limit myself to a topic that you have not addressed and that was planned, which is the Commission's work programme for 2000. I am aware of the limitations of the exercise, since we are working within the framework of the current Treaty and are limited by its operating rules—I am thinking in particular of an important topic such as fiscal matters. But I would precisely like not to address these. I will begin by welcoming a series of proposals you are making for this 2000 programme. I am thinking of all these proposals on food safety, which are ambitious and important, and I am also thinking of maritime safety, following the two oil spills we have experienced along the Brittany coast and in Turkey. It is good that the Commission is reacting quickly on this issue. On the other hand, on other issues, I believe it could be more ambitious, moving more quickly. And I would like to make a series of positive proposals, thinking in particular of the social sphere, the environment, and the follow-up to Seattle. A preliminary observation: you've said that it's necessary to reconcile European citizens with the institutions, that's obvious, and therefore I think it's important to ask ourselves about citizens' priority concerns. I believe, for example, that in social matters, it's not enough to announce a communication on a program of social actions."	es
"In his fourteen-page document there is not even once mention of national parliaments, which are elected by the people. However, it is true that they have no role to play in his strategy. He does not even have the courage to call things by their name and takes refuge behind a pseudo-fashionable semantics by calling ""gouvernance"" what is nothing other than a federal, autocratic and central government. After having tried for years to convince by talking about shared sovereignty, today you confess your ultimate goal: to sell off all European sovereignty, national or collective, to a world government in which you do not even hope to obtain a prominent position. Finally, you allow yourselves to condemn and sanction, or have condemned and sanctioned, the free democratic vote of millions of Austrians, for the sole reason that the result does not please you, while at the same time you support communist China and trade with countries that have been blatantly violating human rights for decades now. Today, MEPs are jointly attacking a telegram from President Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel, which is clearly not a show of sympathy, but a political maneuver. Your antics are fooling no one, because you know very well that, whether you like it or not, you will need Austria to reform the treaties and harmonize the tax treatment of savings. You will use Austria to strip the States a little more of their real powers in building the European Union, you will do it with cynicism, hypocrisy, but you will use Austria as a very convenient scarecrow. It is true that you Commissioners are not the only ones responsible: the governments that support you, out of cowardice or ideology, are equally responsible. Brussels is not all of us, as you try to make us believe, it is all of you. You don't even lie any more, you don't give a damn about the will of the European peoples, free to choose only between your best of all worlds and the pillory. More than ten years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, your plans stink of the gulag with the addition of a soothing moralism. We belong to the small group that denounced the communist dictatorship and we are and will remain among those who fight the pro-European dictatorship. We appeal to all the peoples of Europe to resist your monstrous plans. The salvation of European democracies lies in the nation state, in the nation state, that of Europe in the cooperation between its nations. (Applause from some benches) President Prodi, you have presented us today with a five-year program of the Commission with many shared objectives, a program made up of scenarios and themes and it is therefore right to remain, beyond the concrete moments, on the big themes. It seems to me that, from your words and from the document that you have sent us, a theme that is very dear to you, Mr President, as it is to me, has remained in the background: solidarity, not so much on the international level as on the internal level. The Archbishop of Milan, Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini, is calling on all politicians, and in particular those like you and me, Mr. President, who make the commitment of Catholics in politics the cultural and value-based origin of their presence, to reconsider a theme of development that, beyond economic profit, looks with great, very great attention to the least, the excluded."	it
In this context, we must monitor what happens with the port in Gaza, with the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank, with the continued release of security prisoners, and with the fulfillment of economic commitments. The second point concerns Syria. In this, the border issue is essential. We still know nothing about the outcome of the negotiations. However, the important thing is that they have begun. An important issue in this context is the distribution of water. Currently, the Golan Heights supplies between one-third and one-seventh of Israel's water. The third aspect is the peace talks in Syria, which are closely linked to Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon. According to UNIFIL data, there are concrete signs that Israel is preparing a withdrawal, which we welcome. Other contentious issues are also the water supply and the situation of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. My last point is the future Palestinian state. It is possible that it will be established this year, with or without Israeli support. The Barak government has indicated that it is prepared to sign a peace agreement with a state. Although the peace negotiations will not be concluded by September of this year, there are no treaty impediments to the creation of a Palestinian state after that date. In this context, it is important for those of us who support this idea to achieve what Commissioner Patten indicated, namely, a transparent and democratic state. We all want to contribute to this. Mr. President, I would first like to refer to the joint resolution that will be drafted at the conclusion of this debate, to which my group has contributed and which we naturally support. But, more specifically, I would like to express here our satisfaction that Israel and Syria, after so long a period of disagreement, have resumed talks to resolve their differences of opinion. The recent negotiations already constitute an important step towards permanent peace in the Middle East. It is therefore regrettable that the peace talks have currently been suspended. Both sides must truly make a tremendous effort. Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved through an agreement that guarantees the security of Israel's borders and the integrity of Syria. This requires the establishment of stable diplomatic relations and ongoing dialogue. In addition to bilateral meetings with Syria, I hope that, within the foreseeable future, Israel will also begin negotiations with Lebanon and that, within the framework of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach will be possible. However, it must continue to be regretted that the European Union, one of the most important financial donors, is not always able to play an influential political role in the peace process. This Middle East peace process is one of the priorities of the European Union's common foreign and security policy.	es
"By not introducing this environmental dimension in data management, the Commission could unilaterally and at its discretion prohibit the use of this or that fishing gear. Amendment 4 specifies the obligation on scientific experts to process and transmit all data to the competent authorities, including national and regional authorities, so that they can contribute to the decision-making process. Amendment 5 allows the Commission's proposal to be softened. In fact, the information requested from the authorities must be reasonable, so as to allow operational knowledge of fishing activity to be achieved without infringing the fundamental right to confidentiality, for example in the tax field, where there is no Community competence. Amendment 6 aims to make the Commission's participation in the control procedure more binding. It is necessary for all data to be transmitted annually and for the Commission to regularly review the overall results. Lastly, Amendment 5 7 requires the Commission to draw up a report by the end of 2001. Since the reform of the common fisheries policy is scheduled for 2002, it is necessary for all political actors to be able to see the information on which the Commission's proposal will be based. Hudghton report (A5-0036/2000) - (FR) The amendment to the directive, as presented to us by the Commission, is important because it deals with a specific disease, infectious salmon anaemia, a contagious viral disease transmitted through water via organic substances such as blood, faeces, mucus, etc. There is no scientific evidence to confirm the possibility of vertical transmission of the disease through fish eggs or milk. However, we know that other species, such as trout, eel or herring, can be carriers of the virus without being affected by it. This disease was isolated in 1984 in Norway and in 1996 in Canada. However, since the virus does not survive above 26ºC, it does not pose any danger to humans. The disease, which mainly affects the Scottish salmon sector, was identified there in May 1998. Today, ISA affects 240 salmon farms and it is therefore important to contain the disease so as to prevent it from spreading to all aquaculture farms in the various Member States of the European Union. The Council's proposal aims to establish a system of progressive elimination of fish affected by the disease and a vaccination programme. As regards the progressive elimination system, we can only support the proposal. It is essential to help the affected farms to ""clean up"" the infection source, thus preventing the spread of the disease and facilitating the commercial movement of live fish. As regards vaccination, it should be remembered that the Directive initially prohibited the use of vaccines against ISA. With the new proposal, the Commission would be in favor of authorizing its use, but no such vaccines have yet been discovered. The utility of the proposal is therefore limited at best, at least in the short term. Canada has a vaccine that has proven effective in 76 percent of cases, but since the Canadian strain is different from the European one, the vaccine in question cannot be used as it is in Europe."	it
The forced convergence of different systems, in addition to clashing with the principle of subsidiarity, Mr President, I do not believe will lead to the desired result, because ultimately there will always be a way to circumvent the system, with disastrous results for the environment. Mr President, every day five million pieces of solid waste are thrown overboard from ships. This waste floats in the seas and ends up on beaches, causing serious damage to the environment and to marine flora and fauna. The consequence is that millions of birds and one hundred thousand marine mammals and sea turtles die every year. The MARPOL Convention aims to prevent pollution caused by ships but it is clear that legislation is also needed to ensure its application. Hence the importance of the directive in question and this is why I am pleased this evening with the progress made in the Council with a view to reaching a common position that obliges ships to deliver the waste they produce to waste collection facilities in ports. I too congratulate the rapporteur, whose commitment reflects the strength and passion with which our committee addresses this particular issue and the strong desire across the political spectrum of MEPs to put an end to these environmentally disastrous practices. I particularly welcome his strong support for the proposal that environmental requirements should apply to all ships regardless of their flag and that adequate waste reception facilities should be made available in all Community ports, all with a view to improving pollution prevention and avoiding distortions of competition. One area where British Labour MEPs disagree with the rapporteur is how to apply the polluter pays principle. We strongly support this principle, but believe that its application can be made more efficient if Member States retain the freedom to decide which charging system is best suited to their particular circumstances. For example, in the UK we have a system that works well, whereby the ship pays the waste collection operator every time it uses its reception facilities, without any involvement of the port. This system is based on a consensus reached by all the stakeholders, with the participation of the ports and environmental organisations such as the RSPB and the WWF. However, like the rapporteur, we absolutely do not want different charging systems to increase the risk of marine pollution. That is why we support the Council in its proposal to strengthen the review clause, to ensure regular monitoring of the impact of the directive. Mr President, those who have witnessed the disastrous environmental effects of the Erika disaster will certainly not be able to vote against a report on the disposal of ship fuel waste. This is an exceptionally important report. In this respect, it should be stressed that what is most lacking is not legislation. All EU countries have signed the so-called MARPOL Convention, while the Baltic countries have also signed the Helsinki Convention. Both respond to the purpose of avoiding discharges into the sea. However, it is necessary to improve access to reception facilities and create incentives to use them.	it
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new EU-ACP Convention is an important step towards greater coherence. It is positive that this new agreement establishes criteria such as human rights, democracy, the rule of law, and good governance more than ever before. It is positive that past colonial relations no longer permeate most of our relations, but that these political criteria have gained greater weight here. This is the prerequisite for any development. If these criteria are not respected, development will have no chance. This, Mr. Modrow, also applies to Cuba. I welcome Cuba's involvement in this process, but some changes still need to take place in that country. We are all familiar with the Amnesty International reports. It may be that you, as one of the last holders of communist power, possibly view it differently than most of this House and that you see problems with good governance. However, this is an important criterion for the European Union. I would like to address a second issue. We are talking here about coherence. Many colleagues have given examples of the extent to which the various policies are inconsistent. But, from my point of view, development policy itself needs more consistency. It is inconsistent that coordination with the Member States continues to fail, that in developing countries, Member States of the European Union are partly implementing very opposing projects. Nor is it consistent with the European taxpayer that we pursue a development policy that is regulated in the Union budget, but that the EDF continues to be excluded. Mr. President of the Council, if you can ensure that these €13.5 billion are in the future subject to the control of Parliament, of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and are subject to mechanisms such as OLAF, then I believe that the level of acceptance will increase. I believe that this should also be a demand of the Intergovernmental Conference: the establishment of the EDF within the European Union budget. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, overall, we believe this text is indeed well-intentioned, and yet we did not vote on it in committee, nor will we vote on it in plenary, for two reasons which, moreover, gave rise, on our part, to amendments that I would like to briefly elaborate on here. First and foremost, the Committee on Development and Cooperation seeks the communitarization of the European Development Fund, and it is clearly mistaken in this regard. Cooperation is, and, in our view, must remain, an intergovernmental exercise. At a time when Europe is preparing for enlargement, communitarization of the European Development Fund would allow some to very easily disguise their lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget, without taking into account, moreover, that it would eliminate a fruitful and promising way of associating our partners in the South with our cooperation policy. Finally, as Mrs. Maes has just rightly pointed out, the Commission has recently demonstrated the difficulties it experiences in transparently managing the funds it allocates to its development and humanitarian aid programs.	es
Just as we thought the debate was over, dazzling amendments reached the House, which I request that you reject outright. They suggest, for example, that we should use the meager fishing budget to finance artistic treasures or promote maritime tourism. Other amendments, such as amendment number 4, which calls for the funding of biological recovery periods, demonstrate a profound ignorance of fisheries regulations by calling for measures that are already in force, even though everything could still be improved. I therefore ask that the four amendments tabled be rejected and that the chapter on fisheries and the environment be closed with the idea put forward in the committee debate, namely that both are closely linked and suffer the effects of the same attacks on the environment. As I have said so many times, fishing is more the victim than the cause of the destruction of the marine ecosystem, and tomorrow, in the debate on the Erika, we will have the opportunity to demonstrate this. Mr President, Mr. Katiforis's report had the merit of injecting vitality, polemics, and a combative spirit into a communication in which the Commission merely lists a series of good wishes while admitting its inability to put them into practice. What Mr. Katiforis certainly did not lack was the courage to set out the measures that, in his view, could contribute to the recovery and conservation of the sea's natural resources. I say this because I disagree with many of his proposals, as I am among those who believe that in fishing, it is not only the resources that are important—they are—but also the people who have practiced this activity for centuries. I agree with the rapporteur that greater coordination of European fisheries and environmental policy is needed. What we fundamentally lack, however, is the courage and political determination on the part of the Commission and the Member States to make decisions and apply the existing rules. Not only fisheries and the environment should be integrated, but also maritime transport, employment, and energy. With regard to the Structural Funds, I could cite a whole series of examples here, but I will save that for another occasion. The European Parliament is aware of the limited nature of resources and the need to conduct responsible fishing. It demands rigor from the Commission and the Member States regarding compliance with TACs and quotas established according to objective scientific criteria, and demands that everyone be judged by the same yardstick. Discards, as Mr Katiforis says, represent a waste of resources that we cannot accept. Twenty million tonnes of unusable catch are thrown back. The fleet must be equipped with fishing gear for increasingly selective fishing. This Parliament has already opposed driftnets, and yet we see certain Member States not only disregarding their obligation to eliminate them but increasing the number of vessels using this gear or simply failing to provide data, given the passivity of the national and Community authorities. We Socialists believe that defending the Common Fisheries Policy means advocating for regulated and controlled fishing activities. It is essential that the Commission launch an information campaign on the CFP with this message in mind.	de
The next point concerns the actions we have undertaken. As you know, the Portuguese Presidency has already established a high-level group, which will present its first report in June at the Summit. The Portuguese Presidency is focusing on two themes: sustainable pension systems and social inclusion. I believe the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and could contribute to taking us a step further following the approval of this high-level group. Regarding certain comments on the role of social protection systems and their cost, and on the role these systems play in the competitiveness of Member States, I would like to point out that what policies in the European Union are trying to combine is competitiveness and social cohesion. Naturally, we must take into account the issue of competitiveness, and social protection planning must be done in such a way that social protection is a factor in economic growth and employment. And I believe this is evident in the text of the communication. Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, the objective is that next year, following the unanimous decision of the Council, we will move forward with the initial level of coordination, the exchange of opinions, the recording of social problems, and the creation of a database for better policy coordination. As many of you have expressed, I believe we have taken an important first step. Social policy issues are now being addressed more broadly at the Intergovernmental Conference, and I believe we are in a new phase, where social policy will largely constitute a European policy. Thank you very much, Ms. Diamantopoulou. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11:30. WIPO Treaty The next item is recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs. Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council decision (COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)) on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. (SV) Mr. President, we are about to take a decision on an important matter, an international agreement, a matter that could influence the development of well-being in many countries. In my country, Sweden, it concerns one of the largest export sectors. The branches affected are music and phonograms. It concerns the copyright of artists, for the protection of their artistic creations. These are the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty). Without copyright protection, economic incentives and creativity are stifled. Counterfeiting is big business. It is estimated that €4.5 billion in revenue is lost in Europe alone due to pirated copies. The problem affects many jobs in the entertainment industry. This treaty is historic, as the EU is one of its signatories. This is true, even though the members of the organization are the member states of the Union, not the EU.	es
And here we come to the heart of the matter: This project on social harmonization not only touches on social policy; it is a follow-up to the Community EMU project, which has a very specific interest in the three countries that remain outside and can be saved from this Titanic, namely, Great Britain, Sweden, and Denmark. Hence, it is important for us to emphasize that we cannot support a proposal whose logical basis is to consolidate the EMU project. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the Commission's communication on the modernization of social protection because, in my opinion, it moves in the direction—although it does not entirely succeed—of finally providing European legislation in the social and pensions fields. I listened with regret to the previous explanation of vote, as I believe that the spirit of this report is oriented toward the possibility of protecting the elderly even more, if possible. And this, despite the fact that we know that the governments of the fifteen Member States would like to reduce the amount of pensions as much as possible. I hope that Parliament will have the power to legislate on pensions as soon as possible. Older people rely on the European Parliament to enable them to live well and with dignity, and better than they do now. Less developed nations must reach the same level as the states that, within the European Union, guarantee greater social protection. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament today voted in favor of the report by our Swedish colleague, Social Democrat Jan Andersson, on the Commission Communication: A Concerted Strategy to Modernize Social Protection. The Commission Communication takes as its starting point the launch of EMU, which, with its ambition for stability and growth, creates the basis for Member States to strengthen their social security systems. The report makes it clear that modernization does not mean reducing the level of social protection, but rather making better use of existing resources. Furthermore, we have also noted that the explanatory memorandum establishes that modernization does not mean harmonization of social security systems and that harmonization would be detrimental, as it could require higher standards in weaker Member States and, at the same time, for reasons of competition, could pressure the more socially developed states to make cuts to the social security system. A situation from which no one would benefit. Both the Commission Communication and Mr. Andersson's report emphasize that it is the Member States who are responsible and thus who decide the content of social security systems. Collaboration on these issues under the auspices of the EU must provide added value, based on the exchange of experiences and the mutual evaluation of policy developments with a view to establishing best practice. (SV) We believe that the report contains many good practical proposals, which we support, but we are very critical of the convergence perspective that characterizes the report.	es
"Even today there are no certain answers on the control of nuclear power plants in the Eastern Republics. We therefore need to have resources to spend before proceeding with an enlargement, to finally give life to a European control force, charged with verifying the quality and conditions of life, in order to create a new world in which certain tragedies no longer occur. I would also like to say a word about Africa, Madam President. The Third and Fourth Worlds are abandoned: one dollar, one euro and a half would be enough to save many children. Europe, so democratic, so progressive, is silent and does not take charge of these tragic problems, while half of Africa dies of AIDS and other diseases. One last consideration regarding the Internet and globalization. The globalization of the economy cannot become the standardization of products and qualities, just as the globalization of politics cannot become the flattening of values, hopes, and enthusiasms. The people who do not participate, and slowly move away, leave room for an oligarchy that takes power and leaves control to a few. As for the Internet: Europe must finally have the courage to say that rules are needed. At this time, allow me, in a personal capacity, to address my applause to those pirates who, by acting as they are acting, are forcing the world to reflect on the only system that today has no rules. We are the world of rules: let us also give rules to the Internet, thus giving rules and hope to the future of our fellow citizens. Madam President, as a taxpayer from the Po Valley, I have already experienced the grip of the tax collector Prodi, then Head of Government in Italy, to whom Padania is also fiscally subject. I listened to him now with concern, when he mentioned new resources, a concept that can easily be translated into the imposition of new taxes and new duties, in view, among other things, of enlargement, that is, the entry of new States into the Union. But why don't they pay their own entrance fee? My Padanian voters who, thanks to Prodi, have already paid what in Italy is known as the tax on Europe - only partly repaid - have absolutely no intention, again thanks to Prodi, of paying another one for someone else. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, five months after taking office, the Commission has put in black and white the direction in which it intends to push the European Union. The result is an ambitious document, certainly, but also pompous. Isn't it pathetic to say that ""the world is looking to Europe""? Furthermore, the European continent is not only made up of the fifteen Member States of the European Union. Claiming to want to guarantee peace, democracy and respect for human rights in, note well, the whole of Europe seems rather ambitious to me and I am especially fascinated to know how the Commission intends to achieve this objective. The model of European integration as a form of global government, I wonder whether this perhaps means exporting a model based on the concentration of power on a large scale. The Commission believes that foreign policy can only be successful if everyone knows exactly who is in charge! But who is in charge?"	it
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Middle East peace process is an extremely delicate issue. The exact borders of the State of Israel, the only democracy in this region, can only be recognized by all if these negotiations are successful. The implementation of the trade agreement between the European Union and Israel, which does not further define the territory of the State of Israel, must take place in this context. Add to this the existence of a close link between economic activities on the Israeli side and those on Palestinian territory. To this end, the Paris Protocol annexed to the Oslo Accords also provides for a customs ""envelope"" that encompasses the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Furthermore, the Commission and the aforementioned parties have agreed to the establishment of a joint working group to address underlying issues, including the fact that the Palestinian economy would be affected by unilateral actions by the European Union. Potential investors in this region have already indicated that they will withdraw if joint ventures are no longer preferred. Mr President, this House broadly shares the concern raised in Mrs Morgantini's question. I believe that Commissioner Vitorino has made the Commission's position clear and, in my view, adequately addressed the concerns raised here, but it seems to me that we should not stop there. Therefore, it seems to me that we could, based on this statement, broaden the points of convergence, drawing on the valuable information that Mrs Morgantini and I were able to deduce during a visit to the region with the President of Parliament. I believe, firstly, that despite the existing difficulties that we were able to observe in situ, we must reiterate our support for direct dialogue between the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, with a view to a just, stable and definitive peace agreement. Secondly, I believe that both parties have an interest in ensuring the economic development of the region and in firmly addressing the reduction of the significant imbalances of wealth observed in the region. Thirdly, finally, the Commission could perhaps consider the usefulness of deepening the task of a trilateral working group, obviously with the participation of the European Union, ensuring compliance with trade agreements and helping us to advance the cooperation offered by the European Union for the benefit of all parties concerned. I listened to Commissioner Vitorino's response and I must say that I am satisfied. I believe that his intervention addresses the concerns raised in the question. I also believe that we must stress the importance, for the European Union and therefore, from an executive point of view, for the Commission, of promoting tripartite activities, particularly with regard to the levels of economic, financial and scientific cooperation, so that our quantitative presence in financial terms can more often be transformed into a more significant presence in the Middle East. This, I believe, is the lesson to be learned from this already long-standing story. As for the specific subject, I heard that Mr. Galeote was referring to the visit of our President and Mr. Menéndez del Valle to that of President Prodi to Israel and other countries in the Middle East."	fr
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Guterres for his remarks this evening and for his initiative regarding the Lisbon Summit, which is very important for us. If we are honest, we must admit that it has been a long road from the Luxembourg Employment Summit to the Lisbon Summit, and that we now expect concrete results from this Lisbon Summit; something tangible must come out of it. There are many European citizens in the public gallery this evening, and I wonder what they think of our discussion today. I hope that these citizens will leave this evening's plenary session certain that the European Union institutions have now embarked on a process that will truly lead to the restoration of full employment in the European Union. Many challenges lie ahead on the road to full employment. Some of these challenges will be difficult to overcome, but what is important is that we put into practice what we have been talking about for many, many years: full employment, a society without social exclusion, a society of innovation and knowledge. This is the great challenge and the great importance of the Lisbon Summit. I would like to briefly highlight some key aspects that will enable us to put our words into action. First, we need to establish benchmarks and initiate a mutual evaluation process; we need to set objectives, real objectives that we can achieve; and we need to encourage governments to undertake the courageous process of saying, ""Yes, we are not afraid of comparison with each other; we will measure ourselves against the rest of the world."" This requires courage, because some Member States will find themselves at the bottom of the table, and that is not pleasant for anyone. It is nevertheless important that the Lisbon Summit leads to concrete results and not to a different direction—a direction Prime Minister Guterres certainly does not want to take because he is genuinely interested in achieving something at the Lisbon Summit. Other areas must not be neglected either. This includes the challenge of creating an ""e-Europe"" that includes all citizens and leaves no one behind. Another area is the creation of a genuine internal market, which we still do not have, and this includes skills development, which is central to creating an innovative knowledge-based society. This requires difficult choices, but I would like to address the citizens in the gallery following this debate and reassure them that we will achieve a society based on full employment, that the Lisbon Summit will mark the end of a long journey and will deliver concrete results. I welcome the new strategic objective of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive area. Who could question such an ambitious goal? I would point out, however, that dynamism and entrepreneurship, as well as social cohesion, are ambitious goals, not to mention the creative tension between these two."	de
"I do not believe that there is a broad consensus in Europe in favour of introducing qualified majority voting on taxation, justice and internal and foreign affairs at Union level. According to Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome, tax decisions adopted at European level must be voted unanimously. I believe that this provision should remain in force, as a common tax code would reduce rather than increase the functioning of the European Union. I am in favour of enlargement of the European Union. I am in favour of institutional changes that will allow enlargement to be implemented in a structured and simplified way. However, we must not forget that the public opinion of 370 million citizens of the European Union is a fundamental factor to be taken into account if we want to change the Treaties. Changes must not be introduced too quickly and must not be too radical, otherwise public opinion will oppose the ratification of any future Union Treaty. Madam President, I will speak on behalf of the Italian Radical MEPs. Mr President of the Commission, you said earlier that no political structure produces five-year plans. That is true, if we think of Russia's plans in the 1930s, but you yourself announced a few months ago, at the beginning of your mandate, to the Conference of Presidents that you would instead present a legislative programme, that is, the broad lines of the European government over which you preside, and in whose exercise we are today engaged. So, if it must be a government programme or a programme of tendencies, the analysis of the document that you have distributed to us and of the speech that accompanied it reveals itself more as a catalogue of good intentions or, better said, of problems on the table, without however giving the impression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these points, that is, is carrying out the task that is proper to the European Commission. In the Chamber of this Parliament we have had, in the past, major debates on major strategic options that the Commission, by virtue of its power of initiative, launched, rather than as trial balloons, as proposals that then went more or less far, but which nevertheless contributed to the integration and development of the European Union. In this case, Mr President, we certainly have a decalogue: a whole series of problems have been listed but, if I may, with the impression that on none of these has the Commission in any way dared to say ""this is what should be done"". Only on one point do you seem to have insisted a lot - I think too much - and that is on the fact that the task that you are almost setting as a priority is that of dismantling ""unnecessary"" activities. But let us be careful, Mr President, because we have had a crisis of confidence in the Commission and we have placed our trust in this Commission - the majority, at least, of this Parliament has placed its trust in this Commission - precisely because, first and foremost, the reform of the Commission was linked to a strengthening, to a new identity, to a new awareness of being guided once again by a sure hand."	it
"(SV) Mr. President, Madam Minister, Commissioner, ""women hold up half the sky,"" a successful man once said. But when it comes to political decisions and priorities, women's voices are absent. Women, who make up more than half of the population, are insufficiently represented in the political, social, and economic spheres. This is unacceptable in a democracy! The greatest gap in equal opportunities, de jure and de facto, lies in the decision-making process. Achieving balance requires a concrete action plan with a fixed timetable. A benchmarking system would be an important part of this action plan to ensure full female participation in power and decision-making structures. I am therefore pleased that the Commissioner agrees to a system of this nature. I propose that the targets for women in the decision-making process be based on the average of the three most successful Member States in each sector, with each Member State required to report annually. These reports will then need to be evaluated. Women are the primary victims of human rights violations such as rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence, and human trafficking, yet they are underrepresented in the judicial and legislative bodies that prosecute these crimes. This means that these crimes are not given priority and that the perpetrators often go unpunished. Women are the primary victims of armed conflict, yet they are absent from peacekeeping, conflict resolution, and reconstruction efforts. Therefore, in the resolution, we urge Member States to increase the proportion of women in conflict resolution and peacekeeping activities. Equal female participation is not only a demand for social justice and democracy, but is also a duty to ensure that women's experiences and knowledge are fully taken into account. Failure to include women's capacity in the decision-making process is an unacceptable waste. Women must not only ""bear half the sky"" but must also have the right to assume responsibilities on Earth. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the Presidency of the Council and the Commissioner for the excellent speeches they have made today. We have high expectations of their actions. We are beginning a millennium and a century that will be—we hope—decisive for women and for their ability to occupy decision-making positions. We want this opportunity to bring about important changes to our life in society, for democracy to also be synonymous with equality between men and women, and for women not to be excluded either economically or socially, as is still the case today. And thus, for values dear to women—such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security, and environmental protection—to predominantly guide life in the European Union and, if possible, in the world. To achieve this, it is necessary to give women the opportunity to counter the inertia of a society that has so far been essentially imbued with masculine values."	es
"This is a problem of compatibility between our VFU directives and the old directives, including AUTO-OIL, which we voted on a few years ago. We can therefore be satisfied with the common sense shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which reintroduced, to dispel any doubt, the exception relating to vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage. In conclusion, I will say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems linked to the current car fleet but is rather hypocritical in terms of the fate it reserves for abandoned cars which still clutter up our forests, our lakes and our gardens. Once again, the ""polluter pays"" principle is not applied and it is always the taxpayer who pays. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reading the leaflets distributed in recent weeks, one might think that we are discussing the maximum acceptable ecological risk or the death of the car industry in Europe. Neither hypothesis is correct. We must be objective: this directive is good; it represents ecological progress in Europe and we can be proud to translate this directive into law and pass it. However, there is one point on which we disagree. Perhaps, given the size of the directive, it is a small point, but that is where the controversy lies. It is the costs of recycling. In this respect, we are clearly distant from the debate in the Council last year, in which free last-holder tax and the problem of financing were mixed up in the same pot, and free last-holder tax was called into question. In February last year, Parliament decided - and we in the PSE Group are sticking to that decision - that free last-holder tax is out of the question! But who should pay for the vehicles to be disposed of? It is clear to us that for new vehicles these costs should be borne by the manufacturer, because then they too will be encouraged to design and build vehicles that are easily recyclable. But what about vehicles that are already on the road? For example, if it were to be responsible for all its end-of-life vehicles, the UK-based Rover would be responsible for 5.8 million vehicles in the European Union and would have to immediately set aside €250 million to cover the costs of recycling, while a Korean manufacturer building similar vehicles would only have to set aside ""peanuts"", as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it. These are distortions of competition that have nothing to do with environmental protection, but only affect the investment capacity and jobs of the European car industry. We therefore propose creating a fund for end-of-life vehicles from which the costs of recycling these vehicles would be paid, in order to respect the principle of free of charge. I understand colleagues from countries without an automotive industry who argue that the entire burden should fall on the manufacturers and that the problem of distortions of competition and the associated provisions does not concern them."	it
For two years, these fears have materialised. The banana dispute is the most striking proof of this. Developing countries are being asked to align themselves with the liberalisation of trade, despite the fragility of their economies. Although Mr Corrie's report denounces this situation well and reaffirms the Joint Assembly's fidelity to the Lomé model, it does not sufficiently highlight a second problem which, in all fairness, also stems from the free-trade error: the inconsistency of regional trade agreements concluded by the European Union. The cooperation agreement with South Africa is the best example of this. The Council approved this agreement, negotiated by the Commission, at the same time as the agricultural chapter, although essential, had not yet been finalised. As Mr Paul-Marie Coûteaux very correctly observed in his speech yesterday and in his proposed amendments, one wonders what political coherence such a blank cheque can have. All this is very worrying, especially as a similar agreement seems to be on the cards with Mexico. Likewise, we cannot support the rapporteur when he calls for the European Development Fund to be merged into the Community budget. We do indeed want to maintain the clear commitment and responsibility of each Member State that only the intergovernmental nature can guarantee. We have unfortunately seen too many examples of collective aid being diverted for which no one feels responsible, and we do not intend to extend this disastrous practice to the European Development Fund. Madam President, I welcome the Corrie report, which is a balanced assessment of the work done by this House over the past year. The report comes hot on the heels of the agreement to renew the current Lomé Convention, which expires at the end of the month. The new agreement provides for EUR 13.5 billion in development funding over the next seven years; it is essential that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals in the ACP countries. We must also work tirelessly to eradicate corruption and waste, and we must involve civil society in the planning and implementation of these projects. The decision to include a clause requiring ACP countries to take back people who have illegally emigrated to Europe is worrying; this clause must be applied with extreme caution. I hope that before this new Lomé Convention expires we can welcome Cuba as a full member. According to estimates by the Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS, at the end of 1998 there were a total of 33.4 million people in the world living with HIV. More than 95 percent of all infected people live in developing countries, with sub-Saharan Africa being the most affected region in the world. Only 10 percent of the world's population lives in sub-Saharan Africa, but it is home to 70 percent of all people diagnosed with AIDS in 1998. Eighty percent of the 13.9 million AIDS-related deaths worldwide occurred in this region. In Africa, AIDS is not just a public or private health problem; it is a development issue.	it
"The under-representation of women in politics, for example, continues to be a reality. And yet, we all recognise the importance of women's ever greater involvement in politics. Only women are capable of inventing policies that can change structures designed by men for other men, because it is precisely structural discrimination that women have to contend with most, whether in politics or on the labour market. It is therefore up to European political parties to open up to women. Article 191 of the Treaty itself (ex 138 A) highlights their role as, and I quote, ""an important factor for integration within the Union"". And the article goes on to state that ""they [political parties] contribute to forming a European awareness [as well as a European identity] and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union"". Such a provision, although not having legal force, is nevertheless extremely symbolic, as it gives political parties an important role in building a democratic Europe which could be expressed, for example, in the implementation of positive actions and the promotion of equality within our political parties. During the 1999 European elections, some parties presented equal lists. Well, this is good practice which needs to be generalised. I do not know whether there is a causal link, but it is true that the proportion of women MEPs rose from 25.7% in 1994 to 29.9% in 1999, not to mention that, since the 1999 elections, the Parliament has been presided over by a woman. I will end by reiterating the conclusions drawn from the April 1999 Conference organised by the Commission, entitled ""Women and men in power"". Equality between men and women is not an issue which concerns women alone, it is a challenge which concerns our whole society! Progress has been made recently in increasing the participation of women in decision-making bodies in the Union. Today, 30 percent of elected representatives in our institution are women, including the President of the European Parliament, while Finland has just elected a female President. On average, a quarter of the governments of the Member States are women and more than a fifth of the national parliaments. This is far from satisfactory, given that the figures vary greatly from country to country and that the Nordic countries have significantly higher representation of women in key positions in terms of responsibility and decision-making power. This is above all a question of approach and respect for the quality and skills that women can bring to society, and not a system of fixed quotas. In general, my group is not in favour of quotas, as they could be counterproductive in the long run and even undermine the cause they are intended to promote. We nevertheless recognise that experience varies from country to country and that the use of such a system could be justified as a temporary measure to rebalance the presence of women where women are poorly represented. We decided to vote for the resolution on women in decision-making which was adopted in commemoration of International Women's Day on 8 March and which incorporated ten amendments tabled by the Liberal Group and toned down the references to quotas, in line with the approach described above."	it
The measures are not limited to legislation. To promote and support dialogue as a cornerstone of successful adaptation to change, the Commission is also currently addressing the recommendations of the Lillehammer Report by working on the establishment of a European Observatory on Industrial Change. We are also considering another proposal from this group of experts, the report on managing change. Finally, let me turn to some of the other issues raised in the draft resolution presented to this House. Regarding the link between competition and social policy, I would like to remind you that the Merger Regulation contains a provision giving workers' representatives the opportunity to be heard by the Commission in the context of the relevant procedure. We broadly recognize the need for due attention, in the various bodies, to all aspects of such measures, including their impact on employment. As an example, I would mention that the public authorities, namely the Commission, have already taken measures, through guidelines on national regional aid that entered into force on 1 January this year, to ensure that the provision of public funds remains linked to the recipients of regional aid and, consequently, to the jobs associated with the investment. To this end, any regional aid is made conditional on the continued existence of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years. The same provision has been incorporated into the Structural Funds Regulation, so that it applies to all investments co-financed by the Structural Funds. Social cohesion and the interaction of policies at EU level are the focus of the upcoming Lisbon Summit. I know we will return to these issues in the future to see how best to ensure that our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe. Thank you, Commissioner. Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I see you have raised a point of order. If it is a personal statement, would you please wait until the end of this debate? I will then give you the floor. Mr President, this is a matter of public honour in this Parliament; it is not a personal statement. This morning, the President of Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to allow me to raise a point of order. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that the President has behaved in this unacceptable manner towards me. In doing so, the President infringed Rule 142, which gives priority to a point of order over all other points of order. She also infringed Rule 122, which gives all Members of this House the right to make personal remarks, remarks which, in this case, reject the comments of another Member, those of Mrs Vidal-Quadras. This partisan conduct by our President should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. I am ready to accept the President's apology at any time. Thank you for your explanation. We will, of course, ensure that the President is informed of your statement. I can assure you that, to my knowledge, the President is always reluctant to allow a debate on the matter in the middle of a vote.	de
(SV) Mr. President, I think it is very important to show the guidelines for the use of the precautionary principle in this communication, as a way of refuting claims that we always apply it for protectionist purposes. I am sure there will be more conflicts, for example, with the United States. We cannot be naive and believe otherwise. However, since we signed the Montreal Protocol, we have had international recognition and a common definition established in a protocol on the environment, health, and trade. That is why it sets a good example. Let us not think that there will be no conflicts in the future, but then we will be able to demonstrate that we do not arbitrarily apply the precautionary principle. There are now a series of guidelines for its application, and we have the strong support of our people for doing so, which is very clearly corroborated in this communication. Thank you very much, Commissioner. The attention paid to the principle of political precaution meant that we debated it for almost two hours, and this topic is now considered, so to speak, more of a matter of routine administration, although, as we have seen from the interventions, questions and answers, it is a topic to which great importance is attached. The debate is now closed. Intergovernmental Conference The next item is the report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference (14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)). (EL) Mr President, first of all, my thanks to the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for the extremely useful contacts we have maintained throughout this period. Let me also thank once again my fellow speaker, Mr. Leinen, for our extraordinary collaboration. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the Intergovernmental Conference about to begin is important in general terms, and especially in the perspective of enlargement. Its work will shape the structure and mechanisms that will underpin the functioning of 21st-century Europe. And there is no doubt that a more effective, more democratic, and fully transparent functioning of the European Union of the future requires a broad and profound reform of both its institutions and its working methods. The main prerequisite and condition for the success of this reform is the agenda that will guide the work of the Intergovernmental Conference. It is clear from the decisions taken at the Helsinki European Council that the agenda agreed upon there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the substantial changes necessary for the creation of a more functional, more effective, more democratic, and more transparent Europe. This is because it is limited to examining only three issues that only fragmentarily concern the structure and functioning of only two institutional bodies of the European Union. I won't repeat this, as it is well known to all. This observation of mine is justified, on the one hand, by the constant, sometimes particularly intense, demands of European citizens; and, on the other, by the enormous challenges posed by the great undertaking undertaken by the European Union, the undertaking of enlargement.	es
"I consider this a report in which the cooperation between the committees worked very well, and the result before us today is a sober, objective report on a particularly delicate area. Sobriety and objectiveness are therefore particularly necessary in the development of Article 280.4. If we had to award a prize to the article that is the most difficult to understand, the least clear, the most unclear – however you want to call it – then there would certainly be fierce competition, because the Treaty is a sample collection of complicated articles, but this is without doubt one of the most promising candidates for the prize. At the same time, it is a particularly delicate issue because it concerns the protection of the Community's financial interests, as Mrs Theato very rightly said. We are all aware of the need – and this Parliament has raised this concern and has been a great champion in this matter – to protect the Community's financial interests. But be careful, as the French say, ""ne jettons pas le bébé avec l'eau du bain"" (don't throw the baby out with the bathwater). In other words, when protecting the Community's financial interests, one must respect, on the one hand – and Mrs. Theato said it – the powers of the nation states, but also other matters that concern citizens, those that concern essential guarantees. The conclusions of the Theato report fully preserve these. Therefore, in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and of course also in my capacity as a Member of this House, I hope that this Parliament will support the report tomorrow with a broad majority and that it will be well implemented by the Commission. Mr. President, as Mrs. Theato pointed out, this report touches on a critical issue. This report was proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and prepared as an own-initiative report. One of the reasons we were so keen to take action is that, whether we like it or not, the European Union continues to be accused of fraud and mismanagement. Of course, exaggerations are sometimes made, but there is some truth to the accusations, and we must do something about them. Some of the measures we adopted in the past are being ignored by some Member States. We must not forget that Member States are responsible for around 80% of the implementation of the EU budget. Many of them have neither signed nor ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, so it was clear that more radical action was needed. We must take this responsibility seriously. We must be able to take action against those who commit fraud against the European Union. The question arises as to who should do this. This is where it becomes truly difficult. Who is responsible in a body that encompasses numerous countries? We must also take the interests of the Member States into account. The proposal to establish a European Public Prosecutor's Office is extremely sensible. We are all aware that a clearly federalist approach and conditions under which a European judicial body takes precedence over the respective national judicial bodies would be a bit too far for some. But the discussion on this must begin, and we therefore call on the Intergovernmental Conference to initiate it."	de
On China, we should not be deterred from raising the issue simply because discussions on the matter may be blocked. In any case, it is imperative that the Union speaks and acts as one, and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve. However, if the decisions that may ultimately be taken in Geneva are to be fully reflected, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights will need to be provided with the resources it needs. The United Nations' financial resources are under-distributed, and as a result many crucial programmes depend on voluntary contributions to remain operational. Resources are also needed to promote practical cooperation and human rights, strategic planning, priority setting and strengthening communications between the donor community and United Nations Member States. To this end, the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her Office to carry out these tasks. The European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant share of these funds. In this way, we would not only embarrass the United States by forcing it to shoulder its responsibilities for funding the United Nations, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to the protection of human rights goes beyond mere and sterile rhetoric. Mr President, this debate focuses on the preparation of the upcoming annual session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and on the role of the Commission and the Council in that context. Let me begin by expressing my great satisfaction with the statements made so far by Commissioner Patten and the Minister. I am also pleased that today we are also discussing both China and Cuba. Cuba remains the last example of a dictatorship in Latin America, and that is something we must not forget, despite all the sympathy that that country enjoys here and there. Cuba is a dictatorship, it is therefore not a democracy. In the two minutes I have available to me, I would like to focus on two countries with which I have a special connection. The first is Indonesia. We are of course very pleased that Indonesia now has a new government and that the offices of President and Vice-President are held by Mr Wahid and Mrs Soekarnopoetri. We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly developing in the right direction. However, I must tell you that in the Moluccas, which are just north of Timor, violence is still rife, after thousands of deaths in the last two years. Tens of thousands of people are now fleeing. The situation is out of control. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, Dutch television will broadcast a long programme in which observers have been asked to participate, purely and simply to observe what is happening in the Moluccas, so that everything that has really happened can be recorded, also for the benefit of posterity or human rights commissions. The urgent appeal that I now want to make concerns a point that has been included many times in our resolutions, namely the possibility of sending observers to the Moluccas.	it
"In a sparsely populated country like mine, Finland, going to the post office is a social event. In a networked world, the post office is the most democratic network, as it creates and maintains human relationships. The common market in the postal sector will be carried out according to the conditions of market forces. For us in the north, this means that the EU is going to destroy the social infrastructure. Mr. Monti, the principle of competition does not fit into the area of human relationships, and therefore, postal services must be developed, not abolished. If we want everyone to have access to and use information technology, the only way to guarantee this aspiration in society is through a public postal service. The post office is a democracy and can perform these functions better than telecommunications companies. In the telecommunications sector, prices have risen due to the continuous buying and selling of companies, since more than 50% of these companies' turnover is spent on advertising. We must make democratic investments to preserve democratic postal services. It is particularly fitting that Mr. Monti is responding to this debate, since the great dilemma facing postal services is how to balance an open market and free and fair competition, on the one hand, with the provision of a service that is universally available, even in the most remote and uninhabited region of the European Union. In the hills and valleys of Scotland, in the rural border area with England and the Midlands, in the beautiful but fragile Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland islands, there is real concern about the possible loss of this essential service. However, we all know that the quality of service can only improve if postal services, like all service activities, are given the financial and managerial freedom of the private sector and the incentive of open, even international, competition. I will suggest one possible solution, which is already widely used in the transport sector. Air, ferry, train, or bus routes operating within and to the most remote areas are put to tender. The bidder offering to provide the specific service at a set level of quality and with the lowest degree of subsidy wins the contract. Let's call it a ""negative bidding franchise."" This allows for desirable competition in the provision of these services under a publicly supported but fully transparent franchise system. Why couldn't postal collection and delivery in a particular region be subject to such negative bidding? The lowest subsidy would get the franchise for a set period. Why couldn't a sub-post office in a remote village also be subject to this kind of negative bidding? It would then be up to the democratically responsible local, regional, or national governing body—probably under overall EU supervision—to set the service criteria and the financial resources to serve this specific social objective. Otherwise, postal services could become subject to all the demands and requirements of the market. Mr. President, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Scottish Member of this House to speak in this debate. This reflects the importance of our postal services to us."	es
"So, when we come to the problems of the new knowledge-based economy, the new digital economy—which, as far as I know, has only created unemployment in Europe instead of employment—it is certainly legitimate to ask whether the inability to address the current problems of unemployment is now being replaced by a largely phrase-filled explanation of the employment problems of the future. No one understands better than all of us the crucial role played by the internet, the digital economy, and the knowledge-based economy, but these were not the original objectives of the Employment Summit. Mr. President-in-Office, you concluded on a slightly ideological note, and that was a good thing. If this is what Social Democratic policy for the economy of the future looks like, then I must remind you that one of the most serious problems with the internet-based economy and Europe's backwardness is the lack of entrepreneurial spirit, which can be seen in the education system, in the actions of governments, and in the work of institutions. And it is precisely this that must be addressed to guarantee the knowledge-based economy of the future. Mr. President-in-Office, First of all, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament, especially because your visit symbolizes what the Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists has already pointed out here: that it is politically symbolic that, during your tour of the capitals, you have also come to hear the European Parliament. This is not the first time during the Portuguese Presidency that there has been a different and politically invigorating relationship between the Council and Parliament. But as Comrade Barón Crespo has pointed out, this is indeed a significant gesture, and we are happy to acknowledge it as such. Our position is clear: we support the Portuguese government's initiative because it is serious and because we identify with its content, both strategic and other objectives. This is also clearly reflected in the way this Council is being prepared. Firstly, the seriousness and thoroughness of the document presented in January. Then there are the various preparatory conferences, the contribution that both business and trade unionists are making to this summit. And above all, the recent contribution in the field of research, made at the conference bringing together Nobel laureates and ministers of science and technology. This demonstrates seriousness, a clear interest in the content of the summit preparations. But we also support the initiative with regard to the main objective already mentioned, because it not only brings employment and social issues back to the center of the European debate for the first time, but also because it once again appears possible to ""achieve the goal of full employment."" For years, many have said that this would be impossible, that it would not be possible again in the new societies. I congratulate you, Mr. President, on putting this issue back on the agenda without denying social cohesion and values that are fundamental to us. These values are not only the foundation of the founding project of the European Union, but also the foundation of our culture and, above all, our conception of the extent of solidarity necessary among all Europeans."	de
The lesson of the experiment in Europe is that it is precisely where wages are lowest and wage relations are most flexible that unemployment is highest, while where wages are highest and social relations are best regulated the unemployment rate is lowest. Mr President, this policy should arouse deep disappointment, not hope, in the hearts of European workers. With its resolution, our committee shows that, in addition to the Commission, the ECOFIN Council and the ECB, Parliament is also in favour of an extremely neoliberal socio-economic policy, which has had many negative repercussions on the living and working conditions of employed people and other large sections of the population in the Member States. Our committee has firmly rejected any attempt by the rapporteur to give, in the explanatory statement, a different dimension to the discussion on the economic situation in the European Union and to send certain messages to the Commission and the Council, different from that of Parliament, a body elected by the citizens of the Union. Even the positive contribution of international economic institutes and high-level experts, who have contributed to the reflection, has received a poor reception. With this resolution, Parliament is taking on serious responsibilities towards the citizens who elected it, because it supports an extremely neoliberal socio-economic policy which promotes widespread privatisation, claims to be against everything that is public, undermines workers' rights in the fields of employment, wages, social security and pensions, imposes a rigid financial policy with strong anti-popular and anti-social connotations and, giving voice to the demands of employers, asks workers to become more flexible if they want to find a job. My group rejects this concept outright and will therefore not vote in favour of the resolution. Mr President, the report presented by the Commission on the economy of the Union in 1999 seems to us to be vague because it does not explain at all why our results remain desperately below the potential that Europe's immense human resources should enable us to achieve. It is certainly pleasing to note that the 3% growth forecast for 2000, which may have seemed risky when the Commission formulated it in November 1999, now has a serious chance of being realised, and this in the context of low inflation, given that the peak of 2% recorded in January for the euro area remains, however, lower than in the past. One has the impression, however, that this growth, fuelled first by the results of the United States, then by the increase in productivity of the new economy, as well as by the new information and communication technologies, is being driven by the general trend of the world, and this despite our handicaps. We know these handicaps well, which must be remedied with extreme urgency; I am referring to the structural rigidities and excessive compulsory levies that have always characterised us. Let us not forget, however, that, with the single currency, a new one has been added. Indeed, the unification of monetary policies and the progressive alignment of other policies impose additional constraints on the euro area countries, forcing them to behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and economic circumstances.	it
I will conclude. I will not go into further detail: we will have the opportunity to do so at other times. But, it goes without saying, as one of the speakers pointed out, and I thank you all for your very positive and pertinent contributions, that we cannot afford to say again, in one, two or three years, that we have not done what we should have done. For my part, I can assure you, after having discussed this within the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present to Parliament and the Council the legislative measures, amendments and directives necessary to provide us with the highest levels of security. The political will of this Parliament is necessary, and I see that I can count on that will, as is that of the Council of Ministers. Thank you, Commissioner. We have taken due note of your availability. I have received eight motions for resolutions, tabled on the basis of Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to conclude this statement from the Commission. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon. Storms in Europe The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe. I call Mr Barnier, on behalf of the Commission. Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your comments, particularly for the very concrete proposals concerning the victims who are expecting enormous help from the European Union and the help we can provide. Personally, in the first days following this terrible storm, I sent you a letter asking you to request that the French authorities readjust the Objective 2 perimeters so that all areas affected by the storms, both in France and elsewhere, could benefit from Objective 2. I think this was done because you did not mention it. We all know that if you are not within an Objective 2 perimeter, you will have great difficulty obtaining aid. So, it's best to address this problem immediately. You also know that the problem isn't just a short-term issue, but also a medium- and long-term one. Let me explain. I was in Lorraine during that terrible storm that devastated about 20% of the deciduous forest. Indeed, for some so-called forest communities, 20% of which are affected, this represents an enormous loss. We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity. The loss that these communities will suffer will therefore not be spread over one year, two years, or five years, but over much longer. The communities concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years. I therefore think that it will be very difficult to compensate for the loss of financial income for these rural communities through subsidies. I believe that this is an aspect that must be etched in our minds so that we don't forget it in our various policies.	fr
If I had my way, I would wave a magic wand and harmonise excise duties throughout Europe, so that smuggling would no longer exist, except in cases where certain products are intrinsically more expensive in a given Member State. But I do not have a magic wand and I cannot do it my way. In this area, we need unanimity, as Mr MacCormick knows, and if the Member States do not agree on harmonising excise duties, that will not be possible. I repeat that towards the end of the year, the Commission will present a report on the excise situation and I am of course always available to discuss that report with Parliament. Community water policy (continuation) The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading on Community water policy. Mr President, the situation of fresh water in Europe is not as bad as in other parts of the world. However, the facts show that, while the demand for water has constantly increased, the quality of that resource has, on the contrary, decreased. To this should be added the problems of water pollution in the potential new Member States of Eastern Europe, as well as the recent rupture of a tailings pond containing cyanide in Romania, a disaster which could now affect the water pipes supplying the Yugoslav population. I understand that Commissioner Wallström, whom I thank for being here this evening, will be visiting the area. I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no Member of this House can refuse to recognise that this directive is essential to put an end to the current fragmentation of water policy and to facilitate the launch of a programme with specific measures for each river basin. It has been difficult and complex to draft, with many interests at stake and divergent opinions. There is no doubt that Mrs Lienemann, the rapporteur in this parliamentary term, has made great efforts and commitment to trying to reconcile and reconcile the positions, and has largely achieved her objective. However, it is almost impossible to know and assess all situations and expectations equally. I come from a country whose southern half faces the Mediterranean, a country where the availability of water has always been linked to the whims of a fickle climate and a complex conformation of the land. Century after century, year after year, day after day, up to the present day, the Mediterranean region has had to struggle against this adversity in order to develop. That is why we believe it is very important that this directive reaffirms the obligation laid down in Article 164 of the Treaty which requires Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions. In order to see this principle applied, the Spanish delegation of the European People's Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 - Recital 21 -, 13 and 49 - Article 11(d) -, which seriously limit the sphere of exclusive competence of the Member States, as in the case of the regulation of water resources. It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions of such regulation in the various regions, given the different internal balances that are always present, balances that require, in any case, a deep knowledge of the different areas and interests at stake.	it
In this situation, the policies of the European Union bear a great responsibility. Naturally, we must adapt these systems. In France, in particular, we must stop relying solely on the labor market to finance health insurance and pensions. Furthermore, we must reform the archaic administrative system, which is a source of injustice, mismanagement, and waste. In particular, we must pursue a family policy geared toward demographic growth, an economic, monetary, and fiscal policy focused on growth and the reconquest of our internal market, which contributes to job creation. The Commission's proposals and the Andersson report have nothing to do with social policy; rather, they are an instrument for granting Brussels excessive decision-making powers regarding the financing—that is, the organization and benefits—of the social protection systems of European nations. For this reason, we voted against this text. Social protection must, above all, be an expression of national solidarity, and it is primarily and exclusively the responsibility of the nation states. Social protection must be based on the principle of national and Community preference. Otherwise, it will merely serve to financially regulate the intolerable social conditions that result from immigration, to the detriment and disadvantage of European citizens. We did not participate in the vote on Jan Andersson's report on a concerted strategy for the modernization of social protection. Our fundamental attitude towards the European Union is positive. As Swedish Liberals, we view European integration as a way to solve cross-border problems, such as environmental issues, trade, international mobility, human rights, and conflict resolution. Here, Europe's democracies can show the world that cooperation leads to peace and prosperity. However, we also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, which means that decision-making must take place as close to those affected as possible. For this reason, we are actively working for a Constitution for the European Union that clearly outlines the distribution of competences for everyone to see. It must be absolutely clear to all citizens of the Union that the EU is concerned exclusively with the issues it is best placed to solve—cross-border problems. All other matters should be dealt with at the local, regional, or national level. Social policy is an example of an area where the EU should have only limited competence, except in cases involving the free mobility of people within the Union. Each Member State should have full responsibility and the right of self-determination for its social protection systems. Healthcare, childcare, and elderly care are clear examples of areas that are not directly cross-border. The same applies to employment policy. We do not believe that a common European legal framework in these areas will solve the problems of social security systems. We believe it is important that the Union instead focuses on a few issues where real benefits can be achieved. However, this does not prevent Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social field. Social security and equality have traditionally been high on the Liberal agenda. That is why we can fully support many of the proposals put forward in the Andersson report at the national level.	de
Mr. Barnier, I beg your pardon, but you have not fully answered the last part of my question regarding major energy transmission networks. Could you please provide an answer in that regard? Is the honorable Member concerned about whether the installation of nuclear power plants will be financed from the Structural Funds somewhere? I am being blunt. We could say that there is no need to even think about it. I told you, Honorable Member, that, under the Structural Funds Regulation, project selection remains the responsibility of the Member States. Consequently, the Commission services are not systematically informed of all the selected projects. However, the honorable Member is right to ask me; it is your job, and mine is to answer you. As has happened in the past, Member States are obliged to respond to the extent that the Commission questions them or requests clarifications. So, I will go a little further than the trust usually shared between the Member States and the Commission and look at exactly what this is about, in the specific case mentioned by the honorable Member. The Member State or States concerned should then reply to me, and I will forward their reply to the Honourable Member when I receive it. I thought I had already replied on the issue of large networks. The energy situation varies greatly across regions of the European Union, and aid from the Funds could be justified in certain cases and regions, particularly where connection to the basic energy networks is still underdeveloped. This is the answer I can give on this link between large energy transmission networks and the Structural Funds. - Question No. 46 by (H-0052/00): Subject: Structural Funds and Additionality. In light of the Commission's recent, careful reply to my priority written question on the Structural Funds and Additionality, could the Commission indicate whether it intends to amend the rules on additionality in any way? Would you be in favor, in particular, of modifying the rules so that additionality would not only apply at the level of the Member States but also within them, with regard to budgetary arrangements between central governments and regions or countries with internal self-government status? I would like to reply to Mr. MacCormick that the Commission has no intention of modifying the regulations on additionality, which, for the period 2000-2006, were contained in Article 11 of the general regulation of the Funds. As in the past, the principle of additionality applies, as provided for in those regulations, to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all—and I should say all—of Member State development expenditure. In this regard, it should be emphasized that the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds is that which must be additional. It is not mandatory that the co-financing provided by the Member State be additional, that is, that it be added to its expenditure. As long as the Member State does not reduce its overall own expenditure, the Structural Funds can be considered, and we consider them, to be complementary to national expenditure, and therefore the principle of additionality is respected. As for the budgetary arrangements applicable in the Member States, between the central government and regions or countries enjoying internal autonomy, these are determined by exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality, as formulated in the regulations.	es
So if she has any lessons to offer, they are in good hands in this House. She knows me well enough to know that, at all stages of our five years of working together in this House, there has not been a single occasion when I have not given full, official, and detailed information about everything I have done. Mr President, allow me first to pay tribute to the careful and, as I understand, dedicated work of Mr van Hulten in preparing this report. Although he has not been a long member of this House, he is in many ways an old hand, as a former civil servant certainly in his familiarity with the institutions, and I think that this excellence is demonstrated by his ability to tackle this difficult issue, which, as several Members have pointed out, is of vital importance to all our institutions. I thank him and wish him a long and successful parliamentary career. As you know, Mr Van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts had to be very long, and since I want to give a comprehensive response to it, particularly in relation to the issue of financial management and control, I should like to ask for your indulgence in this regard. Of course, I will not take up Members' time any longer than absolutely necessary. When the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts was discussed in this House last September, I gave an assurance on behalf of the new Commission that the report would serve as an essential basis for the proposals to reform the Commission. The House will see the efforts we are making to fully implement this assurance when it turns to the reform package adopted today by the Commission, which, incidentally, is well within the ambitious timetable we set ourselves four months ago. I am sure Mr Pomez Ruiz will find this encouraging. The vast majority of the proposals contained in the paper are very similar to those of Mr. van Hulten, and this paper contains—I say this to him and Mr. Staes—a very precise timetable for the actions to be taken in the course of the reform. For this reason, the report I had the honor of drafting contains no unresolved or ambiguous points. The opinion of this Parliament will be of great importance during the coming four- to five-week consultation period, for obvious reasons. I would like to reply to Mr. Elles that we are certainly in receiving mode. However, he will no doubt recognize, with his usual generosity, that in order to receive any response to our proposals, we must first transmit them. Hence the transmission. While time does not allow me to discuss all the elements of the motion for a resolution before the House, I am pleased to assure you that the details will be treated as important input for our reform proposals throughout the consultation period and, of course, for our work in other important areas. I now turn to the main themes of the motion for a resolution and would like to make the following observations.	de
"In this way, we will create a cooperative climate that will have a positive impact on the quality of reform. Parliament's representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to the negotiating partners that, by making institutional changes to the Union, we also assume responsibility for its constitutional development. They should therefore be aware that such issues cannot be resolved solely through haggling. The issues addressed by this Intergovernmental Conference are extremely sensitive. It may be easy to formulate solutions, but the question is to what extent these solutions will stand the test of time. I would like to point out two potential points of conflict. First, we have the balance we have maintained so far between large and small states. Europe is not a classic federal state and cannot become one. The solutions we decide on must be subordinate to the fundamental concept of the European Union, which is a union of states and a union of peoples. The other area where tensions could arise is even more complicated. In view of the impending accession of new members, we demand more efficient institutions from the future European Union. This means they must function more simply and quickly. However, the European Union is and remains inherently a complex and complicated multi-state institution. There are certainly opportunities for streamlining and simplifying it, but even here there are limits. If we overshoot the mark in favor of one-sided efficiency, then the legitimacy of the European Union will be called into question. I am, however, confident. Mr President, the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference must be broadened. The most important issue that needs to be addressed in this regard is the internal differentiation of the Union. Unfortunately, even here in the European Parliament, this has not been addressed at all so far, although it is necessary for the Union to be enlarged in the agreed manner. Former Commission President Jacques Delors once again publicly raised the idea of a European confederation, pointing out that the vanguard countries at the forefront of the union should move forward faster than others and, for the sake of clarity, establish their own institutions. The current Commission President, Prodi, and High Representative Solana, have expressed similar views. In the opinion adopted last November, the Liberal, Democrat and Reform Group took a position on internal differentiation, proposing a system of concentric circles for Europe, the ""onion model."" In the next resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference, Parliament should really examine the issue of differentiation and flexibility in depth. If we fail to create the system of concentric circles proposed by the Liberal Group, both enlargement and integration will be at stake. My colleagues, Mrs. Frassoni and Mr. Onesta, have already expressed some skepticism about some aspects of the issue we are currently debating. I would like to add a word of concern about the issue of subsidiarity, not only between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Member States and their own autonomous regions. This has not been given due consideration so far, even though there are many issues here that give cause for concern. I would like to focus in particular on one of the implications of enlargement for this Parliament. The upper limit was set at a maximum of 700 members so that this Parliament can continue to fulfil its role as a consultative assembly."	de
Thank you, Mr. Medina Ortega. I fully share the regrets you express. Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I can, with supporting evidence, contact the competent authorities of both Air France and the French government? I truly believe that this is no longer possible, and we absolutely must protest in the strongest possible terms. Madam President, I had the same experience as Mr. Medina Ortega yesterday. I believe that the French authorities—who have the honor of hosting the seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg—must realize their responsibility to guarantee adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union. Absolutely, Mr. Napolitano, thank you. Madam President, this is not about flight delays: I would like to apologize for the absence yesterday of my colleague from the Green Group, Caroline Lucas, who is a British MP. She could not be present because she was arrested during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow yesterday morning. Her identity was taken down: it became very clear that she is an MEP, but she was nevertheless detained all day. I consider this to be absolutely unacceptable and I will ask you – I have also written to you with my colleague Mrs Hautala on this subject – to intervene with the British authorities to ensure that such incidents do not happen again and that an apology is offered to Mrs Lucas. Thank you, Mr Lannoye. I have received your letter and I have already intervened with the British representation. Madam President, with regard to today's vote, I would like to ask something that I already raised yesterday, during the oral debate on the EQUAL report. I am asking for a postponement of the vote on the EQUAL initiative, because we simply need a little more time to resolve an important point. I am optimistic and I truly look forward to the vote with serenity and confidence; We will find as broad an agreement as possible for this position on EQUAL. We only need a little more time to sort out the details on the asylum issue, and I therefore ask that we vote tomorrow rather than today. Madam President, following up on Mr Lannoye's point: Ms Lucas was arrested outside Glasgow for demonstrating against the Trident base at Faslane. I have a great deal of sympathy for that demonstration. However, I have no sympathy for Ms Lucas trying to hide behind her parliamentary immunity. I, for one, was also arrested for demonstrating at Faslane. I did not hide behind my immunity. I accepted the sanction that was imposed on me. Ms Lucas should do the same. Madam President, I would like to come back to Ms Stenzel's request to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow. Indeed, this initiative was the subject of a fairly lively discussion within the committee and, since it is an important proposal from the Commission that relates to the agreements reached last year, I believe it is acceptable. We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request for referral is justified in order to find the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative by the largest possible majority.	fr
Already last autumn, we heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for police forces. I am pleased to hear that Mr Javier Solana will be holding a meeting of the Interior Ministers next weekend to discuss the issue of police action. I hope that this discussion will focus primarily on Kosovo, so that a solution to this desperate situation can be proposed. Still on the subject of the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will follow the wish expressed by Parliament - and if I am not mistaken, also by the Commission - to see a budget set aside over several years for action in Kosovo. Mr Solana, the events in Kosovo have taught us several lessons: we have learned, for example, the need, in order to deal with crises, to equip ourselves with a military capability that we have already put to practical use. But another equally important lesson must be learned: namely, that it is better to prevent crises rather than be obliged to intervene after the fact. The EU therefore also needs an independent and credible capacity for conflict prevention. As far as the Commission is concerned, Commissioner Patten has already taken several commendable initiatives in this regard. I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military actions, as well as to create headline goals for non-military actions and a Commission crisis centre. The last question I would like to address to Mr Javier Solana is: what concrete preparatory work has been carried out in this area of conflict prevention? How was it organized in Mr Solana's department, and how was it coordinated with the work of the Commission? Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Liberal Group, but we would like to remind you of the enormous responsibility that now rests on your shoulders. I am thinking, among other things, of humanitarian, peacemaking, and peacekeeping operations. But I am also thinking of the responsibility,² which is now yours, to ensure that the new European defense cooperation does not create the slightest division between NATO and the EU, nor between the USA and Europe. Such a division would only delight despots and rogue states that threaten freedom and human rights. You have, I believe, heard the concerns expressed last week in our Parliament by some members of the American Congress. You must ward off these concerns, Mr. Solana, because, as you yourself said, if we are united on both sides of the Atlantic, we can do something. If we divide ourselves, we weaken ourselves and thus prolong the suffering of the oppressed. Therefore, Mr. Solana, maintain the closest contacts with our American allies, without forgetting Norway, Turkey, and Canada. It is also largely thanks to them that we will not become paper tigers. We have, as Mr. George Robertson has often said, two million soldiers, but we were not even able to field 40,000 in Kosovo. Perhaps it was our weakness and lack of credibility that led to the war.	fr
But beware of the fact that this backfires on the workers and the unemployed, who are told that everything is getting better and better, when they find that their lives are not improving, but, on the contrary, are getting worse. This is the main ideological struggle for Europe that we face. I think this debate sums it up perfectly. The main political divide was evident tonight, and it is no surprise that this issue has polarized the debate in an Assembly known for its capacity for consensus and distinctive politics. I am pleased that this difference of opinion can be seen so clearly, because this is a radical report. This report is a wake-up call for Europe. This report recommends radical measures that will, essentially, make recruiting staff easier. It's that simple. The reason we have such exorbitant unemployment rates in Europe is because, in many cases, recruiting staff is too complicated due to red tape, regulations, and the inflexibility of labor markets. It is the only way we can move forward, because the true way to guarantee social justice in Europe—and that, after all, is what we are here for—is through the creation of prosperity, opportunities, and jobs. This report clearly points to the most effective way to do this, because Europe needs to wake up. You cannot create jobs solely through public spending. You cannot create jobs through legislation to reduce working hours, as if jobs were a cake to be sliced and divided among people. The real world simply does not work like that. And if Europe wants to be left behind, left behind in stagnation, unemployment, statism, and corporatism, then yes, vote against this report tomorrow. But if you want Europe to move forward and begin to respond to the people of Europe, then I would like to ask you all to support this report, because it will provide those jobs and those opportunities, and because it is the only way to achieve that. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, Giorgos Katiforis's report, in its original version, had the great value of extracting from the specific observations in the Commission document on the economic situation in Europe, strong guidelines for a European Union strategy capable of providing continuity and stability to the prospects for sustainable development that are emerging in 2000 for all the countries of our continent. These guidelines referred to the need for effective coordination of the Union's economic policies, and to overcoming the separate management of economic and social policies that until now has represented a serious obstacle to defining a coherent strategy to combat unemployment, with a view to full employment. Dear Mr. von Wogau, it is this lack of governance in the European economy that is, at least in part, determining the weakening of the euro. The document also referred to the creation of a European research area and the promotion, in all EU states, of convergent measures in the areas of research, lifelong learning, and employment, overcoming all forms of unfair competition between states in tax matters.	es
Of course, the relationship with Armenia is an element of these external relations, as the agreement signed last year shows. We believe that if Turkey wants to come to share the fundamental values of the European Union and the general framework of its relations - regardless of the bilateral idiosyncrasies it may have towards another country -, in general terms it will have to behave according to the basic models adopted by the European Union in its external relations. We are also sure that this issue will be one of the priorities in the bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future. Question No. 6 by the Honourable Member (H-0122/00): Subject: Ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo Since the end of the NATO and EU bombing of Yugoslavia to prevent the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians by Serbia and the arrival of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200 000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 have been murdered, with the result that there has been comparatively more ethnic cleansing of Serbs than by the Serbs themselves. In recent days we have witnessed the murder, as always, of Serbs by Kosovar Albanian mafias with impunity. What decision does the Council intend to take to put an end, once and for all, to this ethnic cleansing and to ensure respect for human rights for all the people of Kosovo, irrespective of race or creed? I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his answer, but I would also like to point out that, statistically, there is more violence in Kosovo now than there was before the NATO bombings. It is worrying that the bombings have aggravated the situation, and it should be acknowledged that NATO and the European Union made a mistake in taking that decision. The President-in-Office of the Council spoke rightly - there is no doubt - about Belgrade's faults, but it should also be remembered that the secret services of the USA, Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain continued to supply weapons and money to the KLA, a mafia in other words, to help create problems in the area. Therefore, we are all to blame. I would like to ask a supplementary question on the global context. Do you not think that it would be appropriate to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to restore greater economic normality to the area and allow Kosovo, as a province of Serbia, to benefit from it? Mr President, I am not a friend of Milosevic or his government. However, I have very serious doubts about the legitimacy of NATO's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, both because of the lack of authority of the UN Security Council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on Serbia's sovereignty at Rambouillet. The current situation in Kosovo, where the ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Roma is now complete, speaks for itself. Shouldn't NATO at least acknowledge the error of deliberately targeting the Belgrade TV tower and killing 20 civilian journalists, which remain a serious moral stain on the management of the war and now open up the embarrassing prospect of possible war crimes indictments against Western leaders?	it
This will lead us to make CULTURE 2000 the citizens' programme. This increased participation of our citizens, which I strongly hope for, must be as broad and fruitful as possible. For my part, I undertake to work so that, over the five years over which the programme will be structured, this participation becomes a tangible reality. I know that you parliamentarians, in your regions, in your countries, are working with the participants in the programme so that all these little flowers, as a colleague said, become a vast multicoloured carpet. I would like this programme to become a tangible reality and for culture to represent for us citizens not only a factor of enrichment, both on a personal and socio-economic level, but also a right that must be affirmed and the sign of a newfound understanding within the Union. This is the contribution of our European programme CULTURE 2000. It is not a competition with the cultural policies pursued in the various Member States, which are necessary and I would like to see them developed even further. It is simply a complementary addition, a bridge between the different cultures of our different countries. Broadening and enriching the participation of European citizens in culture therefore seems to me to be an essential task that justifies our efforts. We must measure the success of our action and that of our Union by the yardstick of culture. Many Members of Parliament have argued very appropriately that if a Union is made up solely of economic elements, it is stillborn, but if it is made up of culture, civilisation and participation, then it can live. This is the basis, ladies and gentlemen, that I intend to develop, taking into account in particular the following five lines: offering innovative opportunities to our creative people so that their talent finds in our programme the support it deserves; encouraging exchanges, mobility and training in the cultural sector; encouraging cooperation between cultural operators; broadening the audience by giving particular importance to young people; and finally, safeguarding and making better known the common heritage of European importance and the history of the European peoples. I am sure that the new programme, thanks to its structure and its organisation based on transparency, efficiency and balance, will be a competitive and irreplaceable instrument at the service of our action. Madam President, I thank Parliament for its support and for having once again demonstrated the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the Union. I am sure that it will not be disappointed by its support and I undertake to inform it personally of the various stages of implementation of our action, of the action of our citizens, which I hope will be significant for the future of the Union. Thank you, Commissioner. I think we can once again thank our rapporteur. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00. (The sitting closed at 9.55 p.m.) End-of-life vehicles The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position of the Council for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on end-of-life vehicles [8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)](Rapporteur: Mr Florenz).	it
During the budget procedure, we were told that the funds for Kosovo had to be approved quickly, and now, according to our information, no calls for tender have yet been published or carried out. This is serious, because it is delaying the entire process of reconstruction in Kosovo. Finally, and this is the logical conclusion of my remarks, we call on the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets regularly, monthly, about the status of expenditure implementation. We have documents that speak of fixed commitments. We don't need fixed commitments; we simply need commitments, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, above all, what has not been paid. Kosovo has suffered enough from payment delays. Mr. President, when we talk about Kosovo today, as we have often done, we should also take stock of what has already been done in Kosovo, or whether anything has been done at all. I think some small steps have already been taken toward normality, and one should at least mention them once in the context of such a debate. Starting February 9, there will be a so-called interim council – it's called the Kosovo Transitional Council – in which both the political parties, the minorities, and civil society are represented, and which is intended to be a kind of interim parliament. This is good, we welcome it, but I think they also need to be given a tool and a strategy for what they are supposed to prepare, because elections are planned for the fall. No one really knows what these elections will lead to, or what kind of parliament they will become. No one knows what powers this parliament will then have vis-à-vis UNMIK. That means there are a whole host of imponderables that we aren't informed about, and that others probably can't properly assess either. The very Albanians who are now being integrated into this interim council should actually have a bit more of an idea of what awaits them. In addition to economic work and reconstruction, we must also consider establishing coexistence among Serbs, Albanians, and other minorities – including the Roma – in this country, so that, hopefully, reconciliation can take place through coexistence sometime in the near future. I want to enumerate once again the actual things we can be happy about. There are now 34 tax inspectors in the administrative sector. That's fantastic! People are now being encouraged to pay their taxes there too, because in the long run, it can't be sustainable for everyone to depend solely on the coffers of the EU and other donors; some of this must come from our own resources in this area as well. It must also be noted that four of the 19 departments already have administrative leadership, which is also an improvement over what we had there previously. We also have something very important for the constitutional state that we want to establish. We have 130 judges and prosecutors who have now been sworn in and who can begin their work to administer justice there, to enrich the culture of tolerance there and, of course, to at least get to the bottom of the crimes and then be able to hand down convictions.	de
I wonder, however, why we can't talk about public health. It's an important part of social protection that is immersed in a kind of crisis—which also costs a lot of money and is important to many people—and which the Council obviously isn't going to talk about yet. Then Mr. Barón worried me a little because he said that the program you're presenting, Mr. President, is fundamentally a social democratic program. I then reflected a little more on his speech, and indeed, I believe there is an issue in it that was clearly social democratic. It is the point about designing the macroeconomy in such a way as to create jobs. If you implement good macroeconomic policy, it obviously leads automatically to greater job growth. We've already seen that. But on the other hand, the sound rules of macroeconomics cannot be abused by overly specific. We would then end up in a situation that many economies governed by the social economy or social democracy have experienced or still experience, whose ultimate victim is employment, due to a misguided macroeconomic policy. This must not happen. Therefore, I hope that the Prime Minister will not propose to cancel the macroeconomic policy we have pursued in recent years, which has brought us much success, or to change it in such a way that it is no longer effective. As a final point, Mr. President, I have a problem with the Portuguese Presidency documents and, to some extent, also with those of the Commission, and that is their defensive nature. There are some countries in Europe, including Denmark, but also the Netherlands and Ireland, that have performed as well as the United States in the area of employment. In other words, it is possible for Europeans to match the United States. There are other countries that have proven no less capable. It is therefore much more prudent to investigate why some countries are doing so badly, why some regions are performing so badly, rather than saying that we are all doing much worse than the United States. It seems to me that this is not entirely true in general terms, even less so when we take into account that the internal market has only been operating since January 1, 1993. And that is a relatively short time. Mr. President, Prime Minister Guterres has been convincing. The presidency's proposals contrast with the usual EU jargon. European citizens do not want a theological debate; they expect concrete actions. According to Professor Fitousi, the greatest deficit currently threatening European society is the deficit of the future. Many of our fellow citizens fear a future that has been painted black for them for two decades. The slightest accident is presented as an irreversible ecological catastrophe. Science is often demonized. The result: young people are increasingly less oriented toward scientific studies. People are asked to be flexible, to participate in the frantic race for productivity.	es
Human rights should not be limited to a reading limited only to the moment of denunciation or punishment. As Parliament, we must approach the issue of human rights above all from the perspective of prevention. In this sense, we must be able to export a culture of legality, a culture of law, and the appropriateness of law. I believe that a long period of piling up treaties and treaty signatures has definitively come to an end. Today we have many, perhaps too many, treaties that refer to the issue of human rights: if these treaties are reduced to a mere enunciation, they are merely examples of useless thinking. Today we must move to a subsequent and necessary stage, that of the daily and mandatory application of what is written in our treaties, although we must not forget that some fundamental treaties still have to be incorporated. I am referring to the Rome Conference, since 14 of the 15 states of the Union have not yet ratified the Treaty on the International Criminal Court. I believe we must review and modify some of the political instruments through which we measure the quality of human rights on the planet. We have often used instruments that, from a formal point of view, may be convenient but, from the point of view of political results, are absolutely useless. I am referring to the use, and often abuse, of the embargo over the years and the overly cautious application of the suspension clause in agreements between the European Union and third countries in the event of human rights violations in those countries. I believe we must update the horizon of human rights protection. Globalization risks being interpreted in a particularly punitive way. Currently, in many countries, the principle of the universality of human rights is being called into question. Many human rights, including the right to life, denied by the death penalty, are considered dependent variables, while globalization, often understood in a punitive sense, risks becoming, in fact, the only network that holds together the rights, actions, and policies of all countries. Consequently, we must update our scope of action in this effort to protect human rights. I'm thinking of social rights, workers' rights, the quality of work, and the need to ensure respect for all the criteria that have been indicated, as they should be, by the International Labour Organization. I'm thinking of the right to tolerance, the right to respect, which is a right of all minorities, especially within the European Union. I'm also referring to the right to development, which is a right of peoples who are themselves a collective of individuals: every individual, within the people to which they belong, has the right to development, to a future that is above all a place of hope and growth. I believe that all of this is part of a reasoning, a debate, and a contribution that the European Union must make to the field of human rights.	es
The Commission cannot, however, accept amendments Nos 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 81(rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107. Thank you for your attention. (Parliament declared the common position as amended approved) Report (A5-0033/2000) by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection (COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution)President. This concluded the voting. EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000) I welcome the quality and ambition of the report on LIFE. I would like to point out briefly that LIFE is a financial instrument at the service of environmental policies in the European Union and in third countries, be they neighbouring Mediterranean countries, countries bordering the Baltic Sea or candidate countries. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has proposed several amendments, most of which have been taken into account in the common position adopted by the Council. For the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004), this instrument will be divided into three axes, LIFE-nature (47% of resources), LIFE-environment (47%) and LIFE-third countries (6%). In my opinion, the most important changes concern: LIFE's contribution to sustainable development in the Community and to the promotion of Community policy in the field of the environment, in particular with regard to the integration of the environmental dimension into other policies, and its contribution to the implementation and updating of environmental legislation; improving the effectiveness, transparency and methodology of LIFE's implementation procedures, the procedures for informing and disseminating information to the public and those for cooperation between beneficiaries; the objective of LIFE, which must consist primarily of sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have also had the opportunity to express my views; the contribution of projects aimed at promoting the sustainability of socio-economic activities and, consequently, the creation of jobs. What seems essential to me is that the LIFE instrument will remain open to the participation of the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The other candidate countries (for example, Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) will also be able to participate in LIFE when agreements to this effect are concluded with them. The main obstacle in the negotiations with the Council is the level of the financial envelope envisaged for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004). The Commission proposal approved by the Council is EUR 613 million, while the Committee on the Environment considers that the amount should be EUR 850 million. I support the rapporteur's firmness. Since the creation of the programme, in fact, the financial envelope has never been adjusted, not even on the occasion of the transition to fifteen Member States following the enlargement of the European Community. If the report is adopted in plenary, a conciliation procedure, as foreseen by the codecision procedure, will have to be initiated to resolve the issue of the amount of appropriations foreseen for the programme.	it
"At the beginning of this decade, we must plan how our institutions will develop internationally until the end of this decade, and particularly what place we should occupy within international monetary bodies, what place we should occupy within United Nations bodies, and so on. We must open this debate. In conclusion, this morning, the day after Valentine's Day, the newspapers announce that your honeymoon is over. I don't know whether you are romantic or not, Mr. Prodi. Perhaps that is a very unromantic statement for such a day. However, we in the Liberal Group welcome it because we believe it means that we have now seriously set to work. That is in the order of things. Considering the many adjectival descriptions you used for Europe during your speech – an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe with a human face and that is inclusive – allow me to define, in a word dear to the hearts of my liberal colleagues, in two words, the Europe that we want to see outlined in your governance plan: a Europe of possibilities. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I have great respect for your frankness in admitting that the European Union must change completely. You reflect on major issues of principle in your programme. I believe that citizens will begin to take a greater interest in politics if we are able to raise major issues as well as the small, everyday matters. At the same time, however, it must be noted that your programme unfortunately resembles a party programme in many respects. It does indeed contain many good intentions, but concrete proposals on how to achieve all this are largely lacking. Like any party program, it also contains several internal contradictions. With my intervention, I would like to help you identify these internal contradictions. First of all, the economy and social development. We must be able to think about how to reconcile the objective of competitiveness with the objective of full employment; this is therefore mentioned in your program. Finally, should there be a convergence criterion which—as you actually suggest in this program—would aim to ensure that unemployment in no Member State exceeds, say, the rate of the three countries that have been most successful in this area? Ecological tax reform is what my group wants to emphasize. We can indeed only create jobs and sustainable development by changing the structure of taxation, but unfortunately—as we all know—this is an area in which the European Union is completely incapable of acting. I urge you to raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference. The European Union can only achieve legitimacy by focusing on tasks that individual countries cannot handle alone. Parliament certainly agrees with you on the importance of supranational decision-making in this regard. An internal contradiction in your report is related to globalization. I think you have a lot of merit in raising the notion of ""global control,"" as others here have noted."	fr
I hope and trust that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these proposals, and I look forward to your comments and your position on them. Finally, I would like to welcome the report on competition from the Commission's DG XXVIII, to which a considerable amount of work has once again been devoted. However, as I have already mentioned, our ultimate goal must remain transparency and clarity. There is still a need to improve efficiency in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore sufficient reason to continue working with a view to resolving the problems related to the lack of transparency and clarity in the field of State aid. This is particularly necessary in relation to the upcoming enlargement, and I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Jonckheer, who has very thoroughly addressed in his report all the problems related to enlargement and how to ensure that these countries meet our requirements and also that we compete on a level playing field. It is clear that as liberals and Greens we have different worldviews; however, we largely agree on our objectives and will try to find a reasonable solution to our problems. Mr. President, Commissioner, we simply have to answer two questions. Are state aid to companies legitimate, or are agreements between companies legitimate in a market economy, and who should oversee these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy? Regarding the first point, we openly affirm that, in order to take into account the needs of sustainable development to which the European Union subscribes, it is essential that in certain cases there be state aid to companies, whether in the form of tax relief, a differentiated tax regime, or simply direct aid. It is equally legitimate for agreements between companies to exist, self-limitation agreements, all those agreements that make it possible to mitigate the harmful effects of competition on social or ecological needs. We therefore answer quite clearly yes: it is legitimate for aid to exist, for agreements to exist, but we affirm that each of these agreements must be expressly subject to reasoning. The von Wogau report proposes returning the control of this legitimacy to the national level. We find this relatively dangerous, but we will nonetheless vote in favor, because we recognize that the Commission cannot do everything. We demand greater transparency and that the Commission be given greater powers of investigation to verify ex post the legitimacy of these exceptions. Mr. President, once again we are debating the European Union's competition policy. However, under what conditions is this debate actually taking place, and what conclusions should we reach? What characterizes the current reality is the materialization of gigantic takeovers, mergers, and acquisitions of enormous monopolistic companies and the formation of tremendously powerful global groups. Frankly, shouldn't our debate address this situation? What competition policy is willing and able to establish controls on the actions of these monopolistic companies?	es
We are changing the law so that it becomes enforceable again; I find this unacceptable. The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions. Given this planned system of legal exceptions, restrictions on competition are automatically exempted, provided the requirements of Article 81(3) of the EC Treaty are met. The need for notifications in Brussels is eliminated, meaning that the Commission will be flying blind in this regard in the future. I find this unacceptable. The Commission's concept is supplemented by increased ex post control by national authorities and the courts of the Member States. However, if this continues as part of a renationalization, we will end up with a patchwork of competition policy in Europe. I believe this is unacceptable. A core element of European policy is being weakened here. The systemic change in European antitrust law envisaged by the European Commission is highly risky from a competition policy perspective. We have sufficient other options within the existing system to ensure open markets and free competition. Moreover, with its proposal, the Commission is returning to old proposals that were already put forward in the 1950s and 1960s. They failed to gain a majority back then. Because France placed such a strong emphasis on the legal exception at the time, it was compensated with concessions in agricultural policy. Forty years later, this proposal is now back on the table, and I am certain it will create scope for the formation of cartels to the detriment of European consumers. I do not consider this acceptable! Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, in this important debate on competition policy this morning, I would like to comment specifically on Mr. Langen's report on the Steel Aid Code. As the European Court of Justice recognized in 1996, the iron and steel industry is particularly vulnerable to disruptions in the competitive landscape. Incidentally, I reached this conclusion several years ago in a report on the strengths and weaknesses of the European iron and steel industry. It was therefore entirely legitimate to introduce an aid system for this sector to ensure the survival of efficient companies, even if this contradicts Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty. This is precisely the aim of the Sixth Steel Aid Code. At the same time, however, it is important to avoid any infringement of competition rules and any serious disturbances of the equilibrium of the markets, and this aid must therefore be regulated. State aid must therefore continue to be limited to research, development, environmental protection, and closure aid. In the same vein, it is paramount that Member States fulfill their obligation to account to the Commission for the aid they have granted to their steel companies. The Commission proposes shortening the deadlines, and I agree with this request. Like the rapporteur, while welcoming the Commission's report, I regret that not all aspects of steel aid are addressed. Although the Steel Aid Code is very clearly drafted, the Commission has approved aid to steel companies that do not fall within the categories listed in the Code. In the interests of equal treatment, the Code must either be applied or amended. Finally, Mr President, let me say that with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the rules must be revised, because I believe the aid system must continue beyond 2002. Therefore, I am in favor of a Council regulation that ensures certainty in this area.	de
(Applause) Madam President, we Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned, and fortunately many of our colleagues are as well. The coalition agreement being finalized in one of the Member States is certainly an Austrian issue, but there is no doubt that it also has a European dimension. Because what unites us in Europe are, first and foremost, the values and principles of freedom, democracy, and respect for human rights. The president of the Austrian Liberal Party, Haider, has repeatedly expressed his contempt for these values. He also disdains the most basic forms of diplomatic courtesy. He is a dangerous man. The Christian Democratic parties in my country made the choice long ago, and remain faithful to that belief, to heed the protests of far-right voters, but never to negotiate with far-right leaders. Values must come before power. We therefore regret what is happening in Austria. Indeed, we are completely shocked. We are deeply disappointed. We call on the ÖVP to ultimately seek other solutions. We continue to insist on Article 6 of the Treaty. We continue to fight against the trivialization of the far right. If a government is ultimately formed with this coalition, then we call on our ÖVP colleagues to ensure in their program, both in words and deeds, that the principles and values that are the foundations of European integration are respected. President, ladies and gentlemen, Austria has a great responsibility here. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that in this Parliament we largely agree on rejecting Haider and his policy, but it is also clear that we have differences on the question of how this policy can be most effectively combated. Have you ever wondered what the effects are in Austria of this debate here and of the Council Presidency's statement last weekend? Have you ever asked yourself whether we do not also bear responsibility for the subsequent development of the political situation in Austria when we set ourselves up as judges here? Have you ever wondered what would happen if a colleague's wish were granted and elections were held in Austria in the coming days? According to the consistent reports from all observers, Haider would emerge even stronger. Who could possibly want this? Don't we have a responsibility to consider how we can combat this policy? Europe is a community of law. Among the principles we must defend are those of democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. The democratic mandate includes the fact that even if we don't like the decisions taken in the elections, we respect them, and therefore we must respect it if the Austrians, for reasons rooted in their politics, decide as they have. It is a matter of the rule of law that the Council Presidency does not express itself as it has, in a way that contradicts the Treaties.	es
"We must prevent this, adopt preventive measures to avoid this type of disaster from happening again. This is the meaning of the oral question we have put forward on behalf of all the Members of the Fisheries Committee. We hope that the Commission will present concrete proposals: actions, not lamentations. Parliament will today approve a joint motion for a resolution from several parliamentary groups, which I consider, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to be very important and timely. Mr President, the sinking of the Erika on 12 December off the coast of Brittany caused an oil spill, the effects of which on the environment will be felt for many years. In addition to the destruction of natural resources, we must add the serious impact of this disaster on certain economic sectors, fundamentally those dependent on fishing. The situation could get even worse with the 20,000 tonnes of crude oil remaining in the compartments of the grounded vessel. For the aquaculture and oyster farming sectors, helpless in the face of the pollution that has irremediably reached the coasts, the results have been very serious from the very first days and also subsequently, due to the loss of market share in these sectors and the rejection by consumers of a guaranteed product but affected by this pollution. Ladies and gentlemen, these are peripheral regions whose economic balance is unstable and which have been deeply affected by this oil spill, which is unfortunately not an isolated incident. This region - like other neighboring regions - relies mainly on natural resources. A nature too often punished by human activities that could be avoided if the public authorities had greater control over them. ""Prevention is better than cure,"" they say. The budget says so too. Ladies and gentlemen, preventive measures are much less expensive than repairing the damage caused by disasters of this magnitude. Mr Fischler says he is present whenever Parliament calls him. However, in the Erika affair, he gave the impression – perhaps not to us, but to the people of Brittany and Vendée – that, as Commissioner for Fisheries, he was not there or only partially there. As Parliament already pointed out in the first resolution of 20 January, the needs of the fishing, oyster farming and tourism industries must be taken into account as affected sectors. This is why we have asked the Commission to adopt urgent measures for the fishing sector, by mobilising specific funds. Galicia and Brittany, the two Finistère regions of Europe, have both been affected by these oil spills. We do not understand why disasters such as the Urquiola and the Amoco Cadiz have not served as a lesson to strengthen legislation in the maritime transport sector, both in terms of safety controls for the transport of dangerous goods and in terms of flags of convenience. We ask that this be the last time. We ask that lessons be learned and that we hurry to amend our legislation and close the loopholes that mean that we are always faced with the unbelievable, and that this unbelievable is nevertheless true. The ""polluter pays"" principle seems to us not only necessary, but also justified."	fr
Established in March 1969, it is officially required to meet every two years, but in practice, it meets annually and makes its decisions based on scientific advice. The organization then issues recommendations for the conservation of stocks. The organization has four standing committees, composed of national experts, covering the areas of research and statistics, finance and administration, compliance, and conservation and management measures. There are also four working groups for tropical tunas, northern and southern temperate tunas, and other species. These working groups are empowered to initiate regulatory measures for species covered by the convention. Proposals from these working groups are submitted to the Commission, which then proposes recommendations to the contracting parties. These recommendations are binding, but contracting parties have a six-month period during which they may object. As a contracting party, the European Union is obliged to transpose such recommendations into Community law. During its session held in Santiago de Compostela in November 1998, ICCAT recommended certain amendments to the rules on minimum landing sizes for bluefin tuna. ICCAT also issued recommendations in 1974, 1994 and 1996. From now on, it is prohibited to land or sell bluefin tuna of age 0, weighing, of course, less than 1.8 kilos. During the November 1998 session, the ICCAT Standing Committee on Research and Statistics was asked to conduct a new assessment of the bluefin tuna populations in the western and eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The committee would thus provide the organization with the information necessary to review, develop and improve stock recovery plans. It was decided that the SCRS should present a study during the 1998 session, highlighting various possible scenarios for stock recovery, to levels that could produce maximum sustainable yield, taking into account the various variants of possible levels of recruitment and stock mixing. In addition, the SCRS study should indicate monthly closures for purse seine fishing, so that closures would be more effective for the conservation of bluefin tuna. As a result of this research, the session agreed that, instead of imposing a blanket ban on purse seine fishing for bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean during the period 1 to 31 August, a more selective approach should be implemented. It is important to protect tuna fisheries for future generations. Bluefin tuna is the most expensive fish in the world, fetching up to €90,000 per tonne daily at the Tokyo auction. The importance of Mediterranean tuna is evident in the fact that it accounts for 70% of all landings in the region, estimated at nearly 30,000 tonnes. Of this, 80% is caught using purse seines. The Mediterranean is an important spawning ground for bluefin tuna, so it is important to take the necessary measures to strengthen the protection of juveniles. We must respect the minimum size and implement technical measures if we are to eliminate catches of fish aged 0. The measures adopted in November 1998 came into force on 21 June, I repeat, 21 June 1999, almost nine months ago, several months before the communication was sent to the Committee on Fisheries. I believe, Commissioner, that this is not enough and that in the future we must learn the lessons from this.	fr
"However, the truth is that the Commission's guidelines do not fully comply with these objectives. On the other hand, it is important to have precise guidelines and sufficient funding in the areas of quality job creation with rights, as well as the effective promotion of equal rights and opportunities, in support for the social and solidarity economy, rural development, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, and improving the quality of life of urban populations in needy areas, particularly in the social housing sector, with a view to sustainable urban development. (IT) While the content of Article 158 of the Treaty is aimed at promoting harmonious development throughout the Community, we must say that achieving the elimination of disparities is still far off, or rather, in some cases, such as for the Italian regions that are part of Objective 1, paradoxically, disparities are increasing, especially due to the still limited capacity of the structural apparatus to adapt to Community procedures and the persistent cumbersome nature of the procedures. In fact, despite regulatory initiatives, the streamlining of Community structures has yet to be achieved. Without administrative simplification, it will be difficult to achieve the Community's objectives of reforms inspired by efficiency and concentration. In this regard, the Commission document lacks any recommendations to Member States aimed at simplifying national procedures and regulations regarding the submission and processing of projects by national authorities, as well as financing, action, and oversight. Small and medium-sized enterprises, microenterprises, and artisans, in particular, remain ""weak subjects,"" given that the regulatory and administrative hurdles imposed by some Member States, including Italy, pose significant obstacles to their access to the Structural Funds. A considerable handicap is the inability and impossibility of the regions and other stakeholders to program in a timely manner. Therefore, the Commission, which, based on Decision 97/99 on the guidelines (Howitts report), should have consulted Parliament at the time, in fact found a kind of convenient excuse in establishing the reduced programming phase in the Member States and published the guidelines in July 1999, before the newly elected Parliament began its legislative activities, thus preventing Parliament from influencing the current structure of the guidelines. For this reason, the mid-term assessment of Article 42 of Regulation No 1260/99 will be very important. In general, the current guidelines lack clarity and transparency. Despite their importance, they only address the possibility of measuring progress against verifiable objectives fully aligned with Community policy strategies. They do not sufficiently address the implications of enlargement, as they contain no specific provisions or clarifications on this matter for either regional or national authorities or for the candidate countries. That said, the different approach to the guidelines, which, aside from geographical objectives, are based on sectoral policies, can be positively assessed."	es
The exhaustive collection of data that is proposed and its appropriate processing will be valid elements for addressing the revision of the common fisheries policy with greater rigour. All this, of course, if the data is obtained. Because, as the rapporteur rightly points out, the Commission proposal does not contain any element of obligation towards the Member States. The transmission of data by the latter is voluntary while failure to submit them will only result in the loss of a certain economic compensation which, moreover, is not even very high. With the experience gained on the submission of data in the fisheries sector and I am referring to the reports on the fulfilment of the MAGPs, I believe that instead of a detailed picture of the situation in the sector, we will find ourselves faced with a confused panorama in which some Member States will transmit, for example, scientific data, but not data on employment, while others will provide data on employment but not on the situation of resources, depending on whether they can, or want to, obtain and transmit them. Of course, I am very much afraid that some will prefer not to get funding if they can continue to hide their mismanagement, which has already been seen even in cases where data transmission was mandatory, as in the case of the POPs mentioned above. Given this shortcoming, which I consider the most serious, the report of the Committee on Fisheries improves the proposal in some interesting ways, especially with the rapporteur's suggestions on more reasonable deadlines for submission and with the request for a check by the Commission. My group has supported two requests that I consider reasonable. The first suggests that, in cases where the collection of a series of data proves interminable, data from studies and samples should be used. The second suggests that data strictly linked to the fiscal aspect of companies should be eliminated from the Commission's proposal, taking into account, among other things, that such data does not fall within the competence of the Community. In the light of all this, I believe that the report is appropriate and, on behalf of my group, I ask for its approval. I would first like to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on preparing and presenting the report. I support the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data, which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various fish species. It is important that this data is both economic and environmental and that the information provided by the Member States is standardised throughout the European Union and, as highlighted in the report, brought into line with international provisions. I support the allocation of funds for national programmes, also taking into account the provisions to be observed in relation to minimum programmes. I agree with the proposal that the Commission should also be provided with the information intended for international organisations. Otherwise, the purpose of data collection and aggregation would be lost and, in the absence of information, a cautious approach would continue to be applied. It is in the interest of the industry that the information is concrete and based solely on facts.	it
". Women suffer from growing inequalities because they are victims of sexist discrimination that can be exercised openly (violence, rape, sexual harassment, domestic violence, etc.) but also in a more insidious way. This oppression is based on a sexual and social division of labor that values the work of men over that of women. Wages are unequal, their work is still perceived as ""side work"" and more generally, female employees do not have access to the same positions of responsibility as men. In addition, family responsibilities fall mainly on them. Women must have the right to full-time employment, just like men. Coercive laws must be passed to promote professional equality. States must develop a public service for early childhood care. Finally, to allow everyone to engage in public life, there must be a massive reduction in working hours. There must be a real diversity in political, economic and social life. We oppose the idea that the biological difference between women and men gives rise to two different world views and two different value systems. Women have the right to be present in the decision-making process as ""individuals"" and not as representatives of the female sex. My colleagues in the British Conservative delegation and I are fully committed to addressing the need to increase the number of women playing an active and full role in public life. We share the regrets expressed about the persistence of inequality and discrimination on the basis of sex, and in particular about the under-representation of women in politics. However, we are not convinced that one discrimination should be countered by another, namely the introduction of quotas to guarantee seats for women. I feel this particularly keenly because on Thursday evening, my 27-year-old daughter, Caroline, was selected as the Conservative candidate for the constituency of Southampton Itchen in the United Kingdom. She arrived at this position entirely on her own merits and as a result of competition against all participants. We should not adopt a position that in any way diminishes the position of the growing number of women who are showing that they can assert themselves in public life without fear or favor. The members of my delegation and I therefore supported a large part of the resolution, but we oppose the call for positive discrimination in favor of women, which we believe would not be a good way forward, but would actually be degrading to women and distort the democratic process. Accordingly, we abstained in the final vote. Katiforis report (A5-0041/2000) Mr President, I voted in favor of the Katiforis report on the performance of the European Union's economy in 1999 as a matter of group discipline, because it exposes an extremely serious shortcoming that it will, I hope, help to eliminate in the coming years. This report does not clearly explain, or even explain at all, that the economy of the States of the Union also and above all depends on the way in which the funds allocated to pensions, taken from workers, are used."	fr
If we allow Europe to be diluted by enlargement, we will drown in our own political quagmire. Mr. President, there are days when I truly cannot understand this Parliament, which takes a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation. After having limited its participation in the IGC to two small posts of its own accord, Parliament today refuses to complete the agenda of the IGC. Indeed, whether out of weakness or foolishness—and neither option is truly glorious, as you will recognize—our Parliament, by rushing to give its assent, abandons the only means of action conferred upon it by the Treaty, namely, that of demanding, as a preliminary matter, a complete agenda for the IGC before making a decision. Why should we vote for this assent tomorrow, February 3, in a hurry, when we could wait, in a position of strength, for the opening of the Strasbourg session on February 14, and thus impose on the Council a finally complete and, therefore, coherent agenda? No small amount of hypocrisy was needed to mask our current weakness. Hypocrisy that we must bitterly regret in our resolution: that the agenda of the IGC falls short of the imperatives, when, by rushing forward, with culpable naivety, we deny ourselves the possibility of imposing this more ambitious program. If at the end of this IGC there are democratic gaps, I must say that the responsible parties will be the political groups that have encouraged this haste. Whether we like it or not, as our Parliament will itself extinguish the only spotlight that allowed it to shed some light on the debates, the locus of decision-making will now shift to the fifteen states of the Union. Therefore, I ask the Members of the vast majority of this Parliament who in November considered that the future of Europe deserved broader debates than the remains of Amsterdam to take up their pilgrim's staff and go and convince their government that this IGC should be expanded, since the Helsinki Council resolution allows for it. Because of the situation in Austria, this day is a dark one for Europe. We realize then that the victory of democracy is never definitive and that we must convince and convince once again. To affirm our fundamental values, it is urgent to put them in writing, and, apart from this IGC, I believe we owe Europe a constitution. Mr. President, the motion for a resolution we are discussing calls, as before, for the future Intergovernmental Conference to have a broad agenda, one that includes the profound reform of the institutions. The future enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this. I am convinced that this conception is flawed. A federal EU, tending toward centralization and increasingly governing the member countries, will, in reality, be in a worse position for enlargement. A flexible EU, concentrating on fewer but more important issues and respecting differences and national democracies, will be better able to encompass many more countries.	es
Throughout this Conference, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the status of the negotiators that is important, but also the quality of what they say. And I want to remind your Parliament once again, given my experience before Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status that was granted to the two representatives of the European Parliament before Amsterdam, the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a great deal in these negotiations. I am sure that it will be the same, and as far as I am concerned, in my position, I will ensure that the ideas put forward by your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations. I am sure that the European Parliament will not be a spectator of these negotiations, any more than the Commission will be a spectator. We now await, ladies and gentlemen, with great interest, your subsequent opinion in which you will specify Parliament's priorities and concrete proposals for these negotiations. It is of great importance that the two European institutions that will be present in these negotiations, the Commission on the one hand, the European Parliament on the other, alongside the members of the Council, clearly explain to the citizens of the Union, always and every day explain to the citizens of the Union, what the issues at stake in this Conference are and what responses we recommend, as European institutions responsible for ensuring the smooth functioning of this enlarged Union and the common interest. In the coming months, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission will therefore work in close consultation, in good understanding, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Elmar Brok, in order to bring our points of view closer together, if necessary. Our points of view and positions will probably not always be the same; there will undoubtedly be differences, as is normal. What is important is that there is consistency, and it is to work towards this consistency that I have committed myself since the beginning of my duties within the College. We therefore have the concern and the ambition, on a very large number of issues, to be on the same wavelength and to take these negotiations to the next level. This will not be by chance, since, I repeat, it seems to me that we have the same ambition for these negotiations and we feel together that it truly constitutes a moment of truth for the European Union. Finally, I would like to make three additional observations, quickly, Mr President. First, to congratulate and thank President Napolitano and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely strong and original initiative that was taken yesterday in bringing together the qualified representatives of the national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate. This dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important. I also said that I would play my part by going myself before each of the national parliaments.	fr
If amendments were adopted that weaken the directive, it would be extremely detrimental, not only for the environment but also for the European Parliament's credibility on environmental issues. It was pointed out in today's debate that we must not forget the millions of people who find work in the car industry, nor countries with a highly developed car industry, such as my own country, Sweden. I myself was a car worker before my election and am certainly one of the few people in this Parliament who has stood on an assembly line and assembled cars. I believe that the automotive industry must be subject to high standards, as this favors modern, environmentally conscious, and rapidly developing car manufacturers. And it is precisely this type of car industry that we must promote in the European Union. Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for Parliament, as well as for the citizens of Europe. Old vehicles pollute the environment and pose a serious threat to it, and our citizens expect us to represent their interests in this regard. Every year, eight to nine million cars are scrapped in the European Union. This alone generates a huge amount of waste. Vehicle and parts manufacturers, as well as material suppliers, must strive to limit the use of hazardous substances as far as possible. It is therefore important to ensure, right from the design phase, that recycled materials can be used in vehicle production. We know that the Netherlands has approved treatment facilities for the collection of end-of-life vehicles, and I believe we should introduce these throughout the European Union. As far as Ireland is concerned, I am aware that the Irish Department of the Environment has begun consultations with representatives of the automotive industry with the aim of establishing suitable end-of-life vehicle collection centers in Ireland in the near future. In my view, there is no reason why concession agreements should not be concluded across Europe for treatment facilities to dismantle the eight to nine million vehicles withdrawn from the European Union each year. Car manufacturers must provide information on the reuse, recycling, and recovery rates for used cars they intend to achieve in the coming years. Under the new provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the 370 million consumers in the European Union have a right to consumer-specific information. I am convinced that EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that introduce the most environmentally friendly practices in the coming year. Finally, I would like to say that relevant regulations and laws should take into account the special position of the classic car sector within the European Community, which plays a particular role in social, economic, and environmental matters. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive undoubtedly marks a milestone in the improvement of the environment in our European Union. I also believe that enormous efforts have been made to ensure sound material recycling, reduce environmentally harmful waste, and promote technological innovation. From this point of view, we are certainly on the right track, but, as some colleagues have already pointed out, the real problem is that the manufacturers may be left to bear the responsibility alone.	de
"Mr Rübig has the floor. Mr President, fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions against a Member State because a democratically elected government has been formed there. Both parties have already participated in the government. They have not committed any legal violations to date. Are preventive sanctions compatible with the Charter of Human Rights? Would a right of veto by the President of the Council over national government formations be compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights? Is calling for violent demonstrations compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights? Mr President, as President-in-Office of the Council, I have no answer to give you for the simple reason that the position taken by the Portuguese Prime Minister, on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union, took place at a bilateral level and not at that of the Presidency of the European Union. I would like to say, however, that the set of preventive actions that have been adopted on a strictly bilateral level by the Member States of the European Union concerns a set of actions of a nature, I would say, of political prophylaxis on a diplomatic level, which seems to us perfectly justified and which seems to us to be in line with what is reasonable in the face of the behavior of a party and of personalities in this party who do not seem to give the guarantees of being able to fulfill the aims of the Union, in the government of which it would be a part. I would not like to dwell on this question on behalf of the Presidency of the Union because this is an intervention that my government made at the request of and in collaboration with fourteen Member States and not as the Presidency of the European Union. Mr President, I have the honor of being part of the Convention that drafts the Charter, so I will not ask the Presidency to speculate on its content or whether it thinks that the Convention should be declaratory or whether it should have legal force. I would like to know what will happen to the draft charter that the Convention is currently drafting. Will the Council treat it as a document that it must accept as is, or will the Council consider itself free to amend this document? Will the Council simply say yes or no to this draft, or will it be in a position to rework this draft charter once again? The answer is neither yes nor no. I don't know, Mr. Deputy; it will depend on the decision taken at Council level. Question No. 8 of (H-0042/00): Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and consequences for the construction of the Ilisu dam in Turkey. The G8 meeting in Cologne invited the OECD to initiate a process of establishing common standards in the area of granting export credit guarantees. Indeed, these guarantees can be used to distort competition and finance dubious projects. Will the European Union take the lead in launching this process? The need was demonstrated recently when the British government announced that it was ""willing to grant"" an export credit license to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey."	fr
It must be clear that subsidiarity applies, that is, it must be made clear that we will not legislate in areas where it is not necessary. The second problem concerns budgets. Given a growth rate higher than the 2.5% in the financial perspective, we can consider slightly different measures with regard to budgets than we would otherwise have done. On behalf of my group, I would like to warn the Commission against shifting agricultural spending from Category 1 to Category 4 at this stage. In Great Britain in particular, agriculture is in desperate straits and is desperately hoping for some support for certain parts of the sector. Shifting the appropriations earmarked for agriculture from one budget category to another would send out the wrong signals at this stage. Finally, a word of caution on the issue of information. This problem has strained relations between our Parliament and the previous Commission because, under the Treaties, we have, in principle, access and the right to access all information. It looks as if there may be difficulties with our framework agreement. I therefore stress that we must resolve this issue as soon as possible and that there must be no restrictions on documents accessible to citizens if we want the Commission and Parliament to work together. As Mr Bonde quite rightly stated, the aim is to create a European Union in which there is a free flow of information between administrative structures and all our citizens. President of the Commission, when you took office, you said that the Commission should be characterized by transparency. This has been mentioned several times today. But what is the situation now? Why are Commission press conferences no longer broadcast live by satellite so that everyone across Europe can follow them? I hope Mr Prodi is listening. Mr President Prodi, regarding your letter to Mrs Fontaine on the question of the Ombudsman, do you understand that the Ombudsman is bound by a principle of loyal cooperation between the institutions? Where do you find a legal basis for this in this case, and do you believe such a principle could suppress the Ombudsman's right to express himself freely to the press? Furthermore, with reference to your letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal, I would like to raise the following fact. There, you refer to a seminar on transparency held in April as evidence that the regulation was drafted under transparent conditions. This seminar was organized by the European Federation of Journalists, Members Lööw, Thors, and Hautala, among others, but the proposal discussed there has nothing to do with the current one. The latter was drafted in complete secrecy. Above all, however, Mr. President of the Commission, the question arises as to whether the principle of sincere cooperation should take precedence over the principle of freedom of expression. What is the basis for such a principle that you could use to suppress this right and confront the Ombudsman with such demands? Mr. President, I will simply address some aspects of your very ambitious and comprehensive report.	de
Why should I not say that we have observed, on the part of the Greek Government, in recent years, a certain deficiency in the application of the new regulation and the previous regulation for the association of representatives of civil society. I say this objectively and when a problem or a deficiency is observed, this problem or this deficiency must be eliminated. Therefore, I will ensure this in the context of the implementation of the new Community support framework. I call Question No 45 of (H-0041/00): Subject: Structural Fund financing of research in the field of civil nuclear energy. Can the Commission confirm that in the last programming period of the Structural Funds 1994-1999, no support was allocated to research in the field of nuclear fusion and fission? Can it also undertake to exclude any measure of financing of this type of research in the current negotiations with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new period 2000-2006? What role, however, will the contribution of the Structural Funds play in promoting renewable energy? Can we expect Structural Fund financing in the area of energy policy to be focused on promoting regional and renewable energy resources? Will the Structural Funds also finance major energy transmission networks? I would like to respond to Mrs Isler Béguin on the first point and remind her that improving the scientific base and technical capabilities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the Community priorities during the previous programming period. The support allocated by the Structural Funds for technological cohesion, that is to say, research and technological development within the context of the Community support frameworks during this period, is estimated at approximately EUR 7.5 billion. This, Madam Deputy, is approximately 6% of the total Community contribution. Specifically regarding your concern, I would like to tell you that, as in the previous period, the Commission does not intend to directly finance research and technological development in the field of nuclear fusion or fission through the Structural Funds. It remains the responsibility of the Member States' managing authorities to select the projects that are implemented within the framework of these CSFs. Therefore, Madam Deputy, even if this is not a Community priority, a Member State may decide to finance research and development projects in the field of civil nuclear energy, provided that these projects contribute to regional development and without systematically informing the Commission. As regards your second point, which, as you know, interests me and continues to interest me greatly, renewable energies, the Commission's approach is presented in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund. These provide that investments in the renewable energy sector should be encouraged to the extent that they promote the development of local resources, contribute to reducing dependence on energy imports and also create local jobs. I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit I made to Portugal a few days ago to the Azores, a natural source of renewable energy. The contribution of the structural funds, in favor of greater penetration of the renewable energy market, was also highlighted in the campaign for the take-off of renewable energy sources, launched by the Directorate-General for Transport and Energy.	fr
"Three issues still need to be addressed. The first concerns the transfer of water between catchment areas. This affects my colleagues in Spain, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Amendments 4, 49, and 87 would be unacceptable because they would limit a country's ability to redistribute water from areas where it is abundant to areas in need, such as low-rainfall areas or cities. Second, while we must set targets, they must be realistic. A look at Amendment 7, which calls for the total elimination of naturally occurring substances, shows that some of the targets set are unrealistic. Furthermore, some of the targets envisage values close to zero—a formulation that makes little sense in English. We need to look at this in more detail. The term ""continuous reduction"" used in Amendment 58, on the other hand, is much better. Third, I would like to address the issue of Scotch whisky. The production of Scottish whisky, and especially malt whisky, the finest whisky, requires the extraction of considerable quantities of water, which are then returned to the river. Some of the water, however, ends up in the bottle and is drunk. We must ensure that Amendments Nos 49 and 87 do not revoke the exemption, so that it is still possible to enjoy high-quality whisky. In this context, this means that good Scottish peat water must be used. My third request, therefore, is that we examine these measures thoroughly before adopting the measure as a whole. Mr President, first of all, let us denounce the utter hypocrisy of those who claim to be dedicated to the environment and water, yet at the same time, through criminal acts such as the attack on Yugoslavia, have not only caused thousands of deaths and injuries, but have also caused enormous ecological devastation, including to water resources, thus rendering them not only unusable but even extremely harmful to health. As for the report itself, we believe that the application of the cost-recovery principle for water services must under no circumstances lead to additional taxation of economically weaker sections of the population, or even to the extinction of small and medium-sized farmers, who may then no longer be able to afford to irrigate their crops. We also point out that in regions with acute water shortages, such as my country, and particularly on the islands, water-saving infrastructure projects must be financed. This saving cannot be achieved by increasing costs, but by increasing quantities, particularly by collecting rainwater, which currently remains unused, flows into the sea, and causes soil erosion with all the resulting problems. In this respect, we support Amendment 107 by Mr Marset Campos. It is also necessary to ensure that life in regions with chronic water shortages is safeguarded through the optimal use of river water. The Council's assertion, which the Commission also endorses, that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because these points are covered by the examples in the directive or are included elsewhere, can only be understood as nitpicking. This is intended to continue operating in a rather opaque area, as it makes it possible to codify critical decisions in favor of big business during the initial implementation phase of the directive."	de
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I need not repeat what the rapporteur has said, nor what Mr Coelho has already said. All of that is true and correct. The euro can easily be counterfeited. We are in a dangerous transitional phase in which, in criminal law terms, a phenomenon is occurring that is – I believe, perhaps unique in the history of the monetary system: that money that does not yet exist, that is not yet in circulation but exists only as book money, can nevertheless already be counterfeited. However, because it is not yet in circulation as currency, the crime of counterfeiting cannot yet take effect at that point. A very complicated problem. This means that if we do not act quickly – and Mrs Cederschiöld is right about this – we could already make a few counterfeit euros and possibly not be held accountable for putting them into circulation. For some, I would like to say in passing, this may be an attractive prospect. What is the European Union doing about it? Mrs Cederschiöld has described many correct things, but in connection with what she has described, Parliament must comment less on the content of the framework decision, and less on the report Mrs Cederschiöld has written on it, but rather on the procedures that are being applied. The European Parliament has been consulted by the Council, by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, in a manner that mocks the very concept of democracy. We have been sent a text for consultation that the Council itself has been tinkering with for a very long time, only partially successfully, incidentally – I will come to that in a moment. The European Parliament is now expected to comment on this complex, difficult, and at times contradictory Council document within three months. It is only thanks to the tremendous commitment of Mrs Cederschiöld, and to the European Parliament's refusal to exercise its democratic right to conduct its consultation procedures in sufficient time and with all texts available in all languages, that we can now reach an opinion and thus the decision due in March within the timeframe requested by the Council. On such an important issue as counterfeiting or protection against counterfeiting, and the harmonisation of criminal law that is necessary for this, we cannot really work at the breakneck pace that the Council is demanding. Therefore, on behalf of my group, I want to make it absolutely clear here: We have discussed at length with Mrs Cederschiöld whether it makes sense to work in this way. We have concluded that it does not, but in view of the importance of the subject matter, we have agreed to accept the procedure as it is. This framework decision is without doubt a step forward. However, the legal certainty actually desired by the Council - as Mrs Cederschiöld has already explained - will not be fully achieved in the end, because these deficiencies have not been remedied in the desired minimum standards, the minimum standard of criminal liability and, above all, the application of the same criminal law provisions in all Member States - even in those that have not yet adopted the euro, but in which counterfeiting could theoretically occur.	de
Evidently, we are paying the price of our own carelessness because our countries, with the blessing of the Community, have deemed it appropriate to no longer have their own merchant fleet and have allowed a profound expertise in shipbuilding to disappear, we no longer have clear traceability of ships and we see real garbage ships plying our seas under flags of convenience, at the mercy of the short-term interests of multinational companies. We absolutely must put an end to the avalanche of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners, complacent classification societies. Today, the greatest confusion reigns. These issues obviously need to be addressed at a global level, but the current international rules of the IMO are completely insufficient and too lax. Neither our countries nor the Commission have tried tenaciously to make them more rigorous despite previous catastrophes. Of course, there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, the FIPOL, but it dilutes responsibilities and provides for ceilings at an insufficient level that needs to be reviewed. The issue of flags of convenience must be reviewed at the IMO. To this end, it is up to the Member States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives. I recall that the Erika was flying the flag of convenience of a State that is a candidate for membership in the European Union. On the other hand, there are Community directives that are, however, little or not at all applied due to the insufficient number of national controllers. This deficiency must be remedied urgently. A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years but is progressing at a very slow pace. From this point of view, there is unacceptable inertia and unacceptable cowardice on the part of the Commission. The date for the presentation of the Commission communication on this essential problem has been continually postponed and is now scheduled for July but it must absolutely be brought forward. The provisions on the matter that need to be provided for must be clear and severe. I will mention three that our group considers to be priorities. First, the liability of the owners of the oil cargo must be clearly determined and the victims of pollution must be able to appeal to it without any ambiguity. For the future, the best prevention will be the certainty for charterers of a heavy civil, criminal and pecuniary sentence, if they are not sufficiently vigilant about the safety of the ships they choose. Second, it is necessary to impose as quickly as possible, without putting it off until the Greek calends, the condition of double hull for oil tankers allowed to sail in Community waters. Third, it is urgent to set a strict age limit for ships allowed to sail in Community waters: it could be 15 years at the most. In the absence of a sufficiently clear, severe and rigorous Community regulatory framework, Member States that wish to draw one up should be authorised to do so in order to protect their populations and their territory, just as the United States learned a lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster by requiring double hulls and banning from their waters all ships over twenty years old. For this reason the United States had refused the Erika access to their waters.	it
To achieve the above objectives, both the resources and the policies of the new program financed by the Social Fund for the period 2002-2006 must be used, with the support of the Commission. The Commission will closely monitor the extent to which the Greek government fulfills the commitments it has entered into. I thank the Commissioner for her reply. But, Commissioner, the situation is this: in terms of unemployment, we rank second in Europe at 11.3%—it wasn't that bad before—we have the highest increase in unemployment figures and the lowest expenditure on the unemployed, namely less than 1% of GDP, while other countries (e.g., France, Belgium, and Germany) spend 3-4%. Furthermore, it is not clear how the resources provided by the Social Fund, among other things, to combat unemployment have been used. You mentioned that the Commission has issued some recommendations. That's all well and good, but we really hope that these recommendations will be followed up on. However, I have long been preoccupied with the following question: What happened with previous policies? Did anyone find work? How many obtained positions? If you cannot provide us with figures for the current year, then for last year or the year before last. What about training and continuing education? Are the infamous training centers intended to provide jobs for those who train there, or for those who are trained there? Is there any concrete data on this? Do we therefore have any means of monitoring the outcome of the Greek government's policies? Mr. Papayannakis, in response to your question, I can only say that the Greek government must indeed intensify its efforts to electronically record statistical data relating to existing structures so that the implemented programs also produce the quantitative results you mentioned, and so that the situation can be monitored and used as a basis for developing appropriate policies. In Greece, there has been an increase in the employment rate and—as far as I can see—productivity growth. The Commission can intervene where specific guidelines are concerned. As is well known, each country is assessed against 22 guidelines. These relate to access to training opportunities, broken down as a percentage for men and women, and special measures for the long-term unemployed. The Commission will endeavour to quantify the data for all the specific objectives and to arrive at concrete figures on the basis of the implementation of the new framework of Community action for the period 2000-2006. Question No 36 by (H-0782/99): Subject: Danish early retirement scheme. Can the Commission say whether the Danish early retirement scheme has been approved as a whole, and whether there are any differences of opinion between Denmark and the Commission in other social policy areas? Under the Danish pension system, Efterløn, only people residing in Denmark who have completed the required number of years of service in that country are entitled to a pension. Some workers have complained to the European Commission that they are not entitled to a pension. However, the Danish authorities consider that Community law does not oblige them to pay this compensation to workers in early retirement if they do not fulfil the conditions laid down in Danish law.	de
The sticking point in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the financial envelope provided for the third stage of the LIFE programme (2000-2004). The Commission's proposal, endorsed by the Council, is for 613 million euros, while the Environment Committee believes that the budget should be 850 million euros. I support the rapporteur's firm position. Indeed, the financial allocation has not been adjusted since the creation of this programme, nor even during the transition to fifteen Member States following the enlargement of the EC. If the report is adopted in plenary, conciliation will have to be opened, as provided for by the codecision procedure, to resolve the question of the amount of appropriations provided for the programme. This type of procedure is common practice since programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets that are inadequate to match their ambitions! Böge Report (A5-0023/2000) As a Member of the European Parliament, and especially as a citizen-consumer, I welcome the European Commission's proposal, which represents a further step towards greater food safety within the European Union. This proposal is twofold: firstly, it amends the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by deleting the provisions concerning scrapie in sheep, and secondly, it introduces a new regulation laying down rules for the prevention and control of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species. The advantage of this new legislation lies in the fact that it creates a specific legal basis for combating scrapie in sheep. I am all the more pleased as this was one of our main requests in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis. It also seems to me essential, for the sake of consistency, to merge the existing legislation on scrapie, limited to trade in sheep and goats, into a single, comprehensive set of new rules governing TSEs affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of food or feed. This regulation is particularly welcome given that doubts still exist about scrapie in sheep. Some scientific hypotheses suggest that scrapie in sheep may have evolved to become BSE in cattle and thus be the cause of the BSE epidemic. Although the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention and control of certain TSEs needs to be clarified and strengthened, particularly with regard to the detection and control of scrapie, it represents a significant improvement. It is a pledge to European citizens who have repeatedly expressed their concerns about European food policy. Their concerns, relayed by our European Parliament, have been heard. Debates on the precautionary principle, traceability, responsibility, and transparency have led the European Commission to present a White Paper on food safety. This White Paper launches several avenues for reflection and, in particular, proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority. All of this is part of a European strategy to regain consumer trust.	fr
Mr President, I would like to sincerely thank Commissioner Patten for showing such awareness of the difficulties of the peace process and the challenge facing the European Union to make this process a reality. In the Middle East, it is truly time for peace; it is time to complete the historical phase that began with the Balford Declaration in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli War of 1948; it is time for every country in the region to have secure borders, for political, social and economic rights to exist, for human rights to be recognized and practiced in Syria, Palestine and Israel, everywhere. For every people and every individual, it is also a question of sovereignty and democracy, but for this to happen, it is essential that each party in conflict has the courage to promote peace and respect for rights, that it recognizes the other as a partner and not as a subject to whom concessions must be made. I am referring primarily to the Palestine-Israel nexus, but this also applies to the Golan Heights, occupied since 1967, and South Lebanon since 1982. Israel must assume its responsibilities, withdraw from the occupied territories and share water resources, but at the same time, it must be certain of its own security and be able to live in peace by practicing economic and political exchanges with all the countries in the region. Security, however, is not only a matter for Israel. This applies to other countries, first and foremost to the Palestinians who still live under military occupation and who, even today, despite the agreements signed since Oslo, see their land confiscated in Areas B and C. After Oslo and up until October 17, 1999, 174,000 dunans of land were confiscated, 8,462 of which were confiscated under the new Barak government: trees were uprooted, houses demolished again, and, especially in East Jerusalem, water use was reduced or even banned, while settlements continue and are constantly increasing. However, there is no doubt that the elections for the new government have made progress possible; at least negotiations are resuming. Nevertheless, in the Middle East, there can be no stable and lasting peace unless the Palestinians have their own state and can move freely within their territory. The international community simply needs to implement Resolutions 332, 248, 245, and 194. We are concerned about the postponement of relations with Syria, as well as Prime Minister Barak's decision to postpone the Israeli military withdrawal and the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements. We believe it is vital that the European Union play a political role in the negotiations equivalent to its role in economic aid. We cannot simply remain in the wings; on the contrary, we must be leading actors, without risking a collision with the United States, as Minister Gama said.	fr
In fact, one gets the impression that they both believe that the Petersberg tasks will eventually be taken over by the Union's defense policy. The Treaties also point in this direction, but they leave even greater room for a more general defense policy that is closer to the old discourse on the integration of our policy into a European bloc. We would therefore express ourselves via this European bloc within NATO. To tell the truth, I hear less and less about this. I have the impression that the European Union has reduced its ambitions to the Petersberg tasks and that Mr. Patten is in charge of civil affairs, including the rapidly mobilizable police and civil service corps, which he rightly spoke about with enthusiasm, while Mr. Solana is in charge of military means and military engagement, all in a perfect spirit of cooperation. This seems self-evident to me. But is there really nothing else? In terms of defense policy, isn't the emphasis being placed on NATO's role in collective defense? The European bloc, which no longer functions as such, is limited to the Petersberg missions. Is that really what we want? There is also talk of the integration of the Western European Union into the European Union, but there is no longer any mention of Article V, which we are, of course, following very closely since it deals not only with Petersberg, but also with broader defense missions. Is that article being removed? There is also talk, generally speaking, of increasing defense budgets. I think that's a good thing, but no clear distinction is being made in this plea between the Petersberg missions and the broader collective defense missions. I wonder how the situation is developing. I would actually like to ask Mr. Patten and Mr. Solana how they ultimately see things. Is it necessary to pay greater attention to this at the IGC, or can this flow naturally from the Treaties? I am pleased that an opening has been created in terms of defense policy. But I wonder: what will happen if Turkey proposes a brigade? Will we have to allow this country to take part in decisions concerning this policy? Structurally, there are Haiders within the Turkish government. This seems strange to me. The Baltic states are also presenting themselves. Will they also participate in our defense policy? This is, to say the least, a very interesting situation. Mr. High Representative, you effectively recalled the progress made in this area between Amsterdam and Helsinki, as well as some of the decisions taken after Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and the decision to create the contingent of 50,000 to 60,000 troops, decisions also taken recently, at the informal meeting in Sintra. This acceleration, however, makes the gap between these decisions and the current Intergovernmental Conference even more evident.	fr
"Of course, we must not lose sight of competitiveness, but social protection must be designed in such a way that it contributes to economic growth and employment. I believe this is also made clear in the report. Following the unanimous decision of the Council, our aim is to begin next year with coordination, exchanging views, recording social problems and setting up a database to improve policy coordination. I agree with many Members that a first important step has been taken. A broader approach to social policy issues will already be evident at the Intergovernmental Conference. We should now have entered a new phase in which social policy is to a large extent a European policy. Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. WIPO Treaty The next item is the debate on recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141(AVC)). Mr President, we are taking a position here on an important issue: an international treaty in an area which can influence the development of prosperity in many Member States. In my home country, Sweden, for example, one of the largest export sectors is affected. This concerns music and sound recordings, and the right of artists to copyright protection for their artistic products. The subjects under discussion are the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty). Without intellectual property protection, financial incentives and creativity are stifled. Counterfeiting has now become big business. In Europe alone, revenue losses of €4.5 billion are estimated due to piracy, a problem that also affects many jobs in the entertainment industry. This is a historic treaty because the European Union is one of the contracting parties, even though only the member states, not the EU as such, belong to the organization. There is a special clause requiring Parliament's consent in two cases. As far as this treaty is concerned, both conditions are met: a new institution, an ""Assembly,"" is created, which will continue to deal with the treaty and its effects in the future. Furthermore, the treaty concerns issues that must be dealt with under the codecision procedure. Thus, Parliament must give its consent, as its competence is involved. Time will tell whether it is right to limit the Commission's competence in these matters through this new parliamentary assembly. In any case, Parliament cannot take any action in this regard at this time. The treaty complements the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary Works. It establishes international legal protection for distribution, sale, rental, communication to the public, and making available to the public, as well as protection for computer programs and databases. However, problems arise with the term ""author,"" as this term, for example, is not defined. Another issue that could lead to complications is caching. The treaty contains a general clause for this, but it does not contain a definition."	de
When the United States and NATO, and ultimately also the EU, reacted, it was already late, very late. Much suffering could have been avoided, particularly if the EU had acted earlier and more clearly. The EU therefore has a special responsibility to assume when it comes to helping and assisting the Balkans in their reconstruction. Our priority objective must be to create the necessary conditions for all the countries of south-eastern Europe to be integrated, along with the others, into the EU – economically, commercially and politically. The best way to create the breeding ground for democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is through trade and economic integration. The members of the Liberal Group are prepared to act quickly and thoroughly, as Mr Paolo Costa said. That is why we welcome with the greatest satisfaction the proposal for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Macedonia that has been presented to us, and we thank Mr Swoboda for the high quality of his report. Macedonia deserves our support, especially considering the sacrifices and selfless work made by its people and leaders during the Kosovo war. As Macedonia struggles to extricate itself from the destructive trappings of communism and nationalism, it is incumbent upon us to act unequivocally and offer our support. And we must do the same for the other Balkan countries. This is an imperative duty for the EU. Mr President, allow me here to remind the members of this House – linking this to a topic we discussed earlier this evening – that the man who bears the primary responsibility for this war, for the violations of human dignity, for the murders and for the expulsion of innocent people from their homes, continues to rule what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia. This man, who is accused of genocide and who is due to appear before the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague, is still at large. I am talking about Mr. Milosevic. As long as he remains in power and Serbia has not embarked on the path to democracy, this country will represent a threat to peace in the Balkans—including Macedonia. Mr. President, the proposed agreement will constitute the first application of the Stability Agreement in Southeastern Europe. It is obvious that the terms of this agreement, which the Swoboda report adopts, do not have peace as their objective but rather greater political and economic control of the country, the exploitation of its natural resources, the hyperexploitation of its labor potential, and the use, to a greater extent, of the country as a bridgehead against other countries and peoples in the region who resist the new order. And all this in exchange for the promise of future membership in the European Union. The report accepts these guidelines, as well as the European Union's broader policy towards Southeastern Europe. It is typical that the report congratulates FYROM for its constructive attitude during the NATO attack, praises its peacemaking role, and accepts the stationing of NATO forces on its territory. Naturally, the popular exasperation, manifested in mass movements during the NATO bombing, is ignored.	fr
A lot. Mr President of the Commission, when reading your White Paper on the reform of the Commission, one cannot help but notice that the guiding principle, the idea underlying this reform, is something very trite, something we in this Parliament cannot accept. This guiding principle essentially consists in protecting the Community's financial interests. This is, of course, a concern for all of us, but it is only the starting point. The Commission must begin its work on this basis and fulfill its obligations under the Treaty. Let me give you an example, because I don't have much opportunity to explain this idea in the time allotted to me. Take the reform you mentioned in relation to infringement procedures. What is envisaged? Simply that it is a matter of managing the resources available at each level, rather than responding to this Parliament's demands for the creation of a genuine administrative procedural law for reasons of legal certainty, which is necessary from the point of view of the European citizen, that is, from the point of view of those who can initiate these infringement procedures. It is simply stated that this administrative procedural law is not created, but that the actions are selected. How? The way these things are selected is purely arbitrary. From the perspective of this Parliament, such conclusions cannot be accepted. We understand that the Commission must be reformed, we share the objectives of this reform, but of course not in such a way that, for the sake of an important interest that is in the interest of all of us—namely, the protection of the Community's financial interests—the great impetus for European construction is thrown overboard, an impetus that it is primarily the Commission's responsibility to provide, due to the obligations imposed on it by the Treaty. Thank you, Mr. Prodi, for your presentation and your documentation. Congratulations on making the internet available to the general public—a very good idea. I want to start with trade. We agree with you that we need a trading system subject to certain rules. That is what really matters. Seattle failed because the US, in particular, seemed unable to understand that measures such as environmental protection, the preservation of rural communities through the Common Agricultural Policy, animal welfare, health protection, and social rights represent legitimate concerns. They demonstrated an astonishing degree of lack of instinct with regard to the legitimate concerns of developing countries, and frankly, there is little for developing countries to be grateful to the WTO so far. We expect the European Union to continue the negotiations, maintaining our unwavering position on all these issues. At the same time, our contacts with developing countries must ensure that the next round is a fair one. Could we please have detailed proposals on how this can be achieved within the next three months? Innovation and knowledge—a theme appropriate to the new century. How much innovation has taken place in the Commission and, if I may say so, in Parliament? A few years ago, we had a White Paper on innovation—what has happened since then? One thing I would like to stress here is that we are concerned with follow-up action, not just with an excellent communication, which we welcome, but with follow-up action, follow-up action and more follow-up action!!!	de
I believe it is very serious, at the institutional level, to move toward replacing the collegial decisions required by the Treaty in the European Union with bilateral decisions between governments. I am not discussing the substance of the Austrian issue; I am discussing the serious precedent that could be set if the collegiality imposed by the Treaties is replaced by bilateral decisions: today against one country, tomorrow against another or other countries. That is the first issue. The second issue addresses the problem of the Employment Summit. I was convinced—not least because I attended the debates that led to the inclusion of employment issues on the agendas of the Council and the European Union—that the original intention of the Employment Summit was to combat the problems not of the new knowledge economy, but of the old European economy, the problems of unemployment that exist in factories, shipyards, metallurgy, and steel industries, and that these were the employment issues that were originally presented as the agenda of the Employment Summit. And so, it makes perfect sense to ask the question of whether, when we talk about the problems of the new knowledge economy, the new digital economy—which, as far as I know, has not yet created jobs in Europe—we are not replacing an inability to act on the problems of current unemployment with what is largely, and to this day, rhetoric about the employment problems of the future. No one understands more than all of us the decisive role that the internet, the digital economy, and the knowledge economy play, but those were not the original intentions of the Jobs Summit. The President of the Council concluded on a vaguely ideological note, and thank goodness so. If that is the Social Democratic policy for the economy of the future, I must remind him that one of the most serious problems relating to the internet economy and Europe's backwardness is the lack of entrepreneurial spirit embedded in the education system, in the actions of governments, in the functioning of institutions. And that is what we must fight against to guarantee the knowledge economy of the future. Mr. President of the Council, I would first like to welcome you to the European Parliament, particularly because your appearance symbolizes what the President of the Group of European Socialists has already said here, which is the political symbolism of having also come, in the midst of a tour of the capitals, to hear the European Parliament. This is not the first time, during the Portuguese Presidency, that there has been a different and politically stimulating relationship between the Council and Parliament, but it is, in fact, a significant gesture, as my colleague Barón Crespo has observed, and we are pleased to note it. Our position is clear: we support the Portuguese Government's initiative, because it is a serious initiative and because of its content, both in terms of its strategic objectives and other goals with which we identify.	es
They must also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements being negotiated by the Community. While the communication reveals the Commission's valuable intentions in this sector, it also highlights the absence of certain activities and where improvements in control and management could be made. The communication can be quoted verbatim. Overexploitation is so intense in Community fisheries that scientific authorities have recommended a rapid reduction in exploitation levels by up to 40%. This appeared in the communication of last July. Since then, the Fisheries Council meeting on December 16 decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches of certain species such as cod and anchovy, which in the region amounted to 25% for cod and 43% for anchovy in 2000. Furthermore, the Commission adopted an emergency regulation for the recovery of Irish Sea cod, effectively establishing a halt to cod fishing in the Irish Sea between February 14 and April 13 due to the crisis affecting this species. These are examples of the serious problems facing the fishing sector caused by overexploitation. What can be done to alleviate the damage caused to fishing communities? The first consideration must be the recognition that Community legislation must be strengthened and control procedures improved. Secondly, the principles of Community legislation must be extended to international agreements to which the Community is a party. Thirdly, the European Union must act to improve the monitoring and prevention of existing pollution in Community waters that is harmful to marine life, including fishery resources. More controls must be introduced to prevent oil spills, as in the case of the Erika in the Bay of Biscay, and the intentional dumping of residual fuels. The pressure on the marine system due to the urbanization of coastal areas must also be recognized. This pressure is enormous in the case of Europe. In this context, we can also mention the problem of discarded unwanted catches, fishing gear that destroys the seabed, and the destruction of natural habitats due to over-intensive aquaculture. A quota management system like the one in place in New Zealand since 1986 is a possible alternative. Under this system, and given the total allowable catch, a market is created for individual fishing rights within a given area, which the holders of those rights can trade among themselves, use for fishing, or temporarily lease to other fishers. The property right created in such a system is the right to fish—not the fish itself. Such a market organization can yield better long-term prospects for the fishing industry. Dear colleagues, we currently cannot be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea, nor about the many factors that affect resource reserves in this marine system. However, we must not abandon scientific research, we must never stop gathering information, we must never stop exploring improvements to existing systems, and if necessary, we should at least consider changing policies.	es
As far as social protection is concerned, I can confirm that we have made proposals on qualified majority voting and unanimity voting without any ideological ulterior motive. In your country, Mr Bonde, as everywhere else, importance is attached to the smooth functioning of the internal market, to the fairest possible conditions for competition and the free movement of goods and persons. And this is what we are guided by. We are indeed proposing that certain policies or measures in the field of taxation, social protection, or social security be decided by qualified majority voting if they are directly related to the smooth functioning of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or universal in nature. I am well aware of the sensitivity of these issues of taxation and social protection. In my opinion, there is no need to standardise all national social security systems – that has never been the question – but simply to ensure the best possible conditions for the functioning of the internal market in a Europe of 30 or 27 countries, without any one state being able to block the other 26 or 27. Mr MacCormick, yes, I confirm to you that this dialogue will go well beyond the national capitals; it must reach people where they live, where their roots are. And if I were to say otherwise, I would be contradicting myself as the Commissioner responsible for regional policy, that is, one of the most concrete and visible policies, which serves to support employment and the quality of life of people in their region. I often say that this policy is not only pursued with the primary objective of cohesion and solidarity between regions, but also, as a complement, to ensure that people can preserve their roots, their soul and their identity where they live. We will therefore conduct this dialogue in the cities and regions. Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear, and we are operating within that framework. It stipulates that we should first and foremost address the three fundamental issues that remained unresolved in Amsterdam. To these must be added the related institutional questions, and finally, the questions that the Portuguese and French Presidencies consider still necessary in the course of the negotiations. The Commission will act in accordance with its mandate if it considers it necessary to supplement its position on a wide range of institutional issues on one point or another. I am not yet sure whether this will be the case with Article 7, but if we do so, it will not only be in response to a specific situation, one so serious, however, that the fourteen governments of the Union jointly resolved to react, but we will also consider the future in general. Everything that can be done to definitively safeguard the community of values that we have formed together since the founding fathers established the Union in 1957, and even earlier since the end of the Second World War, is useful. I am sure, Mr Berthu, that we – you and I – can reach agreement at least on this basis.	de
"The answer we received was always the same: ""We cannot free him; he is a war criminal."" Amidst the emotion, the pain, the passion, and the commitments, it was impossible to break the infernal cycle of bloodshed and revenge. If we want to help Cambodians in the task of reconciliation they have begun, it is necessary to try and condemn those responsible at the highest level and exonerate the simple perpetrators and all those who, whether forced or not, were dragged along by them. I hope for the creation of a tribunal, whose impartiality will be guaranteed by the United Nations, the trial and conviction of Ta Mok and his top officials. This will be the only way for Cambodians to forgive those who were mere followers and, thus, achieve lasting peace. Mr. President, this week it has been announced that two prominent Cambodian opposition newspapers have been threatened with closure for having insulted the King and the Prime Minister. These are two newspapers that actively support opposition politician Sam Rengie. Proceedings have been initiated against Sam Rengie to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be prosecuted for treason. The reason for this is that in his speech marking the new millennium, he dared to raise the issue of King Sihanouk's succession, demanding clarification of the procedure to be followed in the event of his death. Last March, a group of men in military uniform murdered one of Sam Rengie's party members in Kandal province. In September, two members of his party were arrested, alleging involvement in a missile attack against the Prime Minister. It should be noted that this is the only party in Cambodia without a military wing. In October, one of the parliamentarians from this same party was kidnapped by men in uniform and released for ransom. The pattern of intimidation is evident. There is more happening in Cambodia. Prisoners are tortured, the army and police are involved in the trafficking of women and children, and pretrial detention is abused. All of this is commonplace. However, the most serious aspect is that the government is resisting prosecution of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal. It is true that the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tensions have eased. Nevertheless, we are seriously concerned about the treatment of the political opposition. If this situation persists, it will inevitably have consequences for relations between the Union and Cambodia. Mr. President, within the framework of international law, a new doctrine is being shaped, according to which no State may treat its citizens or residents in any manner whatsoever, nor is the principle of national sovereignty a pretext to prevent other countries from intervening in cases of serious human rights violations, even when the State's leadership is legitimate or even democratically elected."	es
As for internal reform, you are aware of the commitment my Commission has made to this issue since day one. I am well aware that we will not be able to achieve any political objective unless this deep and comprehensive internal reform is carried out, unless the Commission becomes more effective in all sectors, starting with the one where we are most behind: external aid. Providing rapid aid where it is needed saves lives; providing late aid can sometimes be worse than not providing it at all. When I speak of external aid, I am thinking first of the Balkans, where we are seeing some encouraging signs thanks to the commitment of our officials on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given the organizational problems encountered. I am also thinking of the efforts made by Mr Kouchner, the Stability Pact, which we support energetically and with absolute dedication, but also of new developments, for example in Croatia, where the situation changed in a matter of weeks. The European institutions immediately opened the door to dialogue with this country; they welcomed these changes, knowing full well that the problems of Bosnia, and especially of Serbia, can only be resolved if democracy is established in Serbia. This is the new element that we must help spread throughout the Balkans. We must be more effective in this region; we must restore traffic on the Danube. It is pointless providing aid to Romania and Bulgaria and preventing these two countries from using their main resource. We must decontaminate the river. To this end, the Commissioner for the Environment will present specific plans in the coming days to control this serious problem. We have done a lot in the Balkans: our new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo, the Balkans Task Force, a new regulation to speed up procedures. However, we absolutely must do more. We must liberalize trade in the region, as well as trade between this region and the European Union. We must contribute to the establishment of infrastructural links that break centuries-old isolation. We must intensify efforts to build a democratic and pluralistic society in these countries, equipped with institutions, public structures, police forces, and the organization of civil society. But above all, we must encourage these countries to collaborate in a unified regional perspective, both politically and economically. If we do not do this, we will be failing in our duty. Remember the Marshall Plan; its effectiveness was not the result of its sheer resources alone; it was even more effective because it forced us, Europeans, to collaborate on a new perspective, to give a new horizon to our politics and our economy. This is what we must do for the Balkans. Europe must prove—from the Balkans to the rest of the world—its capacity to expand the area of security, peace, and freedom, its capacity to act on the international stage.	fr
And I would point out, before I move on to my question, that what happens within the framework of the Staff Regulations within the Commission plays a fundamental role in terms of our responsibilities also as employers, because, of course, the staff of the European Parliament work under the same conditions. This will be part of the work that we will have to do, and I am convinced that you will all want to engage in this process today. Well, I would like to follow up on two points with Mr. Kinnock, if you will allow me. The first concerns the timing of these important reforms. Mr. Prodi said in his very important opening speech that he had identified serious problems within the Commission relating to low morale and low motivation, which is clearly a major concern. There are high expectations of these reforms, both within the Commission and outside. And if we want to move forward, I would say that personnel reforms, which are early evidence of a change in culture, that empowerment and motivation of staff must be carried out as soon as possible. And according to the original proposals - and I have the impression that the new ones will not differ in this respect - the general reform of the civil service regulations would not have been completed until 2002. Moreover, some of the fundamental elements would not have been introduced until 2001. I think that is too long a timeframe, and we really need to move much faster than that. The second point I want to raise concerns information technology. Have you really taken into consideration the changes that new information technology will bring to the staff structure, because they will be fundamental to the new direction of these reforms? As for the second part of Mr Harbour's question, he will find that, in the course of this year, we will demonstrate with greater precision how the wider application of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of staff working practices and conditions but also in the functioning of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement. Let me thank Mr Harbour for his energetic commitment to the subject for which he is rapporteur and respond by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, motivation and professional commitment of Commission officials, which are already very high, will be improved by the introduction of comprehensive training, by the allocation of responsibilities, by improved management and by a number of other changes that will be introduced. Cultures are the products of structures and systems, and structures and systems have become old. By renovating them, sometimes in a very radical way, we will help those in the Commission who are resolutely pursuing the European ideal and whose abilities are very high, to express their talents and to make them manifest as they have never done before. I would like to make one final remark in response to Mr Harbour.	fr
Finally, I would like to add that I had my doubts during last week's debate on the formation of a government in Austria. However, I have no reservations about discussing and criticizing Austria's asylum policy. I hope this plenary will be just as committed to this. Mr President, during the last financial perspective for the period 1994-1999, with its total of 13 different initiatives, the cross-border INTERREG II initiative was given great importance. The fact that the INTERREG initiative is included in the next round of Structural Funds for the period 2000-2006 is, in my view, clear evidence of the importance attached to it by the EU Member States. The INTERREG I programme from 1989-1993 and the INTERREG II programme from 1994-1999 have proven to be outstanding successes in terms of convergence in social and economic development between neighboring Member States. In my home region, the border counties in northwest Ireland, I have been able to observe the important role played by INTERREG I and II over the past few years, and I therefore look forward to INTERREG III with great joy. The Commission has allocated 67 million pounds for the INTERREG III programme to continue developing economic projects for communities on both sides of the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The European Union has played a key role in the development of these border regions over the years. With its 80 million pound contribution to the International Fund for Ireland, the EU is the largest single funder, and it also provides 75% of the funding for the Peace and Reconciliation Support Programme. All in all, INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland, and the Peace and Reconciliation Programme have each made a decisive contribution to advancing the peace process. Mr President, I will limit my remarks on INTERREG to a few critical aspects, also in order to keep within the time available to me. We supported the relaunch of this program and the expansion of the areas of intervention, not only in the area of cross-border cooperation, but also in the context of transnational and interregional cooperation. Nevertheless, we are aware that the largest share of resources—between 50 and 80%—will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, that is, for Strand A of the INTERREG III program. Therefore, we continue to believe that the decision to consolidate the current cooperation areas in this Strand is wrong and inconsistent with regard to the selection of eligible regions. We hope and wish that the Commission will address this, that it will accept Parliament's position in substance and not merely give it formal recognition. Cross-border cooperation continues to relate almost exclusively to continental borders, and in cases where exceptions have been made with regard to maritime borders, the relevant decisions are not transparent and often involve balancing other areas of Community policy. The island regions, which live in a regional situation inevitably linked to purely maritime borders, are particularly disadvantaged. This constitutes a continuing discrimination that ignores the content of Article 158 of the Treaty, which mentions islands in the context of policies to strengthen economic and social cohesion.	de
We understand that collaboration and joint work by the two institutions—Parliament and the Commission—are important, and that the collaboration that exists with the Committee on Regional Policy, and specifically with the Transport Group, is magnificent. The common position includes practically all the amendments accepted by the Commission, harmonizes the minimum requirements for the examinations of security advisers, and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one initially proposed by the Commission, given that we have been debating this issue for several years. Very briefly, I would also like to thank the various Members for their interventions and tell the Honourable Members that security is a priority for the Commission in the field of transport. And as Mr. Simpson rightly said, the process can never be taken for granted, assumed, or completed. The process of increasing margins and security guarantees in transport is a process that must be improved day by day. In this regard, I would also like to briefly address the problems of tunnels, mentioned by Mr. Rack and Mr. Swoboda. This is undoubtedly a very sensitive issue in Austria, so efforts must be made to see how to increase safety. In one of the major accidents that occurred recently, the cargo transported was not in itself dangerous. The margarine and a few kilos of paint, which, in principle, posed no risk, caused a real catastrophe. Therefore, we must see how to further refine the requirements to ensure maximum safety. Finally, I would like to say that safety must be considered in all modes of transport. This week we will hold a debate here to discuss the safety of maritime transport, due to the Erika disaster, and we will have to discuss, throughout this year, the safety objectives for air transport. But I would like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that safety is a priority objective of the Commission. As I will say in the debate on the Erika, we do not wait for a catastrophe to focus on the safety aspect; rather, we work on it regardless of those circumstances, which only serve to highlight the urgency of an effective response to these types of problems. I would like to reiterate my thanks to all those who have spoken, and especially to the rapporteur, Mr. Koch. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00. Transport of dangerous goods by road The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)) amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road.	es
I would like to thank Commissioner Patten who, despite the short notice, was willing to participate in today's debate and answer our questions on the extremely critical situation in Mozambique. As other speakers have said, the television images from the Limpopo Valley have left us absolutely breathless: we have seen children who have lost their parents and helpless and hopeless families who have lost everything. As has already been said, this was predictable and had been foreseen, and the fact that the response to the disaster is slow and inadequate - shamefully slow and inadequate - should make us realise that a major investment is needed in preparing a response to such disasters. As the Commissioner has said, we need to put in place a mechanism and a rapid response force that, in situations like this, will enable us to deal with crises that have arisen only because we did not apply the right strategies or did not make the necessary logistical preparations. This morning there were seven helicopters in the air, all concentrated in the Gaza region alone. The Save River is also at high risk of flooding, but no one has been there yet. 85 percent of the relief operations are taking place within an hour's drive from Maputu, so they are not in a position to assess the scale of the problem. I would like to point out to the Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing. Most of us would not want to stop at €3 million; it will take much more, and I hope the Commissioner can come back with a promise of more money and an initiative that can coordinate our efforts. Clearly, a large airlift will have to be set up. As has been said, there is a need for a large amount of food, water purification equipment, tents and blankets. I wonder whether we are ready to take on the next phase of relief and reconstruction that has been talked about, as this phase will also require a lot of resources. Are we ready to provide the necessary financial coverage? Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world, but it is also one of the most successful in Africa. The country has worked hard to promote economic growth, poverty reduction and democracy, despite the enormous pressure of public debt. Mozambique is a model country, but it will most likely face a period of great difficulty because of what it has suffered. We should now try to understand how much the catastrophe will cost Mozambique, and that will depend entirely on the quantity and quality of international aid that is provided. Thank you very much, Mrs Kinnock. Mr Nogueira, we note your interest and concern in this matter, but your group is not registered to speak in the debate and I will abide by the Rules of Procedure. The debate is closed. Economy of the Union (1999) The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document entitled 'The 1999 Economy Review of the European Union' (C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)). The Commission's report presents an assessment of the current European economic situation which it finds promising, particularly in relation to the recent recovery in economic growth which should lead to a reduction in unemployment to 8% by 2001.	it
It's worrying that the bombing has worsened the situation, and it should be acknowledged that NATO and the European Union were wrong to take this measure. The Minister has rightly spoken—I agree—about Belgrade's guilt, but we must also remember that the secret services of the United States, Germany, France, Italy, and Great Britain have been supplying arms and money to the KLA, to a mafia, to contribute to the problems in that area. Therefore, we are all to blame. I wanted to ask you a complementary question, given the global context. Don't you think it would be beneficial to lift the blockade on Serbia to achieve greater economic normality in the area and also benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia? Mr. President, I am no friend of Milosevic or his government, but I have very deep doubts about the legitimacy of NATO's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, both because of the lack of authority of the United Nations Security Council and because I believe that what happened could have been avoided if unacceptable terms for Serbian sovereignty had not been imposed at Rambouillet. The current situation in Kosovo, which has now been ethnically cleansed of Serbs and Roma, corroborates what I have said. I believe that the least NATO should do is acknowledge its guilt for the deliberate attack on the Belgrade television tower, in which more than 20 civilian journalists were killed. This constitutes a grave moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassing possibility that our Western leaders will be accused of war crimes. Your Honor, we do not, at the level of the positions adopted by the European Union, have a selective interpretation and analysis of military objectives, particularly of the initiatives taken against certain types of infrastructure that supported Mr. Milosevic's political and propaganda system. Therefore, I cannot tell you whether or not we agreed with a specific action carried out by NATO. It is part of a global plan on which we agree. Some of these actions could be debatable, and some were considered regrettable even by NATO itself. Others will be justifiable for tactical reasons, in the sense of preventing Mr. Milosevic from continuing his internal propaganda campaign. In any case, I, on behalf of the Council, do not wish to make any value judgments regarding any specific action carried out by NATO in the military sphere. Mr. President-in-Office of the Council, given that I am familiar with the history of the Balkans, I would like to remind you that for many decades the peoples of Yugoslavia lived peacefully. The destabilization began, approximately a decade ago, with the dissolution of Yugoslavia, a process in which the European Union played a decisive role. Yugoslavia's crime was that it was the only Balkan country that had not applied to join either NATO or the European Union. And so, what remained standing after the air raids is now being destroyed by the supposedly disarmed KFOR, right under the noses of KFOR, whose role as an occupying force is becoming increasingly evident.	es
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether this principle is actually applicable and whether we will receive any compensation from the individuals mentioned. The second question relates to the Commission's announced White Paper on environmental liability, which is intended to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in the future and that we have a better opportunity to implement European environmental legislation accordingly. The White Paper acknowledges that the polluter can only be held liable once they have been identified, if the damage is quantifiable, and if a causal link has been proven beyond doubt. The Erika wreck is a prime example; it is precisely what the White Paper is about that happened here. It can therefore become a benchmark for how to deal with problems of this nature in the future. The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage resulting from dangerous activities regulated by the EU. My concern, and perhaps the Commissioner can comment on this, is whether the White Paper on environmental liability is actually the appropriate means to deal with problems of the magnitude of the Erika wreck. Will it truly meet the requirements, or will the perpetrator of shipping accidents on the high seas continue to escape without having to pay for the damage? Mr President, we would like to express our sympathy and solidarity with the people and regions affected by the disaster. Good intentions alone are not enough; compensation must be provided for the damage and the losses must be made good, both in terms of environmental restoration and in terms of shellfish farms and fishing equipment. We welcome the Commissioner's statement that it is necessary to act and compensate swiftly and retroactively. We also criticize the lax inspection of ships and support the creation of a European coastguard and, in particular, the call for stricter legal requirements and for ships with double hulls. We continue to denounce the practice of flags of convenience for both merchant ships and fishing vessels. We are also shocked that the cargo was highly carcinogenic due to the polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of over 1000 ppm. This means that among the 15,000 tons of oil that entered the sea, 15 tons were highly toxic products. This is unacceptable. Moreover, we learned of this too late, so medical check-ups are now necessary, particularly for the volunteers who worked so hard to restore the environment. We believe that special attention must be paid to the prevention of such risks and to scientific research to prevent and repair damage. Numerous proposals have been made that should be examined. Solutions to disasters are not found at the last minute; action must primarily be taken in advance. Mr. President, more than two months after the Erika wreck, the coastal areas that had already been cleaned up are still being polluted. I would like to once again express my solidarity with the victims and pay tribute to the great dedication of the volunteers and professionals who are still working to clean the polluted beaches. As a result of the local mobilisation, which our House championed by holding a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 February, an initial package of measures has been announced.	de
In 80 percent of the market subject to free competition, prices have fallen. This shows that competition really works. My conclusion is: ensure competition in the other 20 percent! In light of these facts, more and more are demanding... (The speaker is interrupted by Markov) I thought I was the one who had the floor. Perhaps we can discuss this a little later. However, I note that it is precisely as I stated, namely, that prices have fallen in sectors where there is competition and have risen where there is a monopoly. This is how it almost always works. I therefore recommend the formation of a committee to take the necessary initiatives and ensure competition in the postal sector. Mr. Markov, you will have a few minutes in five or six minutes. I would appreciate it if you did not interrupt your colleagues. Mr. President, there is a mystery here. What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was adopted on 15 December 1997? The Commission has maintained a deafening silence during the intervening period. I am sorry that it is Commissioner Monti who is here today. I hold him in high esteem. He is one of the most diligent and hardworking Commissioners. I regret that I cannot say the same about some of his colleagues. During this time, there has been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive. Commissioner Monti stated that this is partly due to the organization and redistribution of functions. This was not done until recently. For more than a year, the former Commission could have worked on the issue. The truth is, we have not made much progress. However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to convey a message to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about. It was about gradual liberalization; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector. These issues were fundamental in that report and should remain so in any future directive. The postal service is not just for Christmas. It is for life. In the part of Scotland where I come from, it is much more than just a postal service. It is a means of keeping communities together. The postal service is also the bus service. The postal service is also the social service. The postal service is also the medical service. If we allow postal services to drift towards complete privatization, then we will lose all of that, and many of our local communities—we voted on tourism earlier—will lose their tourism activity. We will isolate them. Postal services are important. This message must go out from here today. And the Commission must listen to it. Mr. President, we support the liberalization of postal services in the Union. This means, above all, that customers will have a better service. This is what is intended, and this must be the ultimate goal.	es
The Financial Regulation is the legal framework for implementing the priorities set out in accession cooperation with Malta and Cyprus. I cannot begin until we have it, as I lack the legal basis. If the alleged lack of coherence has anything to do with this point, I must say that this regulation is merely a legal framework and nothing more. Compliance with this legal framework can be found in the accession cooperation priorities agreed upon last year by the Commission and the Council, which are now being implemented in the corresponding programming and project management. I would say that there are many areas in European policy where one can complain of a lack of coherence, but in this case, I commend the Commission and the Council for developing a very clear and coherent policy. (DE) Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, after the Commissioner has explained to us in an extraordinarily coherent manner that the lack of consistency was due to the responsibilities of the former President of the Council and his Minister for Europe, could you perhaps help us and the Commissioner so that this resolution can be adopted? A very helpful solution would be if you could respond positively to my questions on the financial projections up to 2004 and on Category 7, or at least if you could say that the Portuguese Presidency of the Council intends to compensate for the lack of consistency at that time by making an effort such as the one described, just as the Commissioner will also try to achieve in the Commission. Mr. President, I believe that the question raised by the honourable Member and my friend Elmar Brok will be examined by the Council. I believe that the criticism made of the previous Presidency is irrelevant. I consider that what the previous Presidency did in formulating the financial perspectives was excellent work, regardless of who was involved in it. In any case, the issue you raise is important, and we, at the Council level, will not fail to support the Commission's proposals in this regard. Mr. President of the Council, I understand; Mr. Brok was referring to an even longer Presidency. Mr. President, I asked Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the Meda financing instrument, to which he has not responded. I ask you to do so, as your response also determines the voting behavior on various amendments submitted to us. Dear Mr. Poos, I beg your pardon. Precisely where you posed the question, there was an unclear aspect. In the case of Meda, the situation is such that Malta and Cyprus can participate in the supraregional programs, but not in the country-specific programs because the revenues are too high. Thank you very much, Commissioner Verheugen. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday.	es
It should also be noted that, once again, the Commission is effectively avoiding the issue of concrete action in the area of equal opportunities. In conclusion, we are faced with a document that is not particularly satisfactory and, in some respects, disappointing. Berend report (A5-0107/1999) We agree, in essence, with the rapporteur's assessment and considerations regarding the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union. We will therefore confine ourselves to highlighting certain aspects only. Firstly, as the Commission itself says, the fact that the GDP per capita of some of the poorest regions increased significantly between 1991 and 1996 is due to a large extent to the inclusion of the new German Länder in the calculations of the Community average, starting precisely from the first year. This fact is obviously the cause of a significant reduction in the level of GDP per capita in the Union. Secondly, it is particularly important for us to note that the recovery of some regions - where it has taken place - has been accompanied by a minimal increase in employment, which therefore requires new development strategies, with major concern for this area. This situation contradicts the slow adoption of employment promotion measures reserved exclusively for the internal policy of the Member States, as the report does. Last but not least, we would mention the rapporteur's proposal to include in future in this type of report, among other aspects, an analysis of the interregional evolution of cohesion in each State. The multiplicity of situations and the differentiated evolution from one region to another, within the same State, in fact require a thorough evaluation of this issue in order to allow and guarantee the correction of regional (and other) policies in order to ensure cohesion also at the internal level of each Member State. Given the employment situation in the Community and the European Union's stated ambition to tackle unemployment resolutely, the Commission's analysis of mergers should take into account factors other than competition. I take as an example the restructuring of the ABB-Alsthom Power company, for which a large delegation of employees from across Europe is present in Strasbourg today. The management of ABB-Alsthom Power, which resulted from a merger carried out in June 1999, announced a restructuring with the prospect of job cuts already in a number of countries. This situation, which is detrimental to employment, raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, which has existed since 1996. This implies updating and strengthening the Community directive on European Works Councils. It also implies merger control that takes employment, the environment, and consumers into consideration. Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is insufficient from this point of view, I abstained. By claiming to apply the principle of subsidiarity at the level of European competition policy, the Commission is decentralising responsibility for decisions and abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements that create distortions in the market to national authorities and courts, although issues of concentration of companies and state aid remain within the notification regime.	fr
The European Union and its Member States must set an example and contribute a significant portion of these funds. By doing so, we would not only embarrass the United States in terms of fulfilling its financial responsibilities regarding the financing of the United Nations, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than just rhetoric. Mr. President, this debate aims to prepare for the next annual session of the United Nations on human rights and the actions of the Commission and the Council therein. First of all, let me say that I am very pleased with what Mr. Patten and the Minister have said so far, and I think it is right that both China and Cuba are being discussed. Cuba remains the last dictatorship in South America, and we cannot forget that, despite all the sympathy Cuba arouses in some circles. It is a dictatorship and, therefore, not a democracy. I would like to draw attention during my two minutes to two countries with which I have a special bond. First, Indonesia. Of course, we are very pleased that Indonesia has a new government and that Mr. Wahid and Mrs. Sukarnoputri are serving as president and vice-president, respectively. We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is gradually moving in the right direction. However, I inform you that the violence is not yet under control in the Moluccas, a territory located north of Timor. Thousands have died in the last two years. Tens of thousands of people have fled. The situation is not well controlled. I know that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow there will be an important program on Dutch television urging the dispatch of observers, simply to examine precisely what is happening there, so that, in any case, what is happening is recorded, also with a view to the human rights commissions later on. My urgent request is, and this is something we have included in resolutions on various occasions, that we negotiate the dispatch of observers to the Moluccas. The thousands of dead, thousands of wounded, tens of thousands of refugees are enough. My second country—and I want to be very brief, since Mr. Patten knows it very well—is Burma. It is unacceptable that we do not speak out about this country. I have the impression that Burma has been gradually forgotten. The elected president has been under house arrest for ten years now. Parliament has not functioned for ten years now. Countless parliamentarians have been killed or fled, and only a handful still live in Burma. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have left Burma for Thailand or India, yet it seems that no attention is being paid to that country anymore. I think this country should be put back on the agenda, especially given the change that has taken place in Indonesia.	es
"It is a fact that a new agreement has been concluded with the ACP countries. In itself, this is a positive development, particularly considering the pressures aimed at terminating it and the fact that several Member States were even opposed to continuing it. In due course, we will have the opportunity to analyze more deeply the exact terms under which this agreement was established. However, there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and fell short of the proposals we made at the time, even though the new agreement contains new and innovative elements. And some politically important features of the new association agreement will have contributed to this. This was undoubtedly the result of a complex negotiation in which both parties made substantial concessions, as is true in the case of the European Union, particularly in the areas of good administration and trade. But it was above all the result of a strengthening of the ACP group, which clearly found a new spirit in the wake of what happened in Seattle. I would like to emphasize in particular that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging, particularly in the area of trade, so a new approach in this regard is very necessary. Finally, it is necessary to go further in policies to support the development of developing countries. At the financial and budgetary levels, in the level of debt, in support for sensitive areas such as food and humanitarian security, education and health, and also in the environmental, investment, or access to information and new technologies, as well as in the area of trade, while ensuring full coherence of development policies with other Community policies and also between them and the corresponding policies implemented by the Member States. We cannot be content with essentially continuing something that has proved insufficient and flawed in the past. Mr. President, after listening to the Commission and the Council today, I simply had to take a look at my agenda. Yes, it does indeed appear there: ""Coherence of the various Union policies with development policy."" However, we have not heard a single word about it, and I find it extremely shameful. We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years. It should have been presented in writing here today, and having heard Mr. Nielson's speech, I can easily imagine that he has encountered very powerful opposing forces within the Commission. I know that the Commissioner himself holds views that are both solid and extremely sensible regarding coherence, and I would have liked to hear them here today. Since the joint motion for a resolution sets out some effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence, I would like to limit myself, in the very short time I have, to mentioning another: the obligation for the Commission to also carry out an assessment of relevant new legislation in this regard. And, incidentally, I would also like to focus on the catastrophic effect that the EU's common agricultural policy has had on developing countries. Dumping beef into the sea in the Sahel and South Africa, tomato paste in West Africa, powdered milk in Jamaica—hopefully, all these examples are well known."	es
How do we implement what is laid down in relatively great detail in the treaties regarding development aid programs? Several Members, Mr. Ferber and Mr. Cushnahan, spoke about the gap between Sunday speeches and reality. Mr. Cashman pointed out that words cannot replace actions, which is quite true in a way. Of course, words can achieve something, as Mrs. Malmström said. She explained that she had received a letter from the Chinese ambassador, an extremely amiable and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country, in which he told her that she was mistaken and that the European Parliament was wrong in its stance on the issue of human rights in China. I expect that Mrs. Malmström will receive a flood of letters from the Chinese authorities after her speech today. She will then be able to fill an entire filing cabinet with letters about the supposedly real situation in China. She has expressed the viewpoint of many non-governmental organizations, as well as many people who admire Chinese civilization but are concerned about current events in China. It is entirely right to consider what we can do. In his first speech, Mr Salafranca mentioned two areas in which action is being taken, apart from the Geneva meeting. One of these measures has been made possible by the generosity of the European Parliament, on behalf of European taxpayers: the budget available to us for strengthening human rights, which includes some EUR 100 million for the programs for which I am responsible. Most of this money will be allocated to non-governmental organizations, where it will be used to promote human rights and the democratization process. We will discuss with Parliament how best to design and direct these expenditure-intensive programs to promote human rights in the coming years. There is also the issue raised by Mr Salafranca, who, unfortunately, cannot be here at the end of this short but useful debate. It also concerns our human rights policy in general and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy. I would like to remind Parliament that by the middle of the year the Commission will have presented a comprehensive and theoretically sound explanation of why human rights should be placed at the heart of development policy and the Common Foreign and Security Policy. This is of the utmost importance, and if I had not already been convinced of it, I would certainly have come to this conclusion after today's remarkable speech by Mr Havel. This debate has been very useful. I hope there will be more debates like this one. I would welcome, in particular, a discussion about how we can put these good intentions into practice where it matters, where people are still being tortured and raped, and where people are still being denied their civil rights, which this House, like me, takes for granted. I have received seven motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 37(2), to conclude this statement. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday. Cyprus and Malta. The next item is the joint debate on:	de
"The issue is very important and I would like to know, given that we could talk about a ""baby scam"", whether the Commissioner will ensure that those funds are not taken away from the Andalusians, so that the funding that the European Union allocates to Andalusia, based on the census criterion, takes into account those 400,000 children that Aznar does not take into account when it comes to providing them with schools and services. Honourable Member, I ask everyone, do not take this as a call to order, to deal with purely community issues. I realise that for Spain these are very important issues on which opinions differ... I would like to point out to the Commissioner that Aznar is the Prime Minister of the Spanish Government. Please, can you answer the question. Honourable Member, given that I have heard that you have a voice, I hope that your voice is strong enough to be heard in Madrid. In any case, I understand that your comments were not addressed to me directly. I have answered you. I am concerned that the Structural Funds, particularly those under Objective 1, are allocated where they are needed. We have criteria to apply and we know approximately how much each region of Europe should or could receive. This does not mean that I do not hide behind it, but I am always required to refer to the general regulation, that I must discuss with the national authorities of each country and with the government of each country. It is up to them to proceed with the most objective and fair distribution possible. I still need to know, which is why I told you that I am not in a position to answer today. Since I do not have the answer, I wrote to the Ministry of Economy and Finance on 14 December. I am now impatient for the answer and when I do, I will send it to you. I regret that the Commissioner has once again been involved in an imaginative, and in this case impassioned, intervention. I want to remind everyone that in Spain we are not in an election period, we are only 25 days away from the elections. It is a consolation for the Commissioner that the call to the polls will be held in 25 days, because after that he will probably no longer have to hear this type of question. I think it is important to state that Andalusia, within the Community, will receive 50% more and that Spain has a record in the implementation of the Structural Funds, which means that the distribution is strictly based on the implementing regulations and is decentralised through the regional development plans and the various Community support frameworks. Finally, I would like to ask you a specific question, Commissioner: do you think it is necessary to amend the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria acceptable? I find this debate fascinating. I realise that it has a dimension that is not exclusively Community-wide. Having said that, we must accept the idea that elections are continually being held in all the countries of the Union. I am pleased that the Structural Funds in Greece and Spain are finally being discussed. Just a moment ago, in this Chamber, we were talking about civic debates, about public debates."	it
We find ourselves in a historic situation in which negotiations are being conducted or are about to begin with 12 states, and now we are together in a situation in which the unification of Europe can become a reality within a foreseeable period of time. But how is the Union to be enlarged if we do not get down to business now – that is, before enlargement actually takes place? That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference. We consider it indispensable and urgent and hope that it will indeed produce the results that will make an early enlargement of the European Union possible. My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, has noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is not satisfied with the current situation. You can therefore be assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will also work to ensure that the Union finally does its homework. It is about nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and above all, it is about a Europe that citizens truly see as their own, because they can help shape it and because the worries and needs, the problems and questions that concern them every day, are taken seriously by politicians. Closed-door policies, secretive discussions – all of this must be a thing of the past once and for all. That is why transparency is necessary. I believe that you, as the Council Presidency, should ensure that the train does not continue to roll along as before and that people are not left on the platforms like treaty illiterates. We consider it essential not only that everything is done to comprehensively inform citizens about the course and results of the Intergovernmental Conference, but that they must also be directly involved in the entire reform process. We also believe that political decision-makers must finally overcome their fears and, after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, ask citizens in referendums whether they agree with how their Europe will develop in the future. In this way, we would truly have a Europe of citizens, and we would truly have a completely new quality of democratic legitimacy for the Union. I want to clearly address another central democratic issue. As a member of the Convention, which has now begun its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I want to make it clear: For me and my group, a solemn proclamation of the Charter is not enough. What will citizens say if their rights are solemnly proclaimed to them, but they cannot enforce them individually? No, I think that would only further deepen the Union's credibility crisis. The low turnout in the European elections should really be alarm signal enough for everyone. What we need are rights visible to everyone; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must become legally binding for all people living in the Union, for all its citizens. We should work together toward this goal in the interest of the citizens, and I expect the Intergovernmental Conference to revise the Cologne decision on this matter at the end of the year. Of course, it is also about the efficiency of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 or more Member States.	de
How do you now intend to operate also according to psychological criteria in this crisis region, ensuring the best possible support? Honourable Member, as I have already said, I understand your concerns. I think that at the moment and, in particular, in recent months, there have been some positive developments regarding the means that Mr Kouchner will be able to use for effective action. I remember that I heard Mr Kouchner on this matter during the ministerial meeting of the Council of Europe and I believe that many of the concerns he expressed then, about the lack of means to be able to overcome certain problems, have now been resolved, or that such means have been provided to him. In particular, two are essential: firstly, a strengthening of the police - an important element for the protection of civilian populations, especially for the protection of certain civilian populations - and, secondly, an increase in appropriations that specifically allows the maintenance of certain officials with important tasks in the administrative process, if we want to call it that, and functional within Kosovo. The question we all need to ask ourselves, honourable Member - and this is what we did a short while ago in a diplomatic way - concerns the very coherence of Security Council Resolution 1244/99. I know that this is an extremely sensitive issue, but we all need to question the logic behind this resolution and whether it can be implemented. We support the need for its full and total implementation: however, we need to examine this resolution - and this is probably something that the United Nations Security Council will have to do sooner or later - in the sense of verifying, as has happened in the past in other areas and in other strategic scenarios at global level, whether certain types of procedures, logic and balances - the same ones, among other things, that led to the resolution being approved - should or should not be maintained in the future. What we need to do and what we, as the European Union, are doing, is to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary means. You are right, Mr President, we have a duty to our citizens to report regularly and openly on whether these means are being used well or not. As a Council, we intend to provide information on this during the Portuguese Presidency. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I completely agree with you. The problem is not Kouchner, but the legal basis on which he works, namely Resolution 1244. Having said that, I think that the Union's responsibility, that is to say yours, but also ours, is to begin to make an effort to overcome this provisional nature of the resolution and to imagine a future scenario for the whole region. I think that it is the lack of definition of this scenario that causes or encourages the excesses, the incidents, the murders that Mr Alavanos spoke about. Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo? If so, do you intend to do so within the framework of a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as much as possible the multiplication of micro-states, as some tend to do, and reunifying the parts, in this case Kosovo and Albania?	it
To give one example, in Ireland we have seen the success of the LEADER I and LEADER II programmes in the sense of jobs being created through the administration of these programmes in rural areas of Ireland and Europe. LEADER III is due to be implemented towards the end of this year. The LEADER programme essentially offers the public sector, the private sector and voluntary groups the opportunity to pool their collective talents to create sustainable, long-term jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas. This is a classic illustration of how the concept of partnership works and how these programmes should be applied with the broadest possible mandate. The European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has also been successful in creating jobs in the Irish Border Counties. Once again it is the active participation of public and private actors and the voluntary sector that demonstrates how these funds can best be used to support the different local job creation projects in the region. During the next round of the Structural Funds for 2000-2006, other Community initiatives such as EQUAL and URBAN will operate. These initiatives must also involve local authorities and communities in the effort to identify the optimal use of the European Structural Funds. The rapporteur mentions the need to follow an integrated approach for the new Structural Fund plans and programmes which must promote a decentralised, efficient and composite partnership, based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities. This is a very delicate issue because the main economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome without a crucial integration between national, local and European funds. This report brings us back to the question of why we have a regional policy. To bridge regional gaps, of course. But, above all, because although the European market guarantees us a priori a better functioning of the economy, it can also be a source of inequalities. Jacques Delors used to say that since the market is short-sighted, there is a political need to reduce disparities. This is the phenomenon of solidarity that is at the origin of the European social model that we all defend, from which economic and social cohesion is born. A true political objective, just like the economy and the monetary system, it is implemented in collaboration with the Member States, the regions and local authorities. The Commission, for its part, is responsible for indicating to the Member States, through guidelines, the direction to follow to achieve the desired objectives in the context of programming. For this reason, I will support this report, while regretting, for reasons of time, that the European Parliament was consulted only late on guidelines which should have helped the Member States, regions and local authorities in the programming of Objectives 1, 2 and 3. On the other hand, I hope that our Assembly will also take into account the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which contributes a series of reflections on essential issues such as the fight against social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of an employment strategy.	it
The European Union has a specific role to play in this area of responsibility, but we cannot claim to be able to quickly restore structures which, as the Honourable Member rightly pointed out, were not the best even before the military action in Kosovo. Furthermore, it does not seem to me, Honourable Member, that the military actions in Kosovo contributed to such massive destruction of the health care structures that they had a direct impact on the current situation. What we are currently experiencing is essentially due to the dramatic situation of the displaced populations, to a number of economic factors, and to the level at which basic health care needs are met as a result of the general deregulation of the administrative structure in Kosovo. This central question lies at the heart of the entire current situation. If we do not resolve the political problem, which must be done within the framework of the relevant United Nations resolution, then there will be no solution to the problem of children's health, nor to other areas of development in this region. I would, however, like to broaden the debate to include the situation in Mitrovica. The international community, with European assistance, has rebuilt the hospital there. However, it is located in the northern part of the city, making access extremely difficult for Kosovo Albanians. This means that Kosovo Albanians are excluded from any medical care. Since this is also the case in other parts of the country, tensions arise between Kosovo Albanians and Serbs; no one trusts anyone anymore, and Albanians don't want to be cared for by Serbs, and vice versa. I understand your point—and rightly so—that the European Union must work within a larger international organization. But where will you place your emphasis? What will you do to ensure that Kosovo Albanians can also be treated in a hospital, including the one in Mitrovica? Mr. Member of Parliament, the Mitrovica problem is well known. It is a very specific situation with high levels of interethnic tension, which fortunately does not reach the same level of danger in other parts of Kosovo. I fully understand the Member of Parliament's concern. I would like to say to him, however, that in his approach to this matter, Bernard Kouchner has followed a line of preserving what underlies the United Nations resolution in question, namely, trying to create the conditions for multi-ethnic structures that can serve the individual communities, including the various administrative levels. I believe that we should not make hasty judgments about responsibilities on this issue, because several key players are involved. The situation in Mitrovica is deplorable; it is characterized by specific tensions, and I believe that positive security measures have been taken in the area in recent hours. I would like to say, however, that, regrettably, we do not have the police capacity—this is due to the contributions of the Member States—to guarantee what we set out to do in the follow-up to the military action, namely, to set up sufficiently secure inter-ethnic cooperation mechanisms, particularly regarding access to hospital facilities.	de
However, one gets the impression that this growth, which is due first and foremost to the efficiency of the United States, then to the productivity gains of the new economy and the new information and communication technologies, is being driven by the general trend of the world, even despite our handicaps. We are well aware of these handicaps, which urgently need to be remedied: structural rigidity as well as excessive taxation. But let us not forget that the single currency has brought with it a new handicap. The single monetary policy and the gradual adjustment of other policy areas are creating additional rigidity for the eurozone countries by imposing on them behaviors that are not necessarily consistent with their respective structures and economic conditions. This unification is viewed as positive in the Commission's report. In reality, however, it cannot be ruled out that it is leading to a global situation that is far from optimal. If we also take into account the strangeness of a single currency that is not based on a state, which in turn is based on a people, it is easy to explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels: the markets' distrust of the euro. Certainly, the weakness of the single currency at the beginning of 1999 had its advantages, as it promoted growth in unexpected ways, but in the long run it cannot be concealed that it is in fact the symptom of bad policies and poor operating conditions. Mr President, this draft resolution is controversial. This is hardly surprising given its subject. Economists do not always agree, especially when it comes to the future. The rapporteur's carefree plea for higher economic growth seems like an attractive method of combating high unemployment. In reality, however, this is a short-term policy. Even if the rapporteur advocates sustainable growth, this has nothing to do with sustainability. In light of ecological and demographic developments, we should encourage member states to pursue selective economic growth. Increased investment, production, and consumption only bring short-term prosperity. The consumption of scarce raw materials and energy must be significantly reduced. Other priorities include the repayment of high government debt and the restructuring of pension systems. If member states do not take action in this regard, even fewer resources will be available for healthcare, education, and other important public institutions. A plea for more active government policy makes a rather strange impression. This ignores the recent Eurostat reports on rising inflation, which is now at 2%, the maximum permissible level. Those who nevertheless want higher government spending, should it be implemented, need not wait long for the next interest rate hike by the European Central Bank. Any job creation the government might then achieve will be wiped out by the unfavorable developments, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. The high unemployment rate in the European Union is a concern for all of us, especially since the downward trend does not appear to be continuing. However, promoting employment requires a long-term perspective, a structural policy. It is primarily the responsibility of the Member States to pursue sound policies. To do so, however, they must be given sufficient leeway. Rigidity through the imposition of social convergence criteria and other Community directives certainly does not contribute to the desired employment growth.	de
And, since today is Valentine's Day, as a former mayor of a regional town, I propose that we declare our love for the European regions that need it. Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, rural development must and can take into account three issues: maintaining employment, protecting the countryside, and above all, local culture, because it is important. The quality of life in rural areas can only be preserved in the long term if the rural population remains there. One only has to look at what is happening in certain Alpine regions to realize how catastrophic the consequences of rural exodus are. I would, however, warn you against the risk of transferring urban culture to rural areas through these programs. We should also avoid creating subsidized structures that are eternally dependent on these subsidies. To ensure this sustainability - a term that, incidentally, has become rather hollow, but we all understand what it implies - it is particularly important to establish links in the countryside between, for example, tourism and agriculture. Investments must now have a visionary orientation. It is therefore imperative to involve the young and creative minds of our countryside, because if they desert the countryside, nothing much will happen. We are not all very keen on sprinkling things in, nor are we all keen on pilot projects that are supposed to have a snowball effect, so to speak, and generate other similar projects. I am rather in favour of closed circuits. And even though Leader I and Leader II may have had certain shortcomings here and there, these two initiatives have certainly proven to be positive overall. I call on my colleagues to reflect and ask them to be careful not to make an exception just for the Nordic countries, but also to include the mountainous regions, namely the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Sierra Nevada, where I come from, especially with regard to population size and density. Mr President, I would like to talk about the EQUAL report, and in particular refugee policy. Last week we had a very lively discussion about the formation of the Austrian government. Today we are already discussing the refugee policy that the Austrian government coalition intends to pursue, since Mrs Stenzel, who drafted the EQUAL report, represents the conservative party in power in Austria and its policy. The most striking point in her first report was the desire to limit aid to refugees to the small group of people covered by the Geneva Convention, in other words, those known as quota refugees, or UN refugees. In fact, it is the other refugees, those excluded from the UN quota and support, who need help the most. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that the EQUAL programme should apply to all refugees, on equal terms. However, part of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs defended Mrs Stenzel's proposal and formulations. This means, in my view, that Haider's policy is already casting its shadow over this Parliament.	fr
This item has been postponed to the next March part-session. It is still listed on today's agenda by mistake. Mr. Swoboda, I confirm what you have just said. It is indeed a misprint. The agenda that was distributed is not authoritative because the decision was taken to postpone the discussion on this item. Mr. President, I would like to point out that this morning, on my way to the plenary, I noticed two people smoking outside the Chamber. The smell is truly disgusting! Please do something about it! I don't think I can do it, but I agree with you that a way must be found as soon as possible to educate even those who do not comply with the bans we ourselves have imposed. As for the flight delays and the resulting problems, those who have had difficulty getting to this part-session in Strasbourg could join forces—honestly, I don't know how many there are—to make a stand. then we could examine which problems have actually arisen and to what extent. Coherence of the various Union policies with development policy The next item on the agenda are the statements by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of the various Union policies with development policy. Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to address this Parliament for the first time on behalf of the Presidency of the Council, in recognition of the extremely important role that the European Parliament will undoubtedly have to play in the coming period in further shaping development policy at European Union level, for I have the honour of presenting to you today a statement on the coherence of European Union development policy. I should, of course, like to leave it to the Commission to add some of the comments that I shall have the opportunity to make. First of all, I would like to stress that, at the level of the European Union, we all feel it necessary to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that have taken place in many aspects of life, particularly through technological advances that have accelerated in recent decades and have contributed to the well-being and improvement of the living conditions of broad sections of the world's population, with the fact that, at the same time, the disproportions between certain regions and geopolitical areas of the globe have become even more pronounced. This calls into question the stability of the international system and threatens peace, giving rise to a moral obligation for all of us to tailor our policies, as best as possible, to ensure greater stability and balance in the various areas that make up our planet. This calls for a reassessment of development policy as a response to the globalization of economic and financial markets. As has been seen, the conditions under which these markets operate are severely distorted, which naturally requires significant adjustments, which in turn—also inevitably—imply new options for development policy. Consequently, we are on the threshold of a new paradigm for development policy, and to achieve this, I would like to stress, it is necessary that our action focuses on four essential aspects:	de
"But who defines this mission? Who draws the line beyond which this public service mission is committed? Our answer is clear: it is not the Commission, it is not even the Council or the European Parliament, it is the people of each Member State, through a democratic debate. To wish to proceed differently would distort the spirit of our institutions. Mr. President, we are in the first phase of adapting Directive 97/67/EC on postal services, and I fear that a new stage of liberalization will result in a significant reduction in public service provision. During Mr. Bolkestein's hearing, my colleague Véronique Mathieu had stated that ""any new proposal, once known, should be subject to impact studies, so that the consequences of the programming of this liberalization are known before the provisions are adopted."" Where are we today? Do we have the outcome of this impact study? As you know, we, members of the EDD Group, along with other members, defend rural life, the preservation of employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion that must be strengthened by a quality universal public service. I would like to be able to say, of course, that the examples I have witnessed daily in my country, in my deeply rural region, allow us to embark without fear on a new phase of liberalization. Unfortunately, that is not the case. And currently, by combining the beginning of the entry into force of the European directive with the 35-hour law, which is very French, but also by modifying the working time criteria—for example, 1,700 objects/hour that must be managed per workstation, compared to the previous 1,400—we can see in our rural areas either a reduction in opening hours or the possible closure of some post offices. This is an intolerable setback for public service. I have here the municipal newspaper of my town, where I can read: ""The Postmaster informs the population that, as of January 3, 2000—which is very recent—the last collection will be made at 3:45 p.m. instead of the usual 4:30 p.m. until then."" You can understand, then, why I fear a broader phase of liberalization and its package of measures, which will bring about a new wave of desertification. As you know, in our country, every town has its own post office, or at least its mailbox, where the mail is collected daily. The postman is not simply a distributor of mail; he is also the only social link with the inhabitants. He also delivers money and sometimes even medicines, thus making it possible for elderly and geographically isolated people to continue living in their town. With a poorly controlled liberalization of postal services, more post offices will be closed, invoking that all-too-famous profitability that is often the cause of rural decline."	es
I can say that the Commission's report on this matter of State aid to the steel industry, as you know, does not cover individual decisions taken under the exceptional procedure provided for in Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, as these decisions fall outside the scope of the Steel Aid Code. With regard to the future provisions on aid to the steel industry, which will come into force in July 2002, we will take measures to ensure that rigorous regulations continue to be applied, the need for which is shared by the industrial sectors themselves. Once we have finalized our proposal for the new rules and chosen the most appropriate legal form, I will be happy to present our views to you. Mr. President, what I take away from this debate, for which I am extremely grateful to Parliament, is the European Parliament's intellectual and political support—I believe without distinction—for competition policy, substantial recognition of the work the Commission is doing, and confidence that it can continue to do so in the future, things for which I am especially grateful. We will continue, especially with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but more generally with Parliament, this interinstitutional dialogue that has been established. In this regard, Mrs. Palacio, I appreciated your words: we must all row, and if possible, in the same direction. Competition is not an objective, as Mr. Rapkay rightly observed, but an extraordinarily important instrument in our European construction. As Mr. von Wogau said at the beginning of the debate, competition, ultimately, is not something abstract: it is in the interest of citizens; it is the basis of the social market economy. And I would like to add that competition has had and will continue to have a civic, and not just economic, value in European construction. Thank you very much, Commissioner Monti. The joint debate is closed. The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12:00. Criminal protection of the Union's financial interests The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs. Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, which contains Parliament's recommendations to the Commission on the establishment of criminal protection of the Union's financial interests. Mr. President, year after year we hear, particularly through the Court of Auditors' audit reports, of the loss of funds from the European Union budget due to waste, mismanagement, irregularities, and even outright alleged fraud. These anomalies led Parliament some time ago to consider proposing, on its own initiative, measures aimed at protecting European taxpayers' money, which ultimately funds the Union's budget. In this context, the fight against fraud, its investigation, punishment, and deterrence deserve special attention. The establishment of UCLAF from the Task Force and the subsequent creation of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) were important steps, as was the Regulation governing the protection of the Community's financial interests and on-the-spot checks.	es
The Chinese leaders have no doubts about our position on all these issues and on the evolution of the situation in Tibet. We have made our views very clear. While we all know that for many people in China there has been a real long-term improvement in financial prospects and social and economic freedoms, there is also a dark side to this picture. Those who criticise the proposal to table a resolution argue that at least now there is a dialogue with China on human rights. This is true and potentially useful, although I have to say - and I have told Chinese officials as has the Presidency - that the content of our dialogue has not come close to what we would have liked. As is well known, the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the legal field and in the sphere of human rights. We are very pleased with this outcome and I believe that our village governance programme should also help to promote democracy at the grassroots level. It is clear that any complex dialogue like the one on human rights will be a long-term process, but I would like to be able to aim for more concrete results. The next dialogue in Lisbon, on 25 February, will be an important test. It will show whether the dialogue produces results or not. Finally, what are the first steps we would like to implement? For example, we would like to see China move from signing the UN Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights to actually ratifying them. I would like us to be closer to that step. In the light of all this, what should our attitude be this year? I repeat that the Member States will have to take a decision. I hope, first of all, that Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it, without suppressing anything from it, that this position will not be based on illusions or pretensions and that it will be a common and reasonable position. I know that some people say that we should find a more effective way of lobbying for human rights than by tabling resolutions. If that is true, then we must at least make an effort of imagination and be more honest with ourselves in seeking that way of moving forward. If we want to base our position on human rights dialogue, then we need to be able to convince you, the NGO community and the general public that we are actually making progress. That, in my view, is the challenge for the coming weeks. I am grateful to the House for the concerns it has expressed about human rights in the world and in China in particular. Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten. I adjourn the debate on the joint statement on the next UN Human Rights session for the vote. Welcome I warmly welcome to the Chamber the delegation from the Hong Kong Legislative Council. (Loud applause) VOTES Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following this vote I would like to ask the responsible Commissioner Byrne whether he is now prepared, having seen the high degree of consensus in Parliament, to accept the amendments.	it
"It would be a great victory if we could export this model with the Macedonians to the rest of the Western Balkans. This exemplary model also applies to regional cooperation. I fully agree with the rapporteur that a balance must be struck, that we must encourage regional cooperation on the one hand and openness towards Bulgaria and Greece on the other, and not isolate the latter. Mr President, Commissioner, if we complete this first step successfully, we will have already come a long way. If we rush it, we will have lost even more. Mr President, let me first of all make it clear that I have no problem supporting this very well-founded report in principle. I simply want to highlight an issue that I believe is missing from the report and which presents a major problem for the Macedonians and for the effectiveness of EU aid, financial or otherwise. I want to talk about the sanctions against Yugoslavia. Just so that there is no misunderstanding, I also believe it is imperative that we effectively oppose the Milosevic regime. However, first of all, these sanctions also affect many neighboring states, including Macedonia, in a comprehensive and negative way, even though they are already in a very difficult economic situation. Secondly, this politically counterproductive strategy, which contravenes essential humanitarian principles, has the effect of making the Yugoslav population dependent on Milosevic and his entourage. I therefore believe that the issue being debated today should lead us to demand a rapid end to the sanctions policy, as provided for in Amendment 10. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we did not have to wait for the end of the Kosovo conflict to arrive at the conclusion that, after several wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their attendant harmful effects on the stability of the Balkan region, it is necessary to implement a comprehensive and lasting strategy guaranteeing peace and stability in South-Eastern Europe. This strategy, which took the form of the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999, considers the South-Eastern European region as an entity, but at the same time recognises the diversity and unevenness of the development of the different countries that make it up. The European Union's contribution within the framework of the Stability Pact, translated into the so-called ""Stabilization and Association Process"", relates to the development of the regional concept that the EC drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region, namely Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania, the most significant aspect of which is the establishment of political and economic measures to support the Dayton Peace Agreements, which should thus contribute to the stability of the region. Therefore, the establishment of completely new bases for relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the opening of this country to the prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through a mechanism provided for in the Stabilization and Association Process, constitute an important contribution to the stability of the Balkan region."	fr
"We must do everything in our power to support East Timor in achieving this goal. Human rights are such a high priority within the ACP-EU Joint Assembly that Joint Vice-Presidents have been appointed specifically to closely monitor human rights issues and report to the Assembly. A number of cases have been raised, including the use of child soldiers in Sudan, where many children have been trafficked from neighboring countries. I was elected European Co-President at the beginning of the fifth parliamentary term, and Mr. Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President. I advocate for a number of changes in our Assembly, which will be particularly necessary after the signing of the new agreement in May. We need a greater degree of equality between our ACP partners and our European members, and the ""us versus them"" syndrome must be overcome. First, I advocate for a Joint Assembly with elected members from the ACP countries as delegates, rather than ambassadors or ministers from their respective governments. This is part of the new agreement. Second, the new agreement allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which will enable us to work much more effectively in the future. These assemblies are subordinate to the Joint Assembly. A highly productive regional debate has already taken place in Nassau in the Caribbean. Another regional debate is planned for Abuja in West Africa. I want to transform the Joint Assembly so that it is no longer just a club for discussions, but a workshop for working on improving the living conditions of all people in developing countries. I want to give civil society a louder voice. To achieve this, we must overcome corruption and address this goal head-on. We must reward states that strive for good governance. But we should also take tough action against states where corruption is prevalent or where the pluralistic governments we demand are constitutionally prevented. I am pleased with the developments in Zimbabwe. European taxpayers will no longer allow their money to be misappropriated. A wind of change must sweep across Africa; new standards must be set and maintained. The Joint Assembly, together with the Commission, should take a leading role in monitoring the legal enshrinement of good governance, human rights, and democracy. I am confident that the elected delegates of the EU and the ACP states are equal to this task. I ask you to support this report. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report. The foundation of all development policy considerations must be respect for human rights and the fight against poverty. If poverty must be combated, then the reduction in funding for development aid in many Member States and in the EU is in stark contradiction to this. Looking ahead, when it comes to financing, the Joint Assembly must be provided with additional resources, which will enable it to deploy election observers at the request of the ACP states, for example. In the future, the EU must, on the one hand, adopt a more diverse approach to coordinating development projects and, on the other, coordinate better with individual states in order to work more efficiently and use resources more effectively."	de
"In a debate in the Socialist Party about the Irish process, someone said the following: ""In the end, the solution in Ireland was for all parties involved to make the following consideration: Is it so important to be Irish or English? Let each person be what they want to be, because if Ireland and England are in the European Union, it is not worth killing because you are English or Irish. What difference does it make if from now on national schemes will no longer work!@ In this case we could ask the same question: is it so important to be Basque or Spanish or European? We discuss a lot about what it means to be Basque, but today Basques dress like Danes and read the same things as English people. If life is destined to develop in a much larger space - which is already happening - and if our children will certainly live in this Europe, what sense is there in killing each other for these reasons? He used to say B and probably in Ireland this reflection has been assimilated by everyone -: ""But if we are killing for nothing B and there they were really killing because there were paramilitary gangs from all sides involved -, in the Basque Country we should also ask ourselves this question out loud: what does it matter if it is all the same? Be what you want to be. If in the near future we are going to function in a European context in the economic, political and vital decision-making fields for each country, it is not worth killing for this. Neither killing nor dying for this@. May he rest in peace. (Loud applause) B (ES) Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, I would like to convey to the families of Fernando Buesa, representative of the Basque people, and Jorge Díez, member of the Basque police, the expressions of our deepest solidarity, which we naturally extend to the family of the Socialist Party of the Basque Country. Madam President, sadly, in recent times in this Chamber we have had to talk about European extremism. Whatever their meaning, in the end, they are all different expressions of the same thing. Faced with all this, we democrats cannot resign ourselves to the peace of the dead; on the contrary, we must be strengthened by knowing that, in the Basque Country, the only social fracture that exists is the abyss that separates those who kill and those who support and understand them from the vast majority of the Basque people, who simply aspire to live in peace and freedom. (Loud applause) B (ES) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I express the most categorical and firm condemnation of the terrorist attack of 22 February in Vitoria, which cost the lives of the Socialist deputy and spokesman for the Basque Parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez. We reiterate that, in a State governed by the rule of law, a member of the European Union, it is possible to defend any idea and any option, provided that these are expressed in a democratic manner and are part of the defence of respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice, freedom and economic and social progress on which the Union is based, which moreover does not, evidently, allow the transgression of these principles, as clearly established in the Treaties."	it
"Berend Report (A5-0107/1999) We essentially share the rapporteur's assessment and considerations regarding the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union. We will therefore limit ourselves to highlighting a few aspects. First, as the Commission points out, the fact that the sharp increase in GDP per capita in some poorer regions between 1991 and 1996 was largely determined by the inclusion of the new German Länder in the calculations of the Community average, starting precisely from the first of those years, which evidently led to a significant reduction in the level of GDP per capita in the Union. Furthermore, we consider particularly important the observation that the recovery in some regions—where it did occur—was accompanied by minimal growth in employment, which consequently requires new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of concern in this regard. This situation contradicts the relegation of the adoption of employment promotion measures to the exclusive internal domain of the Member States, as the report does. Finally—and this is not unimportant—a reference to the rapporteur's proposal that in the future this type of report should also include, among other aspects, an analysis of the interregional development of cohesion in each of the States. The multiplicity of situations and the differentiated developments that occur from region to region, within the same State, indeed require a more in-depth evaluation of this issue in order to allow for and guarantee corrections in regional (and other) policies with a view to ensuring cohesion within each of the Member States. (FR) The Berend report offers an interesting analysis of the situation and economic development of the regions of the European Union. However, the French delegation of the Union for a Europe of the Nations Group cannot but disagree with some of the statements it contains. Thus, paragraph 26 ""emphasizes the need to consolidate the budget as a precondition for the success of Economic and Monetary Union and the enlargement of the Union."" At a time when Member States are forced to follow a budgetary slimming diet to meet the convergence criteria—a diet they have, moreover, imposed on themselves—the federalists are displaying a most surprising display of financial greed. As a sign of recognition of the failure of cohesion policy and EMU, the inadequacy of the results achieved is entered into the overdraft account, and everyone vie with each other in eloquence to demand more appropriations, without anyone questioning the effectiveness of the funds used. What can be said about budget management that consists of setting a spending target rather than a spending ceiling, of searching at all costs for projects to spend approved appropriations at all costs, rather than allocating appropriations for existing projects?"	es
We must affirm gender equality, the famous gender mainstreaming, which is one of the least developed topics in the Prodi Commission's agenda. And this means prioritizing gender equality, adapting the social model, and, above all, a clear fight against populism in a situation where our economic and social cohesion is threatened, and this is also something that must appear as a top priority in the Commission's work. And this must be complemented by a clear fight against racism and intolerance to be able to affirm in practice the evolution of a Union that has become a magnet for the rest of the world and a zone of immigration, given its prosperity and its autumnal demographics. And this, I believe, must be the first objective we must pursue. In this regard, I would also add another element, which is economic governance, with a single currency—I believe it is essential—and also an issue on which the Commission must make progress. I would like—my group would certainly like—with regard to the ambitious objectives and, above all, with something important that the Commission has done, which is to adopt this enlargement in the negotiation and integration process, for there to be more clarity regarding the revision of Agenda 2000. Does the Commission think there will be no revision until the end? And the issue of imposition also seems absolutely key to us. Regarding governance in general, I think a theoretical reflection could be very interesting. I would draw attention to one thing: it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here. I would clearly be in favor of subsidiarity. If we are able to define our area of governance, I think it would be very positive. Otherwise, I believe that subsidiarity also applies to reflection. It should not only be the Commission, but also our States, our Parliaments, and our civil society who reflect on it. Finally, Madam President, I would like to make a brief reference to the last objective, which we consider absolutely fundamental: the stabilization of the continent and the strengthening of Europe's role in the world. There, I would say that there is agreement and support regarding the priority of southeastern Europe, with enlargement and—as I have already mentioned—with the integration process and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean program and our capacity for conflict prevention, and with an issue that is rarely discussed, namely the North-South challenge. We must not forget Africa, which is the continent absolutely abandoned not only by God but also by Europe, nor our significant contribution to development cooperation. And finally, an issue in which we are increasingly responsible, as the world's leading economic and trading power, which is the voice of the European Union in the world. This requires not only an active stance in relation to the Millennium Round. It requires the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions, in which Europe has an enormous responsibility.	es
In my view, the Commission's proposal must include elements that allow for greater transparency in the workings of several institutions, but there is certainly always room for improvement. We are prepared to examine the proposals put forward in this regard. The question raised by Jonas Sjöstedt and other Members is a very important one. In Sweden, there is the principle of openness, which strengthens democracy and promotes positive dialogue between citizens, decision-makers, and authorities. We are keen for the EU to follow this path, which is indeed supported by the Treaty of Amsterdam. A few years ago, Parliament adopted a Lööw report, which is very important in this context. It warned that future developments would lead to a restriction of the principle of openness in the Member States. We can now see that Parliament's warning may have had some justification. I would like to ask the Council, in light of the Commission's working documents, whether it can understand this warning. I listened carefully to the President-in-Office of the Council's comments on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference. My question now is whether I can conclude from Mr. Seixas da Costa's truly interesting remarks on the issues mentioned that the Portuguese Presidency is committed to examining and supporting the expansion of the IGC's agenda. The issue of transparency in the functioning of the institutions must not, in any way, be examined in secret, or in conjunction with other issues or within certain corridors—although I too know how important corridors are. This requires a specific item on the IGC's agenda, which must therefore be expanded. Mr. President, the issue of transparency is an issue that is naturally linked to the institutions. This IGC is, at least initially, based on the focus on the more optimal functioning of the institutions, taking into account, in particular, the desire we all have for the institutions to be more democratic, transparent, and efficient. All of this, however, within a general framework of global acceptance of all the solutions we can find to achieve these three objectives. Clearly, this issue of transparency will remain on the European agenda in the long term, and it will evidently be on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference. I can assure you that the Portuguese Presidency will continue to raise this issue with the Member States and the representatives in the Conference's preparatory group. In this area, it must be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament, who are certainly motivated to support this proposal. After that, we will examine at ministerial level how to proceed with this process. However, we must acknowledge that we have the Treaty of Amsterdam, adopted in May of last year, that there are a number of measures introducing transparency that are still being implemented, and the question is whether it would be premature to initiate a new procedure in the area of transparency. I believe, however, that it is an issue that must always be on the agenda because there is clearly a certain awareness of the problem on the part of public opinion and because it is linked to the truly necessary responsibility of the European institutions and bodies towards the citizens.	de
"Postal services are not just a mail service, but also a social service. For some, the postman is the only person they meet during the day. We can pay homage to the postmen who, in any weather conditions, walk many kilometres on foot to ensure their service to everyone. Dismantling the postal service, the service of proximity communication, would be a serious mistake; furthermore, the equality of all citizens would not be protected. Pursuing profit at all costs means hindering fraternity and social cohesion. Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution and I would like to explain why. Several speakers have pointed out that, especially in mountain municipalities, the only person with whom the elderly have any contact is the postman. I agree with this observation. However, I believe that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced in line with the state budget. In Italy, my country of origin, there are around 200,000 postal workers and they cost the State around 50 million lire per capita per year, or 25,000 euros. The total cost is therefore around 5 million euros. By liberalising this service, the State budget would be freed up, that is, it would have a surplus of around 10 million lire per year for each pensioner, to be allocated to a million pensioners, who would see their pensions double. This would more than compensate for the sacrifice of not having contact with the postman. Mr President, I voted for the resolution on European postal services with all the greater satisfaction because it once again reiterates the position I have always defended, namely the need for a high-quality universal service, particularly in the less densely populated regions, the rural areas, and there is one in my small country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. In these regions, but also in some districts of large cities, as my colleague Posselt explained, post offices and postmen play a role that I would almost call socio-cultural, which goes beyond the simple delivery of mail. I know that this service is deficient. It would perhaps be less expensive to provide homes or isolated villages with a fax or e-mail service. In principle, I am in favour of abolishing monopolies in the public sector, whether it concerns water, gas, electricity, telephone, antennas, cable networks and so on. However, liberalisation, which has brought considerable advantages to users in terms of prices and quality of services, especially in the telephone sector, must stop where the supply of the service becomes insufficient or disappears, where the companies that benefit from liberalisation are not profitable. If they cannot be forced to provide a service that the state monopoly has guaranteed, in particular through the obligation of a universal service, it is necessary to maintain the public service. I think we can afford to maintain a postal service, even if our P & Ts currently function like businesses. It is clear that they must make an effort to no longer be called ""snail mail"", even if they cannot reach the speed of e-mail."	it
We bear a special responsibility with regard to promoting economic development in this region. The start of talks with Syria has paved the way for the convening of the Multilateral Coordination Group in Moscow at the end of this month. I will attend this meeting and hope that we can finally move the negotiations forward again. The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process, as has been underlined by all sides: Palestinians, Israelis, their Arab neighbors, and the United States. Our role is not limited to that of a financier. We must be prepared to act swiftly to consolidate peace in this region. But we should not deceive ourselves: a comprehensive peace solution in the Middle East comes at a price. The Commission is already examining how the recent encouraging developments will affect the European Union. We will discuss this issue in detail with Parliament and the Council soon. However, I would like to remind Members of the House that the European Union is already providing significant financial support to the peace process. We are the largest donor to the Palestinians. We have also provided substantial financial assistance to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt. With Israel, we have further intensified cooperation in several areas of particular interest to the country. The Community's contribution of more than EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 provided effective support to the Palestinian Authority and significantly assisted the reconstruction of the dilapidated infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Member States of the European Union jointly provided a further EUR 860 million during this crucial phase. In this context, I welcome the important steps recently taken by the Palestinian Authority to improve budgetary transparency. President Arafat will meet with the Council of Ministers next week. This meeting will provide a good opportunity to discuss the need for equally bold measures to improve Palestinian administration and strengthen the rule of law. The Commission is actively involved in these efforts. The Commission has also increased its planned support for regional Israeli-Arab cooperation projects. Last year, we allocated more than EUR 20 million to these projects. This package included additional funding for citizens' initiatives and cross-border Israeli-Arab cooperation at non-governmental and expert levels. Members will be aware that the European Union is the largest donor to efforts towards reconciliation between the peoples of the Middle East. Other potential areas for Community support will emerge in the next phase of the peace process. This includes support for an agreement for the Golan Heights, under which we can support security arrangements as well as mine clearance and the reconstruction of communities in the Golan Heights. Economic development in Syria needs support to ensure the successful transition from a war economy to a peace economy. Reconstruction and rehabilitation measures in southern Lebanon, the only region in the Middle East where military conflict remains, will also require considerable efforts.	de
"Anyone who threatens, in principle, the production of this factory by demanding repayment of the aid granted at the time is threatening not only this steelworks but also an employer in this region on which small and medium-sized enterprises naturally depend. It goes without saying that this cannot be the European Union's competition policy. If we want competition, we must achieve this combination of the needs of the national economy and the demands of businesses. This is also the only chance of developing economic circuits in underdeveloped regions that lead to the social protection of citizens and the strengthening of purchasing power. Furthermore, we must without hesitation consider an economic policy geared more towards demand rather than solely towards supply. Mr President, since my election to the European Parliament in 1994, I have never read a report imbued with as much anti-Irish sentiment and overtones as the Jonckheer report we are debating today. I would like to quote the report verbatim: ""State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland, with the latter country clearly leading the way when national aid and aid from the regional and social Community are added together."" I believe the rapporteur is simply playing with figures. I find it difficult to understand how he can introduce social and regional funds into this mathematical equation. I would like to remind him that the European Union approved the new guidelines for regional aid for the period after 2000, which was simply an extension of the policy objectives designed to complete the internal market within Europe. Regional disparities must be overcome if we want the internal market to be successful and prosperous. I welcome the fact that 40% aid and an additional 15% aid for SMEs for fixed-income investments will be authorized for companies setting up in Objective I regions in Europe after the year 2000. I remind Mr. Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies established in Ireland still have to cross two seas to reach the European market on the continent. No other Member State is disadvantaged to this extent. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, the prohibition of cartels is the very heart of a functioning legal order in Europe. The Commission has found the practical implementation of the monitoring of this prohibition to be unsatisfactory: let us say straight away that we approve. But opinions differ on the solution. Formally, the Commission's proposal does not depart from the prohibition of cartels, but ultimately, this proposal is a transition from prohibition subject to authorization to authorization subject to prohibition. We are moving from the principle of prohibition to the principle of abuse. Along with other colleagues, I resolutely reject a systemic change of this magnitude. I do not accept that a transposition problem can motivate a practical change in the legal system. We are amending the law to make it enforceable again: I find this unacceptable."	fr
I shall give the floor for all procedural points at the end of voting time. Report (A5-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of measures in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta (COM(1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0/0199(CNS)) Amendments 22 and 24 Madam President, I should like to criticise the absence of the current Presidency of the Council. I believe that, when it comes to these third pillar issues and these agreements which are so important for the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, it is unacceptable that the current Presidency is not here today. I would also like to speak about the problem of translations. I'll just give one example, because we don't have time, but this is a case where translations are very important because of the very precise legal terms involved. Amendment 83 states in Italian, the original language, that 'the minor must assist a person in his fiducia or in an external legal position.' This 'external legal position' becomes 'neutered lawyer' in the French version, and I don't know what a neuter lawyer is. I think that's a contradiction in terms. But in the Spanish version, the word 'lawyer' disappears entirely; there is no lawyer at all. Madam President—you've said it several times—this is a very serious problem. In this matter, I believe the legal-linguistic experts will have to do meticulous work to arrive at a sensible version. Absolutely, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this is not the first time, and it is indeed very worrying. We will look into this problem and check all the translations. Madam President, before the vote, I just wanted to echo Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi's sentiments and say that I very much regret the Council's absence from this debate on such important votes on third-pillar matters. I would like you, Madam President, to convey to the Council our wish that it be present at such votes in the future. Absolutely; I am well aware that the absence of Council representatives is not normal, and I will be happy to convey that. Amendment 31 Madam President, I would like to add that in the phrase - I will read it out in French, as that is the version I have to hand - the words 'par le droit de l'Etat membre requis ou requérant que la personne donne son consentiment' should be added. (Parliament adopted the draft legislative resolution.) Madam President, I would just like to point out that, in the heat of the moment, I forgot to tell you that in the Spanish version of my report on the deficit, there is an error in the last paragraph: instead of saying 'la propuesta nos parece correcta', an 's' has been omitted, and it says 'la propuesta no parece correcta', which means exactly the opposite. It is just a matter of correcting that.

"(The sitting adjourned at 11:50 p.m.) Resumption of sitting The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed. Are there any objections? (Parliament approved the Minutes.) Mr President, I should like to comment on a meeting of various Members of this Parliament from all political groups, which took place yesterday evening in the presence of several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, as well as the architects who built this Chamber, to discuss ways of further improving our work. At that meeting, we noticed that behind the pretty white curtain behind your platform, Mr President, there is in fact a large window. When you raise the curtain, it seems to reveal a magnificent view across the river, but, we were told, this curtain remains closed so that you are not sitting against the light and so that we have better light during the debate. What prevents us, however, from opening the curtain before debates begin or during adjournments, so that we can enjoy a little – free of charge – of that supposedly magnificent view behind you? I'm perfectly happy for our plenary chamber to be illuminated by the brilliance of our debates, but I think it would be even better if real sunlight could illuminate our ""dome of democracy"" from time to time. It would seem appropriate if you, with the ushers, could explore the possibility of opening the curtain from time to time. Thank you very much, Mr. Colleague. I am grateful for any suggestion that could make our meeting room more humane. I would like to suggest the following: We will continue with the meeting as it is in the room. In the meantime, I will check whether this is technically feasible. If so, let's conduct a half-hour trial to see what it looks like with the President sitting backlit. UCITS Mr. President, Commissioner, colleagues, I hope that Parliament is ready today to take decisions on expanding and strengthening the financial market in Europe. For me, as a new Member of the European Parliament, it has been very interesting and instructive to be entrusted with responsibility for this important matter. I would particularly like to thank my colleagues in the committee for their willingness to compromise, for the openness of the President and the Bureau in the face of the complexity of the issue, for the good contacts with the Commission, especially with the Commissioner, and with the Council, and also for the selfless work of the Committee Secretariat. There was broad agreement in the committee, except for one point on which we hope to reach a solution. The issue of certain undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) may seem complicated and technically and politically risky. I believe some people don't even know what UCITS means. However, let me state very clearly that this is an issue that truly affects the citizens of Europe. It concerns how their savings are managed, what choices are available, how competition works between countries regarding different forms of savings, what security requirements savers have, and what options European citizens have for wise retirement provision."	de
That being said, to govern is to foresee, it is also to be responsible, and in this new, imposed context, competition law naturally has an essential role to play. In this area, the Commission has prioritized several lines of action: by acting on the structure of the markets by actively pursuing anti-competitive practices, by refocusing the control activity of its services on only those cases presenting a clear Community interest and by signaling its desire to modernize competition law. As regards State aid, we must ensure that the system is not made more cumbersome and the introduction of a public register, in which all aid would be recorded, does not seem desirable to us, because this onerous obligation would naturally run counter to attempts to alleviate bureaucratic constraints. Finally, with regard to the modernization of the application of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not believe that a decentralized application is necessarily a step in the right direction. Indeed, the Commission not only retains the power to remove a case from the jurisdiction of national authorities, but national courts are also clearly obliged to avoid any conflict with the Commission's decisions. National states would thus become the Commission's secular arm for ensuring compliance with the application of rules over which they have no control. In conclusion, I would say that while certain measures are going in the right direction, we will naturally remain vigilant in order to avoid a federalist spiral that would be detrimental to Europe and the sovereignty of states. Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, we express a generally positive opinion of the Commission's White Paper on Competition, particularly with regard to the abolition of the notification and authorization system, but we still have some doubts. Above all, there is the risk that the decentralization of powers to individual states, which is necessary in many respects, could lead to an abnormal expansion of competition initiatives and encourage someone to use antitrust not as an ultimate guarantee of the efficient and predictable functioning of markets, but as an instrument of economic and industrial policy, of planning and interference with the spontaneous dynamics of the markets themselves, or even as an instrument serving protectionist visions. In this regard, I believe we should draw inspiration from the writings of von Eieck and certainly from those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni, who denounced the risks of an abnormal expansion of anti-competitive policies. The most serious damage to the market, to competition and to the free choice of European consumers is still today attributable to state interference in the economy. We know about state aid to businesses—we've talked about it—we still feel a strong state presence in the economy—just think that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of the stock market capitalization—and there are the obstacles that governments and central banks are putting in the way of mergers and acquisitions. We've often talked in recent weeks about the Vodafone-Mannesmann affair and the rescue of Holzmann.	fr
Cross-border workers, posted workers and migrants, as well as jobseekers, trainees and students, are hindered in the exercise of their right to free movement by the lack of coordination and convergence in the area of social protection. The same phenomenon is also evident in the area of taxation. In order to combat distortions of competition and prevent social dumping, the Commission has developed an approach that seems to me to be balanced because it follows a middle path between harmonisation and non-intervention. On the one hand, it uses mandatory and binding rules on equal pay or supplementary pension schemes, and on the other, it uses incentive programmes to combat discrimination and social exclusion. Building on a long series of recommendations, reports and communications, the Commission has taken a further step towards convergence by setting clear objectives and also by setting up a working group of high-level officials. Both proposals have already been adopted by the Council. It is therefore now a question of supporting this approach in order to arrive, within a reasonable timeframe, at being able to judge with full knowledge of the facts whether, to what extent and in what way the European Union should proceed with a reorganisation of social protection, which has been made inevitable by enlargement, globalisation, the ageing of the population, the individualisation of society and the transformation of family structures. Denying these transformations means, in fact, condemning social protection to death. To Eurosceptics and nationalists, I reiterate that a social protection system that remains limited to the borders of a Member State does not deserve the name of social and does not offer effective protection. The dismantling of social protection systems dictated by competitive motives also undermines the role of this system as a productive factor: lower levels of social protection lead to a reduction in purchasing power, a smaller number of workers in good health and less satisfied workers. I would remind Eurofanatics that a European social protection system is neither feasible nor desirable. Both in terms of services and entitlements, and in terms of income and benefits, the differences between the Member States are too great to allow for standardisation. The path taken by the Commission is therefore fully understandable and has the advantage of clarity: data is collected and experiences are exchanged in order to agree on common objectives, to develop sound comparative indicators and to issue recommendations. I fully agree with this approach. I support the Commission's proposal and I hope that a further step forward can be taken in Lisbon. Mr President, Mr Andersson's report contains many interesting elements. Unfortunately, the most interesting aspect is that the report, which should focus on the overall strategy for the modernisation of social policy, instead proposes an expansion of traditional social policy, with a greater supranational component in this area. Social policy must be renewed, so that unemployment in the Member States can fall. Even if the socialists, because there are now so many governments with a social democratic majority, talk much less about unemployment than in the past, unemployment is still high. This despite a favorable international situation.	it
"The second aspect to be taken into consideration with regard to policy coherence is that of development policy in the context of the Union's foreign policy. We know that the Union is experiencing a new dimension in its foreign policy, we know that with the creation of the High Representative, the Rapid Intervention Force, the Military Crisis Management Centre, there is a whole dynamic of affirmation of the European Union that we cannot disdain when we consider the role of development policies and also that there are aspects linked to political dialogue, the adoption of common positions or actions, the preparation of common strategies, preventive diplomacy, the development of regional capacities for crisis prevention and management. Undoubtedly, all these aspects will not fail to make important contributions to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union's foreign policy, as regards its implementation and development. Let us say that at this level too, at the level of the European Union, the framing of development policy in the context of foreign policy will certainly have to follow the same path as that taken by the development policies of many Member States, in the context of their respective foreign policies. Its affirmation necessarily presupposes a strengthening of the decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures of CFSP means, which allow for better articulation between the instruments of development policy and the instruments of foreign policy. In this context, our conviction is that we must move from a post-colonial paradigm to a truly European paradigm of development policy, knowing, as we know, that development policy has been strongly conditioned in the European context by the policies of certain Member States, according to the post-colonial references of the policies of these States. The third aspect that must be considered is that of the policy of the European Union and the policy of the Member States. Policy coherence at the level of the European Union certainly presupposes better coordination of the policies of the Member States with the policy of the European Union in the field of development. If it proves impossible to establish better mechanisms for coherence between national policies, it will certainly be difficult to think of a more coherent framework for the European Union's development policy. The fourth and final aspect I would like to put to you, still concerning development policies, concerns the role of the Development Council. There has been discussion, particularly in recent months, about the role that the Development Council can play in the context of Union policies. We know that the difference in status between development policies and other policies at Union level is flagrant - one only has to see the difficult conditions in which the communitarisation or non-communitarisation of the EDF was settled - and it is difficult to admit that we can develop more coherence in the policies of the European Union without a more active and more interventionist role of the ""Development"" Council in the taking of political decisions which eminently concern the competence of development and which take place within other councils, other decision-making centres, which range from the ""Agriculture and Fisheries"" Council to the Environment Council, but in relation to which the ""Development"" Council has had no opportunity to be heard or to intervene until now."	fr
The United Nations has a peace plan. We should seize this opportunity to end the latest colonialist episode in Africa. I would also like to discuss the issue of migration. I am concerned about the new provisions in the partnership agreement we have concluded with the ACP countries, which aim to make it easier to turn back immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees for less clearly established reasons. I would also really like to see the EU act as a pioneer on the issue of patents on living organisms. We now know that every four seconds, a human being dies of hunger. Three-quarters of these famine victims are children under the age of five. This is not due to a lack of food, but to what we have talked about so much today: increasing poverty. Food security and the protection of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests. I believe that the sole purpose of granting patents on living organisms would be to control the world's food supply, especially for commercial purposes, and for no other purpose. I would also like to see in this report, which I hope the Commission will submit to us, some information on the role of women. In all contexts, and particularly in development policy, women seem to be completely absent - but in fact, this is not the case. Mr President, our debate today highlights the need to discuss development policy in terms that go much further than simply increasing the flow of aid. The level of such aid is, of course, important, and it should be increased for all rich countries. This is particularly necessary to combat poverty and to build capacity in the regions concerned. The level of aid, however, is only one of many instruments that have a significant influence on the development of poor countries. A number of my colleagues today mentioned areas that are important beyond aid, and where the contrasts and oppositions between different policy sectors have very serious consequences. These included trade policy, and agricultural and fisheries policy. Other equally important elements could, of course, be mentioned: the flow of private investment, cooperation in the fields of research and technology, and the way in which the international community addresses various global problems that concern us all, and the financing of corresponding measures. These problems include climate issues, biodiversity, public health issues, and so on. This observation is further accentuated by globalization, this new form of economy that we are seeing spreading. The links between the different policy areas are further strengthened. What we are discussing today in this Chamber, in my view, is partly the EU's contribution to the debate on globalisation, on the opportunities it offers and the risks it entails, and on the rules of the game that must be established to ensure that poor countries have real opportunities for development. It is, of course, absolutely essential to study, or summarise, as Mrs Maij-Weggen has requested, the overlaps between the various policy areas and the resulting contradictions. I can only wonder why the Commission has not done more in this regard.	fr
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to congratulate you on having reconciled Europe with the idea that the modernisation of the economy and social cohesion are compatible concepts. The preparation for the Lisbon Summit has shown that we are not working enough in Europe, and that if we want to be the most dynamic region in the world, we must not only work more, but work with more information and the ability to use it. To increase the employment rate and finance social protection systems, we are forced to work longer and, above all, we must be able to count on a greater number of women in the world of work, and with better knowledge. We hope that this Lisbon Summit will help to change the current model of female employment. I would like to ask you, Mr President, whether you expect this Summit to produce conclusions that will enable us to take concrete measures within a set timeframe so that there are more women in the world of work, and above all in the new knowledge economy. Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to you and would like to thank you for the important and excellent contributions you have made to this debate on the preparation of the extraordinary Lisbon Summit. I believe that this debate and the participation of Parliament were necessary because I think that Europe still lacks a strategic direction; and to make this strategic direction possible, an institutional alliance is needed that goes beyond natural political divergences. Such an alliance is, among other things, already fully achieved thanks to the excellent cooperation of the Commission, led by Romano Prodi, and its document for the preparation of the Lisbon Summit. However, Parliament must also play an essential role. I would like it to be possible at the Lisbon Summit not only to agree on a strategy, but also to define a set of concrete measures and an open method of coordination. In this regard, I will give you two examples that are connected, among other things, with everything that has been said here about the concrete measures that I would like to see approved. The first example is that by 2002 all schools and training institutes in Europe should be connected to the Internet and, at the same time, should have the staff required to provide the training needed to ensure that young people leaving compulsory school and all those in vocational training, whether unemployed or not, can acquire a kind of ""license"" for the information society that allows them to use computers and surf the Internet. If this were to happen, we would then have created the conditions for information technology not to be a factor in social disruption, in increasing the gap between those who are successful and those who are not, but instead to become an important vector for integration, an important means of combating exclusion. The second example is that we have spoken about women in the labour market and equal opportunities for men and women in society in general. The concrete measures connected to what I have just defined as a common objective for support services for families and, in particular, for children, constitute a decisive factor for the creation of jobs and, at the same time, make equal opportunities concrete by increasing the participation of women in the labour market."	it
Europe's environmental problems can never be solved by one person alone. Finally, for those who still harbor doubts for economic reasons: just consider how high the cost of cleaning up our seas would otherwise be! The time will come when we are faced with such demands. Then we will be grateful that we have done everything in our power to prevent oil discharges. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to say very briefly that no one doubts the need for a directive on this issue. This is a serious problem not only for Europe, but for all the world's oceans, and therefore effective and urgent measures are required. I would like to make it clear that there are a number of universal principles with which we therefore fully agree. First, all ports must have the necessary waste treatment facilities. Second, the polluter pays principle applies, of course. I acknowledge that there may be differences of opinion regarding the exceptions regarding ship types and sizes. However, we cannot start a battle that distorts competition between the various ports, leaving us with a situation where a series of theoretically environmental measures designed to protect the coast or the sea ultimately distorts competition between the various ports. Effective measures must therefore be taken on this point, because if we do not find an appropriate solution, this directive will ultimately be a complete failure. It will only benefit some ports to the detriment of others, all because of fine words about the environment that conceal a competitive struggle between ports. A logical approach, for example, would be to establish the principle of a single tariff for all European ports, an absolutely identical tariff that would not cause any distortion of competition or have any similar consequences. Any decision that, for example, allows Member States to subsidize various ports would distort competition and ultimately be ineffective. Mr President, I share with you all a love of the sea, diving, and sailing, and I am convinced that everyone here is concerned about how we will be able to guarantee clean seas for present and future generations. I believe the work being discussed here today is a major step forward. In this spirit, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr. Bouwman, and the entire Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the meticulous work they have done throughout the debate and throughout the preparation of this initiative. As you know, marine pollution is a matter of great concern to the Commission. At the earliest opportunity, I hope to be able to send you an initial package of measures for better monitoring of safety on oil tankers—measures that I hope we can all advance together, especially in light of the dramatic shipwreck of the Erika. This dramatic circumstance may perhaps enable us this time to go beyond certain very specific interests, which will undoubtedly be affected by the measures I shall propose in the near future. However, even if accidents are the cause of major problems and major disasters, it is a fact that most discharges do not result from accidents, but simply from the habitual, completely reckless cleaning of bilges by some ships.	de
"We should give more responsibility to local resources by ensuring that they are adequately funded. This would create development that would benefit from local activity and continue even after the funding phase has ended. We should ensure that all projects are implemented through the commitment of local actors. Mr President, thanks to this regulation, the European Union has an instrument and a legal but also political responsibility to integrate the environmental dimension into development policy, and this obviously presupposes an adequate financial allocation. For this reason, like one of my predecessors, I support the rapporteur's Amendment No 11. Since environmental integration is a long-term commitment, I would in principle be against setting a deadline for the validity of the regulation. However, the arguments that lengthy negotiations with the Council would damage existing projects and those in the process of being implemented have convinced me otherwise. I also believe that Amendment No 11 is a good idea. 9, which aims to promote the participation of civil society in the exchange of information and the implementation of the regulation, is very important, because in my opinion the debate on civil society and good governance cannot be limited to fine words, but must be translated into concrete political actions. I also support the rapporteur's proposal for a bipartite comitology procedure: the guidelines would be adopted using a management procedure, while the measures concerning implementation would be adopted using the consultative procedure. We hope that we are close to the conclusion of the process that began a year ago during the previous legislature. In addition to the importance of the issue itself, this regulation and the accompanying regulation on tropical forests are the first regulations on development cooperation to be subject to the codecision procedure. For many of us, this is an interesting learning experience. The previous regulation expired at the end of 1999 and since the beginning of this year the Commission has not been able to make new financial commitments on these budget lines, which puts the Commission and the European Union in an increasingly difficult situation. Hence our eagerness to conclude the adoption process in the near future. In this context, we supported the informal negotiations between the Council Presidency and the Parliament's rapporteur in order to arrive at a proposal acceptable to both sides. The main points of disagreement concerned the financial reference amounts, the comitology and the duration of the regulation. I would like to make a brief comment on each of these points. A few words on the financial reference amount. We accept the compromise proposals presented in Amendment No 1. 11. As regards comitology, our position has always been to defend the advisory procedure rather than the management procedure for the Regulation, pursuant to Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 which states ""The management procedure should be followed as regards management measures such as those relating to the application of the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy or the implementation of programmes which have significant budgetary implications."""	it
But if we only diagnose the inconsistencies of our policies, we will be utterly frustrated, and what's more, the diagnosis will be negative. As with the systems of forces in classical physics, it makes no sense to set in motion policies that inhibit one another. The result of this absurd game is not zero, but would be a negative value made up of material, financial, and human resources wasted in a useless effort. A negative value that, in politics, is multiplied by the number of results that are always not achieved when one measure cancels out the effects sought by another. In today's globalized world, this truth is even more evident. There are no limits to Community policies either. I am therefore pleased that the Commission and the Council have rediscovered their interest in the coherence of Community policies and that they intend to shape the European Union's development cooperation policy, along with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the Commission's departments. Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency include in their respective work plans the desire to integrate coherence into policies that have a very significant impact on developing countries, but without listing concrete measures in which this coherence will be reflected. Both institutions identify the main areas in which this concept should be applied. The Commission, for example, states in its long-term guidelines that the objective of sustainable development must be expressed in strong solidarity, supported by a trade policy that takes common interests into account. The Commission refers to a very important area: trade policy. To this, however, we in Parliament want to add the policies on development aid, agriculture, fisheries, migration, the position in international financial institutions, foreign policy and common security, and structural adjustment aid. The Council, as Mr. Luis Amado said this morning, has spoken on several occasions about the need for coherence—most recently in November 1999, but also on other occasions, such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997—but without any concrete results. We agree with what the Development Council has outlined—which is very important—and can say little, as someone else has already pointed out in their speech. As Parliament, however, we would like to propose—as has also been said and is called for in the resolution—the creation of an inter-directorate working group, including those responsible for all the policies mentioned, and the creation of an observatory on the coherence of the various Community policies, capable of anticipating the impact of each policy on developing countries and on each other. But the fact is that we want to be realistic, and it is not lost on us that pursuing these objectives of coordination, complementarity, and the most complex of which we are discussing, coherence, requires a more sophisticated policy than we currently have in the European Union. Let us hope—and we do—that the winds of change brought about by the Intergovernmental Conference, the reform of the Commission—which will also affect development services—this new parliamentary term, and the prospects of enlargement will guide us to further perfect a more coherent political union.	de
I was delighted to learn last week that, for several years, the Commission has been paying close attention to the concept of subsidiarity and referring to it in relations not only between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Union, the Member States, the regions and cities. I hope that Commissioner Barnier, by continuing the dialogue in the regions of Europe, will develop this idea and learn from what he hears. Commissioner, I refer to one of your answers to the previous questions in which you mentioned what I call the possibilities of locking the Treaty in the face of risks of deviance, and in particular the diversification of sanctions that can be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for violation of fundamental freedoms. Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this nature, can be part of the mandate of the IGC as it was defined in Helsinki? For my part, I do not have that impression. Aren't you afraid that such sanctions could get out of hand and serve to punish, not human rights violations, but simple differences of opinion, or divergences from the dominant European thinking? Yes, Mr. Bonde, we are going to begin this debate with 700 young people in Brussels. It so happens that they will be working in the institutions and with the Commission, and I think this is a good start for this dialogue with motivated young people. Regarding social protection, I confirm that we have made proposals on the basis of qualified majority or unanimity, without ideology. In your country, Mr. Bonde, as everywhere, I believe we are committed to the proper functioning of the internal market, to the fairest conditions of competition and movement for goods and people. And so that is our rule. We are proposing that certain policies or measures in the areas of taxation, social protection and social security be decided by qualified majority when there is a direct link with the proper functioning of the internal market. Our proposal is not general, nor is it systematic. I am well aware of the sensitivity of these issues of taxation and social protection. I do not think that all national social protection systems should be put in the same mold; that was never the question, but simply to ensure, in a Europe of thirty or twenty-seven countries, the best conditions for the functioning of the internal market without one State being able to block the other 26 or 27. Mr MacCormick, yes, I confirm that this dialogue must go beyond national capitals, that it must go as close as possible to the people, where they live, where they have roots, and if I told you anything else, I would not be agreeing with myself, as Commissioner responsible for regional policy, that is to say one of the most concrete, most visible policies, which is designed to help employment and the quality of life of people in their region, and you will often hear me say that this policy is not only designed for the priority objective of cohesion and solidarity between regions, it is also designed as a complement so that people, wherever they live, can maintain their roots, their traditions, their soul, their identity.	fr
The two presidents rightly did not include this issue in their dossier. Everything must remain in its place and have its own priorities. In my opinion, the two highest representatives of Parliament and the Commission were right to address the most delicate points of the peace process, which, as we know, is still encountering quite a few difficulties. We must absolutely support this peace process, and the attention we are paying to the phenomena denounced in Mrs. Morgantini's question does not contain any prejudice against either party. It reflects our friendly severity, our severity towards the friendly government of Israel, so that these illegalities and irregularities do not recur because they harm everyone. From this point of view too, this initiative must be seen as a positive development, as an initiative that seeks to encourage the peace process in the Middle East. Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current trade agreement between Israel and the European Community is indeed quite confusing. Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to determine the origin of the products in question. I therefore also believe that it is desirable to clarify this issue quickly. However, we must take into account a whole series of other essential factors. We all agree that the recent resumption of peace negotiations must be encouraged and not hindered. At the moment, the Israelis and the Palestinians are intensively negotiating their future borders. Any attempt by anyone, any third party, to define, or even impose, the territorial scope is therefore premature. In my opinion, it is preferable to await the outcome of the trilateral working group on rules of origin to be set up at the initiative of Israel, the European Commission and the Palestinians. I am pleased that the Commissioner shares this view. Let us hope that this working group will find a temporary solution to the problem within the existing legal framework, without jeopardizing the peace process, because this process must be considered an absolute priority, especially by the European Community, and Europe cannot put obstacles in its way. There seems to be a remarkable consensus today in the House, but I would like to make a few comments. Here in Parliament, trade in the Middle East has always been an extremely sensitive political issue. We are major donors, but we have unfortunately been sidelined in terms of policy and political influence for too long in the Middle East, and we can contribute positively, as many speakers have pointed out today, just as we did in the case of Northern Ireland. We are major consumers of the products of Israel and the occupied territories, with trade probably being our main political strength in the region, and our encouragement of the promotion of the rule of law is our main asset in our effort to contribute to the peace agreement. Borders are being closed, sometimes arbitrarily, sometimes following a terrorist attack.	fr
Under the system proposed in these directives, third-country nationals wishing to travel to the United Kingdom under the procedures described will be able to do so with a services provision card issued by another Member State, thereby circumventing border controls in the United Kingdom. If any changes are to be made to the current UK border provisions, they should be made by the UK Government and the UK Parliament and not en passant through the European legislative process. For this reason, we will vote against both proposals. Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur and Mr. Wieland, who have taken the time to summarize with striking consistency the various amendments and concerns relating to this report. Both proposals play a fundamental role in transposing the four key principles that lay the foundation for the internal market for the freedom to provide services. The new regulations within the framework of the free provision of cross-border services will certainly benefit the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and capacity of businesses. The development of the EU Service Provider Card—and I agree with Mr. Wieland on this point—must necessarily be governed by strict general conditions, since it helps us prevent potential abuses such as illegal immigration and fraudulent contracts. Why do I consider the directive absolutely essential? I see three reasons: the economic weight of third-country national workers in the EU, the competitiveness of businesses, and the proper functioning of the internal market. That is why, on the one hand, I welcome the rigid regulatory framework and, on the other, I call for the control measures adopted by the Member States to be as effective and as simple as possible. Finally, I would like to ask the Commission a question, since it is asked of me time and again. Will the directive jeopardize the accession negotiations? How do you interpret and explain Article 1, given that it plays an important role for our country, which borders numerous new countries, and the accession negotiations? Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, businesspeople have until now been faced with the reality that two of the most important freedoms, especially the free movement of persons and services, could not yet be applied to them. Indeed, they had to submit to endless bureaucratic procedures in the Member States where they wanted to provide a service. There are approximately 13 million third-country nationals residing in European territory. I assume that the number of businesspeople, although exact figures are unknown, is probably not small. Therefore, until now, their access to the entire territory of the Union was not regulated by Community law. The two proposals for directives presented here aim to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by introducing an EU service provider card.	es
"This is an issue that affects the daily lives of citizens and is key from the perspective of the EU's credibility. It must be acknowledged that the EU has already supported, I would even say extraordinarily, the development of the poorest countries. I am reminded of the state of Portugal and Greece when I drove through these countries for the first time, twenty-five years ago. In this regard, French speakers will surely say to the EU ""cou de chapeau""—that is, I take off my hat. It is true that the EU deserves to be crowned, but, within countries, the gaps between rich and poor regions remain too great. What are the consequences of this? People react by voting with their feet, that is, by going elsewhere in search of bread. Thus, we are forced to repeatedly build schools and hospitals, the entire infrastructure for the same people and in the same country. This is very expensive and also causes very serious social problems. However, the majority of the population would like to live in their home region, provided they are given the opportunities to do so, that is, if there is work. We must provide that opportunity. This is a moral obligation of the EU and of all of us. I believe the solution is to clearly stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit. And by entrepreneurial spirit, I don't mean exclusively the fact of owning a business; rather, I understand the expression as a state of will. I mean the attitude, the desire of a person to prosper in life, whether they are an employee, a business owner, or a civil servant. What is a fair society? It is a society in which anyone from humble origins can prosper in life, so that their children can enjoy a more comfortable situation. Consequently, optimal regional development is also possible, since citizens do engage in entrepreneurship and work, if they are given the opportunities to do so. In conclusion, I would say that, in this regard, we should take our cue from the United States, where hard work has come back into fashion and success is a manifestation of personal worth, and not an object of envy, as is often the case here in Europe. (FR) Mr. President, as all the speakers have done, I, in turn, would like to thank Mr. Berend and congratulate him on the quality of this work. As with the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it makes, and the observations of Members will be very useful to the Commission in general and, in particular, to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy, as we embark on the programming of the 2000-2006 appropriations. For my part, I would like to make a few observations; first, on the rapporteur's assessment of this sixth periodic report. The honourable Member has emphasized its quality and, if I am not mistaken, has even written that, compared to previous reports, it constitutes a real improvement. On behalf of all the Commission officials and my predecessor, Mrs. Wulf-Mathies, I must tell you that we have been very sensitive to this assessment by the House and by the Honourable Member personally."	es
"That's not so clear in the German text. I would like to ask that it be reviewed again. Otherwise, I would like to thank our rapporteur very much. This is a difficult subject, and I hope that we have presented it in such a way that we can now deal with it better. Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report. I would like to add that Mrs. Frassoni's conciliatory attitude is a welcome change, as is her willingness to compromise with the other institutions. As far as the IGC is concerned, Mrs. Frassoni represents what the French call ""les pures et dures"": no compromises, no negotiations with the other institutions; we would rather block the entire conference than deviate from our positions. Nevertheless, Mrs. Frassoni is prepared to accept the progress achieved, which in no way corresponds to Parliament's original position on the issue of comitology. I would like to remind everyone what is at stake here. Parliament essentially criticized four aspects of the committee system as it existed before the new Council decision and the addition of this interinstitutional agreement. First, the entire system is opaque. It is not transparent; hundreds of committee meetings take place, agendas are not known, and no one knows who sits on the committees. This is where the agreed new system will bring about a real improvement. We will find out who is on each committee. We will be informed when the meetings are taking place. We will receive the agendas. We will receive the documents distributed to the committee members. The entire system, despite its continued complex nature, will become more open and transparent. So this is at least progress. Our second criticism is that the system has severely constrained the Commission. We adopt the legal acts of the European Union, the Commission is tasked with implementing them, and then there's a system that hinders the Commission and makes implementation more difficult. Of particular note here is the so-called ""contre-filet"" procedure, under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even if it could not present an alternative to the implementing measure in question. Here, too, progress has finally been made. The Council can no longer indefinitely block implementing measures after the three-month deadline has expired if there is no qualified majority for them—in other words, if a large portion of the Member States represented in the Council do not reject the measure. This is a more sensible system. This, too, should be considered progress. However, we are less satisfied with our other two points of criticism. First, we criticize the system whereby the Commission is monitored, reviewed, or, if you will, controlled only by a committee appointed by the Member States or the Council, and there is no control by Parliament. The legislative branch, the Council and Parliament, should have equal rights. We confer implementing powers on the Commission, and then only a body appointed by the Council or the Member States acts as an arbitrator and can stop the Commission and halt an implementing measure. Parliament does not have powers of equivalent rank. In the new system, such powers are now to be conferred on us."	de
Mr. President, the debate we are addressing today is extraordinarily important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market. In applying the principle of competition, the legal system has developed Articles 85 to 94, competition policy itself, the review of all state aid, and tax provisions that could alter competition. First, indirect tax provisions; recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, direct provisions, and most notably the Code of Good Conduct. This has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca, time passes, and it is necessary to adapt the legal system we have applied until now to new circumstances. In this regard, I observed a significant consensus in all the interventions. First, it is necessary that the design of the legal system include clear and comprehensive rules. In this area of the legal system, the existence of confusing rules, regulatory gaps, or rules that merely enshrine vague legal concepts is probably more repugnant than in others. Much more so—as is the case in the second part of this reform—when the application of the legal system is entrusted to national authorities. Third, I believe the role the Commission must play, against the temptation to create independent agencies that would distort the very essence of the Commission, to ensure uniform application by international bodies is important. Fourth and finally—and this has already been mentioned—the international legal order has changed. We saw this at the aborted Seattle Conference and we are seeing it in bilateral conferences with different regions or countries around the world. The principle of jurisdiction must now be universally applied. And we must ensure compliance with environmental and labor standards, to avoid dumping in this area, to ensure that property rights are scrupulously respected, to review state aid, which—as has been said here—in many sectors distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own country, and, ultimately, to ensure that similar conditions are applied to prevent aid and internal distortions from other countries from being transferred to the international arena through, ultimately, cheating. Mr. President, dear Commissioner, Mr. Monti, there is much to be said for Mr. Jonckheer's report on state aid to the steel industry and other sectors. First of all, the report reflects Parliament's determination to systematically reduce state aid to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market. However, many of the report's conclusions are a source of serious concern, at least within our group. For example, the fact that the level and amount of State aid per capita vary considerably across Member States demonstrates the need for such comprehensive studies. Aid stemming from selfish national interests grants unfair advantages to businesses, distorting competition and leading, from a Europe-wide perspective, to an inefficient and unprofitable distribution of scarce financial resources. Nor does the type of aid allocated make any difference.	es
Water as a human right that should be available free of charge – that sounds very good, but water isn't free, just like housing or food. Only with effective taxation instruments can we achieve better water management and greater conservation. I would also like to add that I support a tighter timetable, clarification of targets and exemption criteria for groundwater and water heavily altered by human activities, as well as the explicit mention of radioactive substances. During the debate, several speakers emphasized the importance of public information and consultation with citizens. I can only emphasize this once again. Public involvement through good information and a consultation process is crucial to our success, as is also reflected in Recital 14. I would like to say to Mr. Bowe that both he and my Scottish colleague can continue to indulge in a glass of Scotch whisky from time to time in good conscience! The Commission has concluded that the extremely small amount of water abstracted for whisky production does not require regulation. Allow me now to comment on a few areas in more detail. Limiting the discharge of pollutants into our waters must be one of the most important objectives, and I am pleased that Parliament's amendments have focused on this. The Commission supports the request to incorporate the OSPAR provisions into the text. However, we must adhere to their precise content and scope. As I have already said, the OSPAR objective and timetable are primarily political commitments. A legally binding timetable would be inconsistent with this. Nevertheless, it is necessary to ensure that Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures that will achieve the objectives set and meet the timetables. For these reasons, I welcome Amendments 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60, and 88. In contrast, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 19, whose definition of dangerous substances differs from that in OSPAR. The Commission's proposal contains a clear procedure for selecting these substances, making an additional definition unnecessary. While I agree with the content of Amendments 79 and 106, they go beyond the OSPAR provisions and therefore cannot be adopted. The Commission can, in principle, also accept Amendment 60, which calls for a timetable for the Commission's proposal regarding the emission of substances on the priority list. Amendment 59 calls for the priority list to be kept under continuous review. However, this would lead to legal uncertainty regarding the status of this list and is therefore unacceptable. The request expressed in Amendments 60 and 93 for an indicative list and a list of substances for which insufficient data are available cannot be met. Such lists would have an unclear legal status and would be incompatible with the procedure for adopting the priority list. In this context, I would like to emphasize that the OSPAR Convention in no way alters existing Community law regarding nitrate emissions from agriculture. This framework directive will therefore have no impact on the Nitrates Directive.	de
It would be a very constructive contribution to the debate now under way. Finally, in paragraph 6 of the motion for a resolution, Parliament recommends the establishment of a working group in order to ensure cohesion. I think that is just a possibility, but in that case the Commissioner responsible for the environment will obviously have to be part of the group. Let us hope that this debate will really mark a watershed. The policy pursued up to now has too often consisted of giving with one hand and taking back with the other. This is a story whose sequel will be awaited with enormous interest by many. Mr President, the demonstrators in Seattle argued that free trade is detrimental to the less developed countries, that it is purely in the selfish interests of the rich countries. However, we could look at the rate of economic progress and the rate of poverty eradication in countries like India and Tanzania during the 40 or 50 years after their independence. In that case, the theory was that protectionism and public intervention would preserve jobs and allow industry to adjust gradually and painlessly. It has not worked; poverty has reached even worse levels. Medicine may taste bitter in the short term, but opening up a country's economy to domestic and foreign competition requires optimum use of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the slightly longer term. Is this not the lesson of the European Union itself, and in particular of the single market? As Commissioner Nielson said, it is a very good example for those countries and regions that aspire to greater prosperity. However, preaching the benefits of free trade in developing countries is not enough. We must also practice what we preach, by granting ourselves access to imports from those countries. Parliament's resolution on the WTO negotiations supported a free import policy by the European Union. The removal of all remaining import barriers, tariff barriers and quotas and, just as importantly, non-tariff barriers, as Mrs Maij-Weggen pointed out in her speech, would do more than any amount of aid to ensure that developing countries achieve the economic progress that both we and they want. It is clear that the lack of coherence between development policy and trade policy undermines our development efforts and probably also undermines the political regard that developing countries have for Europe and our fine words. Mr President, over the last two days we have heard many fine words about the need to strengthen the coherence, coordination and effectiveness of the Community's and Member States' external aid programmes. There is a relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which could serve as a decisive test of the Union's ability to match words with actions. I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti-personnel landmines, which are an obstacle to many development programmes, to reconstruction after conflict, and which blight the lives of the most vulnerable people in some of the poorest parts of the world, particularly in developing countries.	it
They are growing, but in terms of GDP. Their competitiveness is increasing, but the growing wealth is not reaching everyone because the number of jobs is not increasing and the disparity in employment opportunities between the various regions persists. Commissioner, read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and give it priority, because this is the major problem facing citizens. And when you review the situation and allocate the reserves, take strategic account of employment requirements, because that is ultimately what the Structural and Cohesion Funds require. Mr President, the guidelines must be designed in such a way as to sensibly direct the programmes for the important five years from 2002 to 2006 and increase their effectiveness, so that objectives such as sustainable development and the promotion of employment, particularly for women and young people, can finally become reality and the balance between economic, social and environmental policy is maintained. Particularly important are tackling the growing problems in cities, safeguarding employment in rural areas, promoting agricultural regions, and, of course—as provided for in Article 158 of the Treaty—guaranteeing equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union, including, of course, the Greek islands, which make up half of the Union's islands. Cohesion policy must be further strengthened, because a Europe with significant disparities in the standard of living between its individual regions is neither credible nor sustainable. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened attentively and with great interest to your remarks, your occasional criticisms, and your suggestions in connection with Mrs Schroedter's report. We all, Madam Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, know the reasons, the deadlines, and the delays—I will come to them in a moment. But today we are discussing the report, which, for me and the Commission, comes at the right time, given that it concerns the 2000-2006 guidelines and we are just beginning the new regional programming phase. Mrs Schroedter, you rightly pointed out that it is essentially the responsibility of the Member States and the regions to define their own development priorities. However, because of the European Union's co-financing of programmes, it is necessary and right that Community priorities, such as those being discussed and adopted here, should also be taken into account in order to promote that Community dimension of economic and social cohesion, which many of you have emphatically emphasized. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly address the meaning and structure of the guidelines before addressing the comments or criticisms made by you, Mrs Schroedter, or indeed by you, ladies and gentlemen. With regard to the meaning and structure of the guidelines, the chairman of the committee, Mr Hatzidakis, the rapporteur, and Mrs McCarthy have pointed out that the purpose of the guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for Objectives 1, 2 and 3 of the Structural Funds, as well as their links with the Cohesion Fund. The aim is to set out the Commission's priorities, based on experience gained in implementing the programmes, and current Community policies relating to structural measures.	de
Mr President, Commissioner, perhaps we should be happy that we are already at the second reading of this directive, but I am not too enthusiastic about it because it is a poor quality directive, with many shortcomings and which will cause many problems in its implementation. First of all, I believe that this directive is excessively harsh, simplistic and reductive. Directives on water have often not been applied; governments and the Commission have often failed to impose the discipline as they should have done, however unpleasant that may be. It is not a question of establishing much more stringent legislation. In many cases, in fact, the problems concern management, the assumption of the commitments due, without transferring to the legislative body the major problems concerning the water system, the complexity of which is well known. A simplistic directive has been drawn up. Countries with navigable rivers cannot be treated in the same way as others where there is insufficient water, the land opens up into large cracks and the temperature reaches 55º and 60º in the sun. I say this because the issue is not our responsibility, but rather that of the governments and the Commission. Similarly, the problems caused by the current destruction and tragedies, such as the one in Romania, do not concern the legislative bodies, but rather the executive bodies and governments. Furthermore, it is not a directive of solidarity because it does not take into account large spaces, climatic diversity, desert or arid areas. This is how the common position was drafted. The case of water distribution channels is similar. Talking about these channels means talking about the distribution of wealth, solidarity between peoples and between territories, because the earth, unfortunately, is not perfect and some areas have less than others. Finally, I strongly criticize the fact that the directive is not accompanied by an impact study. It is very easy for us to ask others to carry out an impact assessment. In environmental matters, however, we should be the ones to see how many people, how many farmers could be ruined by bearing the costs. Studies have been carried out that no one has read. I therefore believe it is a duty to establish as good political practice the carrying out of impact studies. Otherwise, we would remain just a theory. Mr President, by consolidating existing directives, this framework directive establishes the fundamental principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union. It is a framework directive on the protection and management of our waters - surface water, groundwater, transitional waters and coastal waters - through the establishment of river basin districts at national level or, in the case of Ireland, at cross-border level. Ireland fully supports the common position and many of the European Parliament's amendments. We do not believe it is acceptable, for example, to wait 25 years for legislation. We have no difficulty in accepting the principle of 'polluter pays' in relation to the recovery of costs on industrial, commercial and agricultural water use. However, I am absolutely convinced that, given that water is life and that drinking clean water is a fundamental human right, this directive must provide for the free provision of a certain quantity of water in homes, a certain quota per household for domestic and sanitary purposes.	it
This is the way to successfully manage change and I hope that the Commission will act in this direction. Finally, faced with the emergence, the resurgence of the xenophobic right in the Union, I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to implement Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination and Article 137 to combat exclusion. It is absolutely urgent that we move forward on these issues. Aspirations are a good thing, Mr Prodi; we want aspirations to be followed by action. Madam President, I hope that it is a good omen that I can conclude by making a personal statement! Mr Prodi, in your reform plans you are particularly interested in implementing a forward-looking employment policy on a European scale. For the economic sector I deal with, fisheries, this means, however, a change of direction. We must achieve this by abandoning the subsidy system typical of the planned economy and moving towards a liberal policy that promotes individual responsibility. We must reduce protective duties in order to ensure effective relief for companies in the processing industry. At stake is nothing less than the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the preservation of thousands of jobs in the processing and deep-sea fishing industries. It is certainly superfluous for me to remind you of the importance of this economic sector, which is a key factor not only from the point of view of the national economy but also from the point of view of society, and not only in Germany but also transnationally in all coastal regions of Europe. Furthermore, this economic sector is one of the few that is fully integrated at European level in terms of decision-making and operational powers. We therefore call for the right of co-decision to be exercised in this area too, as is now unanimously desired. However, the revision of fisheries policy is now imminent: it is due within a few months, i.e. at the beginning of the year 2000. It is therefore all the more disappointing that there is no mention of this sector in this programme document. I hope that this is simply an oversight! Mr Prodi, I urge you to keep your promises and implement them! Madam President, many speakers from the Group of the Party of European Socialists have already identified key areas where there are shortcomings in the Commission's declaration. However, we have acknowledged that this is an initiative by the Commission which we consider to be innovative and which we very much welcome. I would like to focus on one aspect, in addition to those already mentioned: cultural diversity in Europe. In the introduction to the declaration, in the section on quality of life, the importance of this is recognised, but the declaration makes no mention whatsoever of the Commission's intention to take action on cultural diversity. If we want to be sure of defeating the merchants of fear - those who seek power by exploiting the anxieties of citizens - we must address the question of how to organise coexistence and how to dispel the negative stereotypes that we attach to each other, within the current borders of the European Union as well as between the candidate countries and, even more so, between those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come to live and work in Europe.	it
The Commission believes that foreign policy can be successful as long as it is known exactly who is holding the reins. And who is holding them? The Commission as a whole, its President, the Council? The new European direction requires strong institutions, you say, while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks. We fully agree with the latter. It is time for the institutions to focus on truly cross-border problems and stop dressing up the European wagon with powers taken away from national authorities. Community values are mentioned several times in the text. Unfortunately, no mention of the corresponding standards is missed. The question arises of where standards and values come from. I am convinced that the Bible, the word of God, is the only pure source of good standards and true values. In the tradition of our part of the world, this concept is an important element that deserves recognition. Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr. Prodi and the Commission on their government statement. I very much appreciated the main thrusts of it. I also share Mr. Prodi's and the Commission's view that there are several areas where more Europe and greater integration are needed. Areas such as security, the World Trade Conference, food security, and also the new economy, which require greater action from the European Commission. The challenge will be how to bring the Member States, the Council, the European Parliament, national parliaments, the Commission, and a range of other stakeholders together. The European Commission will have to play a key leadership role in this regard, but this presupposes clear and achievable objectives. Clearer priorities, specific targets, and, above all, communication with society about what we are doing. These are the key actions, and that, taking into account subsidiarity, requires concrete measures from the Commission, which we would like to see included in the next program. The emphasis on core competences is something positive in itself, and I am also pleased that the Commission wants to take on a better and greater role in policy design and the adoption of political initiatives. But it is also about implementing and putting the Commission's objectives into practice. For example, if we consider the telecommunications sector, it is clear that many directives have been adopted, but we still have 15 partial markets, and the 15 Member States continue to implement these directives differently. In implementing the directives, the Commission must ensure that the political will is also translated into practice. With regard to foreign policy, Madam President, I am very pleased with the aspiration for the European Union to have both political and economic weight on the world stage. But then I ask myself: from the moment we talk about a genuine Community policy, a system for crisis prevention and crisis management at the Community level, where are the concrete proposals?	es
The private sector should be more involved, bringing the perspective of financial reality into the financing equation. It is also important to avoid projects being financed that are revenue-based and small-scale, which are difficult to monitor, and to prioritize large-scale schemes whose impacts are, in most cases, visible to all. This will reduce the constantly stressed need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to use the local tax base unnecessarily in the long term in areas where these projects are located, and the European Parliament will demonstrate the importance it attaches to the need for such reform. If Parliament supports these amendments to the report today, I believe they will take us to the next phase in pursuing the historic objectives for which these funds were created, namely financially sustainable aid to the deprived regions of the European Union, which we must bring to a decent standard of living, not by giving them a handout but by stimulating them. I call on Parliament to support these amendments. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report, as it was a difficult and serious undertaking. There is no doubt that the European Union's structural policies and cohesion policy are the basic tools for creating the conditions for development and reducing economic and social inequalities in the regions. Despite the progress that has been made, these regions still have high rates and, in terms of unemployment, unacceptable levels. To better achieve the objectives of these policies, it is essential to coordinate and organize them on the basis of well-developed, or, I would say, astute, guidelines. Let us not forget that these policies, when they are effective, become tangible for the European citizen who benefits from them, who directly notices the improvement in his or her quality of life. Let us also not forget that special importance must be given to the remote and island regions of the European Union because they suffer from fundamental handicaps in their economic and social development due to their geographical position. Unless, of course, the Commission intends to connect them to the European continent by bridges or tunnels under the sea! In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that structural policies, as a whole, require greater flexibility to adapt to developments and thus respond to the new challenges and opportunities that are emerging with the advent of a new millennium, for which we all wish the best. Mr President, there is no doubt that Mrs Schroedter's report contains many important observations, and I congratulate her on them. However, I believe that we should be even more concerned about the direction and results of the Community's regional policy. To sum up, the massive, appalling unemployment, far from diminishing, is getting worse under structural policy. The economy and agricultural areas are irremediably affected by the regional policy being pursued, with dramatic consequences for rural employment and the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South.	fr
"The Commission fully supports the efforts being made in this regard, and is currently considering whether specific measures can be taken in the environmental field. I must, of course, express my appreciation for the role played here by the Parliamentary Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, and in particular its Chair. Allow me to point out that, when the members of the current Commission were sworn in, each one, one after the other, was questioned by the Committee on Women's Rights on how they intended to work for gender equality in their particular field of activity. We intend to closely monitor the activity of each Commissioner, and I therefore wanted to warn the other Commissioners in this regard as well. Thank you for your reply! I actually draw the conclusion that you agree with the need for an action plan—an action plan aimed at involving more women in work in specific environmental areas. Let me also say that the Beijing Declaration underlined the importance of having the institutional capacity to integrate the gender perspective into any environmental programme. Institutions in this field often lack the knowledge and procedures necessary to integrate such a perspective into their daily work. I would obviously like to know whether the Commissioner is prepared to include this idea of equality in environmental policy and the programmes that flow from it. This is an important question. If we want our entire policy to be marked by this concern for gender balance, I think it is essential that senior officials have the necessary basic knowledge. (SV) I, of course, see mainstreaming as a principle that must apply to all our work. Gender issues play a very important role in the project that is being developed in my department. I am also prepared to make a personal commitment, for example by leading seminars on management responsibilities, or on other subjects, to encourage women to take on new missions within the Commission. If we want to motivate all female officials, I think it is very important that this message is conveyed at all levels, from top to bottom or from bottom to top, as preferred. It seems to me that environmental work, in general, is often dominated by women. This is a trend that should be continued, so that women too can obtain positions of responsibility or rise in the hierarchy of bodies working on the environment. I affirm that our action plan reflects this desire, but it could certainly be improved. I have some experience in the field of project implementation and monitoring. I hope that it can be useful. Question No. 43 of (H-0045/00): Subject: Boyne Estuary and Drogheda Harbour Under the Wild Birds Directive, the Boyne Estuary has been designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) and, because of its international importance, there is currently talk, under the Habitats Directive, of making it a Special Area of Conservation. However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and the commercial company ""Drogheda Corporation"" have allowed the construction of a new harbour in the SPA and even the removal of a mudflat at Stegrennan, an area recently added to the SPA, especially at the insistence of the Commission."	fr
"We are obviously waiting for this reform from the Commission, we are waiting for the proposals that the Commission will make to us, and this Parliament will have to rule on them. In the meantime, we must give the Commission a vote of confidence. ""Verbose."" I am not going to mention the length of this report. I don't know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but it certainly breaks the record for this type of resolution without a doubt. I don't think there has ever been a resolution before—and look, in this Parliament we make complex resolutions—that has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single period. Furthermore, it is ""confusing."" I am not going to go over what has been said about the analysis of issues that concern Parliament. That should be the subject of another report, and we will have to do so, and we need to reflect on it, but not in this report. And finally, frankly, Mr. President, I am not going to give examples, but there are many in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of precision. Therefore—and I summarize—I await, Commissioner Kinnock, your report—many of us await it—so that we can truly speak out in its favor, which is what Parliament must do. Mr. President, the scope and thoroughness of the proposals for necessary reform measures allow us to deduce the importance of such reform. In light of the events that these efforts have brought about, the need becomes particularly evident. Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock raised even more hopes and expectations with their emphatic statements. The concept of transparency is particularly striking in the report. Ensuring this is one of our main desires. The importance of auditable work cannot be overemphasized. But this is not just a question of bureaucratic reform, but rather a demonstration of goodwill toward the public. Their confidence in EU policy must be restored. The public wishes to exercise their right to rapid and open access to the institution and to understand its provisions. He draws his understanding from them and seeks a results-driven policy that he conceives as a service to an adult citizen, the provision of which goes without saying. The success of the reform depends essentially on the Commission's own initiative. However, I am annoyed to hear today that the Commission now says it wants to discuss the interim report with Parliament only informally. Your intervention, Mr. Kinnock, in the Committee on Budgetary Control next Tuesday should not be a one-way street; rather, we as parliamentarians want and must cooperate. It also conflicts with my idea of policy that a press conference is being held this week before we have discussed the report in detail in the Committee on Parliamentary Control. Mr. Kinnock, I believe that, despite all your personal successes, the Commission must do more to meet our justifiably ambitious expectations. (EN) I would like to begin, for the record and to enlighten Mrs Langenhagen, by saying that the decision that I will not appear before the House tomorrow and therefore will not be available to give formal replies on the report was not my decision nor that of the Commission - it was a decision of this Parliament!"	es
This is a view I firmly reject because competition is for citizens and citizens alone. Most businesses hate competition. Competition is implemented and managed in the interests of citizens, in their economic interest and for their freedom. The examples of liberalization and competition in air transport and telephone services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this. I can only repeat that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all these concerns in a more competent and detailed manner next Monday in the appropriate committee. Thank you very much, Commissioner. I have received a motion for a resolution1, pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure, to close this debate. The debate is closed. We will now proceed to the vote. (Parliament adopts the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE We voted in favor of the resolution because this request was made to us by a union at the French postal service, which hoped, in the event of a positive vote, to obtain additional time to be able to defend its employees. This does not mean that we approve of all the content, which is too vague and leaves out the substance. The policy pursued by the European institutions and by national governments, particularly the French, is a retrograde policy, contrary to the interests of both users, that is to say the vast majority of the population, and those of postal workers. Postal services must remain public services. Everyone, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to them on the same basis and under the same conditions. Any idea of profitability must be excluded when it comes to organizing the public service, and private companies must not be allowed to reap private profit by monopolizing the most beneficial activities of the public service. It follows that the Post Office and its equivalents in the various European countries should retain a monopoly on this service. To ensure adequate postal services across the European Union, it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing local post offices, reducing the number of rounds and overworking staff. On the contrary, the Post Office and, more generally, all public services must hire additional staff. The usefulness of these jobs is undeniable, and creating a sufficient number would reduce unemployment in Europe. Mr President, I personally voted for this resolution because we absolutely must debate the postal service in the European Parliament and put an end to the current ambiguity. If we dismantle the public service, it will be very serious, and we want to know the Commission's intentions. When we are told that we will serve customers better and at a lower cost, this is obviously false. People who live far from everything will obviously not be served or will have to pay a lot, and some of them will not be able to afford it.	fr
"To increase the employment rate and finance social security systems, we need to work longer throughout our lives, and above all, have more women working with greater knowledge. Therefore, we hope that this Lisbon Summit will contribute to changing the current paradigm of female employment. I would like to ask you, Mr. President, if you anticipate that this Summit will produce conclusions that will allow for the adoption of concrete, time-bound measures so as to ensure that there are not only more women in the world of work, but also, and above all, in the new knowledge economy. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for the significant and excellent contributions you have made during this debate to the preparation of our Extraordinary Lisbon Summit. I believe this debate was necessary, and that Parliament's participation was also necessary, because I believe that Europe still lacks a strategic direction, and for that strategic direction to be possible, an institutional alliance is necessary that overcomes the natural political divergences. Furthermore, this alliance is already fully embodied in the excellent cooperation that the Commission, led by Romano Prodi, and its document have just provided for the preparation of the Lisbon Summit. But it is also important for Parliament to play an essential role. I would like for us, at the Lisbon Summit, in addition to agreeing on a strategy, to be able to formulate a set of concrete measures and a method of coordination. I would like to give two examples, linked, moreover, to the much-discussed discussion here about concrete measures that I would like to see approved: one of them is that by 2002 all schools and training centers in Europe will be connected to the Internet and simultaneously have adequate staff to provide the essential training so that young people leaving primary school and all those in vocational training, unemployed or not, can acquire, as it were, a ""driver's license"" for the information society that will allow them to operate computers and surf the Internet. If this is the case, we will be creating the conditions so that information technologies are not a factor of social rupture, of widening the gap between those who succeed and those who fail, but, on the contrary, an important vector of integration, an important vector in the fight against exclusion. Second example: we have talked about women's participation in the labor market and equal opportunities between women and men in society in general. Concrete measures that relate to what I recently said regarding a common objective of support services for families, and in particular for children, are a decisive factor in creating jobs and simultaneously equal opportunities and much greater participation of women in the labor market. Concrete measures, yes, but also a method of coordination that will allow us, in the various dimensions mentioned here, to have the European institutions and governments adopt common action programs and have quantifiable and verifiable instruments for this coordination."	es
We must thank those who, despite their helplessness and lack of resources, have courageously fought against the grave effects of this disaster on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem, and Europe's fishing resources. Mr. President, in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I would like to congratulate the Commission, and especially Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, for their reaction to this event, which has truly shaken the whole of Europe. In the Committee on Transport, I must say, we are ready to debate the Commission's communication on maritime safety and, of course, we are also prepared to subsequently debate the legal implications arising from the examination of this communication. That said, I would like to make a few observations: First, the Commission was right to focus its investigation on the responsibilities of the Italian classification society RINA, because we must verify whether it applied Community law. That is where our efforts must begin. Second, in addition to the shipowners' responsibilities, in cases like this, it would be good to also clarify the responsibilities of charterers; of oil companies, for example, which also bear responsibility for triggering ecological disasters like this, and, of course, for repairing the damage. From this perspective, the reaction to the ecological disaster is entirely justified. However, it should not lead us to blame the merchant marine as a whole, which is a very important sector for the economy, given that it covers approximately one-third of all transport operations. Therefore, our reactions must be measured; severe, but balanced. I am not at all opposed to considering amending Community law to make it more stringent, but, as other colleagues have pointed out, we must begin by applying it, because a legal framework already exists—and this is something we must never forget—within the European Union. This is a fairly advanced legal framework—at least compared to what is happening in the rest of the world—and, consequently, Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, must undertake the effort to truly apply Community law. Mr. President, Commissioner, I believe that the regrettable Erika incident should, indeed, as has been said here this afternoon, be the definitive turning point that marks the before and after of this type of accident in the European Union, where, since 1967, there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers, more than one every two years. The social and economic damage, which has already been discussed here today, in terms of both job losses and loss of fishing and tourism resources, is of such magnitude that it amply justifies decisive and forceful action on the part of the Community institutions. I too, Commissioner, would like to thank you for your department's swift response to this incident and for the measures that are already being taken and are underway. And I trust that these measures will lead, in a few months, to a clear and forceful legal instrument—possibly a directive—that will once and for all put an end to these 21st-century pirates, who are robbing us all of the richness and beauty of the sea.	es
Moreover, the agreements concluded with the EU will lead to an anchoring. They will irrevocably fix economic reforms, just as each party's commitments under the agreements will stabilize domestic and economic reforms. The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that combining free trade policies with social development policies will lead to economic growth and a reduction in poverty. Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU's trade regime for all less developed countries, 39 of which are in fact part of the ACP group. This process will take place over the next five years, so that by 2005, essentially all products from developing country exporters will have free access to the EU market. Regarding the volume of the next EDF, the EU has made a financial proposal. It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial level of financial resources in a period when official development aid budgets are limited with the need to increase the effectiveness of Community aid. Currently, approximately €9.5 billion of previous EDF resources remain uncommitted. The EU is committed to mobilizing these remaining balances, in addition to the new EDF resources, over a period of seven years, i.e., before the next Financial Protocol enters into force. This will enable the Community to substantially increase the annual flow of commitments and payments during this period. We are therefore not heading towards a period of reduced activity in the coming years, but rather towards a period of increased activity. Such a commitment implies a thorough reform of the procedures and implementing arrangements on both sides. There is a very real link between the reform process within the Commission itself and our ability to deliver on the ground, which forms the basis of the agreement with the ACP countries. I come to our development policy. I would say that the global context has changed completely. The marginalization of many economies, increased poverty around the world, the need for better management of environmental interdependence, the destabilizing effects of migration, and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemics are all major concerns. It is in this changing global context that we must situate ourselves. Fortunately, EU aid evaluations offer us a valuable tool to improve our actions and, hopefully, also to address the challenges I have just mentioned. Regarding the specific contribution of these evaluations, I would mention the following problems: the drawbacks of Community policy are too numerous and too vague, and this undermines coherence. This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to the real inconsistencies that exist between policies and sectoral interests within the Member States. The Commission's aid regime is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures, and institutional mechanisms. Policies are often determined more by the available instruments than by clearly defined policy objectives and priorities. Human resources are too weak compared to the volume of aid we are expected to manage.	fr
But we have the impression that this growth, fueled first by the performance of the United States, then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general course of the world, even despite our handicaps. We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be urgently remedied: structural rigidities, excessive compulsory levies. But let us not forget that another, new one has just been added with the single currency. Indeed, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies impose additional rigidities on the different countries of the eurozone by imposing on them behaviors that are not necessarily adapted to their respective structures and circumstances. This unification is considered positive by the Commission report. But, in reality, we cannot rule out the possibility that it will lead to a suboptimal overall situation. If we add to this the strangeness of a single currency that is not backed by a state, itself backed by a people, we can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels: the markets' distrust of the euro. It is true that the weakness of the single currency may have been initially welcomed in 1999, since it unexpectedly promoted growth, but we cannot forever hide the fact that it is in reality a symptom of bad policies and poor operating conditions. Mr President, this draft resolution is contested, which is hardly surprising given the subject matter. Economists are not so unanimous, especially when it comes to the future. The rapporteur's carefree plea for greater economic growth seems like an attractive way to combat high unemployment. But in reality, it is short-term politics. He also advocates stable growth, but that has nothing to do with stability. Given ecological and demographic developments, we should be encouraging member states to pursue selective economic growth. Increased investment, production, and consumption only bring short-term prosperity. Consumption of scarce raw materials and energy must be significantly reduced. Other priorities include paying off high government debts and restructuring pension systems. If member states do nothing in this regard, there will be even less money for healthcare, education, and other important public services in the future. A plea for more active public management is particularly welcome. The latest Eurostat reports on rising inflation, which currently stands at 2 percent (the maximum permitted value), are not being taken into account. Anyone who nevertheless wants higher government spending will hardly have to wait for the European Central Bank's next interest rate increase. The jobs that the authorities can create are therefore being wiped out due to the unfavorable developments, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. The high unemployment rate in the European Union worries us all, especially since the downward trend does not seem to be continuing.	fr
"I truly believe that the preferred option is to find a peaceful solution for Cyprus and allow it to join the European Union. Mr. President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in the opinion of the Communist Party of Greece, Cyprus's main problem is not its accession to the European Union, but the 26-year-long occupation of 40% of Cypriot territory by Turkey. The future of the Cypriot people lies in the unity of this small country, regardless of the ethnic origin of each Cypriot. The only acceptable and viable solution, which leaves no room for foreign intervention like that which has caused all the problems of the past fifty years, is a united and federal Cyprus, as envisaged by UN Security Council resolutions. The key to resolving the Cyprus problem lies with the Turkish government, which supports and encourages the intransigent stance of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash. The European Union, with its supposed interest in freedom and human rights, has never been moved, neither by the tragedy of the Cypriot people, nor by the problem of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot refugees, nor by the forced demographic change in Northern Cyprus, nor by the massive settlement of Turks in the occupied territories. Even in this very hall, the Council representative spoke of the northern part of Cyprus, not the occupied territories. The recent Helsinki decision to grant Turkey accession status without making the slightest concession regarding the occupation of Cyprus, for example, by reducing its military presence there or returning Ammochostos, has given Turkey unprecedented encouragement to persist in its uncompromising position. It is no coincidence that Turkish Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit declared immediately after Helsinki that the Cyprus problem had already been resolved in 1974. This support for Turkey's rigid stance certainly does not contribute to the rapprochement of the two communities in the direct talks under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General. The people of Cyprus have already lost much on their path to accession, and they will lose even more. The adoption of the acquis communautaire has caused considerable problems for the Cypriot economy, particularly agriculture. It requires the sell-off of the public sector, and it deregulates and destroys the country's developed system of social solidarity. Mr. President, forgive me, but the French cabinet just made a small translation error in Mr. Alyssandrakis's contribution, specifically in the most sensitive phrase of the entire debate. I do not want there to be any misunderstanding here. In the French translation, Mr. Alyssandrakis is said to have said, ""the confederal solution is the best."" However, Mr. Alyssandrakis clearly stated, ""the federal solution is the best."" This clarification is extremely important, Mr. President. Thank you for the clarification, Mr. Wurtz. Mr. President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries on the European mainland. The Maltese people, for example, have done an excellent job of surviving in an unfavorable geographical and geopolitical environment. Their success is largely due to their entrepreneurial spirit, dynamism, and flexibility. Malta boasts successful light and heavy manufacturing, a burgeoning financial services sector, a productive agricultural sector, a thriving tourism industry, and a wide range of employment opportunities—all this despite the fact that Malta has virtually no natural resources."	de
Regarding the parliamentary process, I would like to reiterate my thanks to everyone, especially the rapporteur, who acted and intervened because most of Parliament's amendments were incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council, in this case almost all of them, although with some modifications, and because, in addition, the first offer in terms of funds was improved. It was improved by providing fresh money, as we discussed at the time, and this was achieved while safeguarding Parliament's prerogatives and powers. As for the Commission, in this interinstitutional game, I think that this is always important and I am happy to emphasize this. I would like to thank once again all those who have spoken, especially Vice-President Provan, for his wonderful participation throughout this debate, especially during the conciliation procedure, the chairman of the Committee on Industry and also, in particular, Mrs Ahern and all the Members who have participated in this work. Thank you, Commissioner. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. CULTURE 2000 The next item is the report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation (Culture 2000 Programme) (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD)). Madam President, I really think we should not have debated this any further because we already said everything in the last debate. Unfortunately, nothing has changed the fact that the Council constantly discusses culture but does not spend any money on culture. We have the feeling, indeed the conviction, that the Member States would be delighted to be able to erase what they included in the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. Because - let's be clear - no one really wants to spend money on culture. Unfortunately, that's just how it is. We have to acknowledge that. I would like to thank the rapporteur who tirelessly tried to clear this file, in cooperation, of course, with the Commissioner. Well, we had to acknowledge the fact that, while we had achieved our objective in substance, this was naturally not the case in financial terms. In such a negotiation, which should, frankly, engender unanimity, we then find ourselves helpless. The mess that is taking place is truly unfair. There are always people who can refuse everything, and on the other side, we stand here begging for some extra money for culture. What we are doing here is truly dishonorable. It is a terrible souk where relations are unequal. We are nevertheless delighted that this program has become what we wanted it to be. It corresponds to what citizens expect from us. We support small and medium-sized events, not large ones; we offer easier access to citizens and smaller actors.	fr
I therefore propose that this House approve at third reading the proposals relating to the SAVE programme and the conclusion reached in the conciliation procedure. I would like to remind the House that Parliament adopted at second reading this report, which contained eight amendments, including the restoration of the Commission's original budget. The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments, including the one relating to the budgetary allocation, and I thank the Commission for its continued support for the budget during the conciliation procedure, because what the Council proposed was unacceptable. The procedure resulted in agreement on the studies and actions aimed at developing, implementing, complementing, and evaluating Community measures. Compromise texts were achieved for five other amendments, including the mention of legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and, very importantly, energy audit systems in the monitoring of energy efficiency progress. I hope you will all recognize that this is a significant achievement. Parliament stoically defended the issue of the financial envelope in the face of the Council's very meager initial offer. The truth is that several meetings were necessary until the Council finally agreed to a substantial increase in the envelope. We achieved an increase of €2 million over the initial amount, which is a decisive increase that I can recommend to the House and with which the Commission has confirmed that it can implement the programs. This was an important consideration for us. However, I would like to say that it is and always has been a very modest budget, and therefore the funding for this program is more symbolic than real. Funding for energy savings still depends primarily on the Member States. We must bear this in mind when we approve this program. It is a shame that what we can achieve at the Community level is more symbolic than real, because there is great enthusiasm at the local level for measures, including Community measures, aimed at energy savings. The Community can intervene by connecting local activists with each other to prevent them from trying to reinvent the wheel in each region. We must play an important role in the European Union Community in this regard. SAVE is the only Community-wide program designed to promote rational energy consumption. It focuses on non-technical elements that help build energy-efficient infrastructure, and the program's purpose is to create an environment that encourages investment and energy efficiency. In this regard, we must recognize that there is also a market opportunity for the energy-saving sector. We have heard a lot about competition problems in the field of renewable energy, but energy efficiency will allow companies to save money; in fact, it saves everyone money and therefore shouldn't be a problem. It's something we can all support. I must say that, like motherhood, despite the fact that we all support it, sometimes we do very little to substantially and concretely help mothers or those dedicated to energy saving. We could do much more, considering that we have made major commitments to reducing CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as reducing dependence on energy imports.	es
A second conciliation allowed an increase of EUR 1.1 million to arrive at this compromise of EUR 77 million. Despite an increase of EUR 3 million compared to the initial proposal, I personally regret once again that the financial resources are not up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern for savings expressed by the Council in this situation contrasts too much with its declarations in favour of security of energy supply, job creation and environmental protection - all challenges that must be met. Renewable energy is an indisputable means of achieving these objectives. However, despite the reservations I express about the inadequacy of the financial allocation, I personally support the compromise, given the content of the programme to which the European Parliament has made an active contribution because, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, this area falls under the codecision procedure. It is almost a given that, with the series of measures and actions proposed, we should come close to the target of 12% of renewable energy by 2010, or a doubling if the credits as a whole, including those from the State, continue to exist. Together with SAVE II and the integration of the environmental dimension into energy policy, this programme therefore lays the foundations for a genuine Community strategy aimed at ensuring clean energy while reducing dependence. In conclusion, Mr President, I would also like to insist that, in addition to the measures proposed, there should also be legislative measures and, above all, adequate budgets to give effect to this political will. I will of course end by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, as well as the members of the committee and the conciliation committee. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to express my satisfaction at the agreement reached on the ALTENER II programme in the conciliation committee. I would like to join the various speakers in saying that this agreement will soon allow the ALTENER programme to be included in the Energy Framework Programme. This will lead to greater coordination, transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes, which will soon include the SAVE programme, which we will be discussing shortly. Parliament has done a great deal of good work during this period; in this respect, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, and all those who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary. Of course, there were discussions and conciliation was necessary, as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron have said; the first meeting had not produced any results and it was necessary to meet again, even though the sums involved were not large. I believe, however, that in the end a reasonable agreement was reached which, like others, despite the imperfections, allows us to move forward with the projects under consideration. I would once again like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on the work he has done; I would like to thank all the speakers and would like to highlight the effective work of Vice-President Provan during the conciliation, which enabled us to achieve a positive result.	it
The European Union is currently discussing aspects on which it hopes China will take concrete action. On the basis of these debates, the Presidency will convey to the Chinese authorities that the European Union expects China to announce positive steps at the meeting on 25 February. The Presidency will also submit to the Chinese authorities a list of specific cases on which it intends to express its deep concern. The meeting held in Beijing in October 1999 confirmed, on the one hand, that the Chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues related to the dialogue proper, the reform of the dialogue, and the debate on legal norms of law enforcement (death penalty, administrative detention). On the other hand, however, they will not give in on fundamental issues relating to the single-party system and territorial integrity. The debates within the European Union on the situation in China, following the outcome of the 1999 rounds of dialogue, led the European Union to express emphatically its concern about human rights violations in China and the lack of concrete results from the dialogue, while also recognizing the positive steps China has taken internationally. The European Union has expressed its dissatisfaction with the outcome of the dialogue on several occasions to the Chinese authorities and assured them that it expected better results in certain highly sensitive areas. It was decided that the dialogue should continue, but in a more targeted and effective manner, with China accepting the European Union's proposal to restructure the dialogue through better use of experts and closer ties with the seminars. Last but not least, the Commission on Human Rights will also address the rationalization of its own work at its next session. A working group is reviewing the Commission's mechanisms. It has worked intensively and is unanimous in its view that it is essential to increase the efficiency of existing mechanisms and to give them greater enforcement power, particularly in the financial field. The European Union will oppose any unfair attempt to deprive the Commission on Human Rights of its intervention capabilities by redirecting its activities, minimizing its scope and its constant attention to all matters relating to human rights around the world. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Presidency for the work it has done in preparing for the next session in Geneva on the issues of racism, civil rights, political rights, and the right to development. As the President-in-Office of the Council has said, much work still lies ahead, although the call by Parliament and many NGOs for the European Union to clarify its position well in advance of the Geneva session is entirely understandable. This is easier said than done—we are still debating some of the most difficult issues. For example, many of the points contained in Parliament's resolution are still being discussed, and it is still too early to predict the outcomes in individual areas. It is not surprising that this debate has been lengthy and difficult.	de
In this context, the European Union must consider – and it began to do so at the beginning of this week – how its neighboring country, Yugoslavia, can, despite everything, be included in regional cooperation, without withdrawing any of its criticism of that terrible regime. Therefore, I shall table an amendment tomorrow advocating that sanctions be concentrated on the regime, while at the same time providing certain relief for the population and also for the economy in the spirit of economic cooperation. In this regard, I am grateful – I may mention this here, as I come from a country through which the Danube flows – for the considerations being put forward by the Commission, namely Commissioner Patten, but also Vice-President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, to make the Danube navigable again in order to facilitate a modicum of economic recovery in this region as well, which would, of course, be particularly important for Romania. I believe that this regional approach, if properly understood, namely as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is the right path. As I said, it must not be perceived as coercion, nor should it be set as a precondition. Secondly, I want to state quite clearly that we want FYROM/Macedonia to have the path to the European Union open and offered to it. We consider it an illusion to believe that it would make sense to apply for membership now, but we also consider it wrong to think that we will discuss this sometime later. Macedonia/FYROM now wants the answer that, in principle, it will have this opportunity when the time comes. The country fears being sidelined, so to speak. It sees the entire restructuring of the funding instruments as a danger of no longer being the last carriage on a train heading towards Europe, but rather of this train continuing to move within Europe, and of it ending up on a side track. But I believe Commissioner Patten understands this as well. I urge him with all my might to make this clear in the relevant discussions. Thirdly, I believe Macedonia/FYROM has demonstrated—so far, at least—that it is capable of handling the instruments effectively. Even if there are, of course, adjustments here, Macedonia/FYROM will continue to demonstrate that many of the tasks currently being handled in Brussels can in the future be developed in Skopje, in the country itself. I hope that my colleagues can agree that we accept these requests as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM/Macedonia. Mr. President, since the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia—I prefer to use this abbreviation—has played a constructive and peacekeeping role. We recall the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina at that time, which aimed at a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure. Our Macedonian friends have therefore always played a very positive role. For this reason, it must be stated here that Macedonia is not simply the subject, but rather the source, of our so-called stabilization efforts.	de
We might really ask ourselves, dear colleagues, why 76% of Belgian citizens have no confidence in their country's justice system, 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country's justice system, 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in their justice system... (The President cuts off the speaker) Madam President, my group, the EDD, and my party in particular, is very concerned about this debate. We cannot in any way support, and we do not support, Mr. Haider's opinions and policies, and we deplore his references to the Third Reich. However, we also regret that your Parliament would consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country, especially when that country is part of the European Union. The party of which I am a member, in my country, is certainly not racist, but we do not readily accept the laws and interference of the European Union. Will you stand in the way of the British Parliament if we are elected? Madam President, the citizens of Austria have decided to elect Mr. Haider to their parliament. I believe he received 28% of the vote, so Germany will have a coalition government. Let me say that your Parliament, Madam President, should wait and see whether Mr. Haider's party influences the policies of this country. Then, and only then, can you ask yourself whether human rights are being affected. Your Parliament can consider appropriate measures to counter this situation, and then, Madam President, and only then, can your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a European Union country. Madam President, as a member of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns of some colleagues about democratic developments in Austria. You may be surprised by my reaction if I say that I personally cannot understand the exacerbated reaction against Austria, which questions its respect for human rights, its ability to come to terms with its past, and the stability of democracy. Austria must accept the often dubious image it is given, rightly or wrongly, abroad. For years, the refusal of our governments to admit our share of guilt in the horrors of the Second World War and to provide fair compensation to Jewish victims and forced laborers has contributed significantly to this negative image. Now, on the basis of the results of the elections of October 3, 1999, which punished the former government, the FPÖ has committed itself to a coalition government with the ÖVP. This is the right of the citizens of a state because it is the fundamental principle of a democracy. After the failure of talks between the SPÖ and the ÖVP, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and sought the support of the FPÖ. You only have to read the newspapers: three ministerial posts were offered to the very party whose fascist tendencies are being denounced here. When we declined this offer, inflammatory propaganda, which we still do not understand, suddenly erupted.	fr
In particular, it is in the area of trade and agricultural policy that the inconsistency with development policy is most evident. We are unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries, and this is because there are differences of opinion among the Member States of the Union on development cooperation. We must no longer consider development cooperation as an instrument of external relations and foreign policy, but as a policy in its own right. I appeal for a development policy that is transparent, supportive and efficient. As long as the European approach to the problem of development creates greater inefficiency and greater waste of money, it seems advisable to leave more room for action by the Member States. Finally, I ask the Commission to send the document I mentioned earlier to the European Parliament as soon as possible, so that we too can reflect constructively on possible solutions. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think this is a timely and very sensible initiative. English: As several colleagues have already said, we often find ourselves faced with a major contradiction between what, on the one hand, we would like to do with development and cooperation policy, and what, on the other, we frustrate with sectoral policies that produce the opposite effects, in terms of development, for the same countries. Not to mention the concrete impact of our common policies: tourism, environment, agriculture, fisheries, industry. We can generally speak - and this is even more serious - of contradictions between our economic and trade policies and those in the field of defence. In short, there is a set of contradictory situations. In my opinion, the contradictions are not so serious in terms of community policies, but rather in relation to certain objectives and industrial sectors of some Member States. We must be aware of this. On the one hand, we often adopt resolutions in peace processes in other parts of the world, as happened recently with Indonesia, which cries out for vengeance, and then on the other hand we discover that some European countries were suppliers of weapons and war material. These are, in my opinion, the most serious contradictions in this whole matter, more serious than those, which do exist, due to an incompatibility between sectoral policies. We know, of course, that even within a single country there are always contradictions between the various policies. This is normal. We must therefore be aware of the fact that, even at the level of the European Union, there may be contradictions between the various common policies, in this case in the field of development policy. We must be aware of the existence of these contradictions and of the fact that they must be reduced to a minimum: this is the right and wise objective from which the resolution under consideration is based. I consider the idea of creating an observatory to monitor the evolution of the coherence between Community policies and cooperation and development policy to be very wise and appropriate, the scope of which must not be limited to Community policies, but also include the actions or policies of the Member States, including - I think it is important - the actions of economic groups.	it
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that the rules must be observed, as does the requirement that our partners also observe them. We are understandably concerned about this today, but I do not want our request to be understood as selective. Nor do I want our oral question to be seen as an accusation. Since our request is not selective, the Commission must also feel called upon to address the use of Community funds in the regions neighbouring Israel. And since the question to the Commission is not and should not be viewed as an accusation, I would like to emphasize two points here that are essential for the balance of our position. Firstly, anyone who knows the region knows that the future of the Palestinian economy is closely linked to the economic cooperation agreement with Israel. The Oslo Protocol provides for customs integration that includes Israel and the Palestinian Authority. And anything that amounts to a division of the two economies would harm Israeli-Palestinian cooperation, including joint ventures, Palestinian suppliers, and exporters. Second, the borders of the State of Israel are not specified anywhere in the agreements between Israel and the European Union. Indeed, the definition of these borders is precisely what the ongoing negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are about. Any attempt by the European Union to impose its own interpretation of Israel's territoriality would, at the very least, be clumsy and detrimental to these negotiations and our vision of Europe's role in the region. I support the Commissioner's prudent approach to this matter, primarily because it is not a simple issue. It is complicated because it is always difficult to determine the origin and provenance of goods. This also applies to the Middle East, where there are numerous joint ventures and some goods are produced partly on Palestinian territory and partly in the State of Israel, and that is a good thing. These developments give us hope for the future because this type of trade in the Middle East is paving the way for a peace agreement. Precisely because this is not a simple or easily resolved issue, we must proceed cautiously and thoughtfully. The second reason why the Commission is right to act in this way and not otherwise is this: if the European Union wants to contribute to peace in the region, it must be fair and just. But it would not be fair and just to decide hastily without holding discussions and meeting with groups to hear their assessment of the situation, both with regard to the territory of the State of Israel in relation to the trade agreement and, as already mentioned, to the goods and their origin. In my opinion, there is another reason to support the Commission. The peace agreement is going through a delicate phase. The Israeli government wants peace, a secure peace, and a hasty and precipitate approach could jeopardize the success of the peace agreement. Negotiations cannot be a one-size-fits-all process; this involves a comprehensive solution to extraordinarily difficult issues, and I think the Commission is entirely right to consider these issues carefully, in the hope that in this way we can achieve what we all seek: a secure, just, and lasting peace in the Middle East.	de
"From this perspective, the events we are witnessing in Austria must be viewed as tragic. For the first time since the Second World War, an openly pro-Nazi, racist, and xenophobic party is at the gates of power in a European country. In the face of this danger, which entails the negation of the very idea of European integration, we must allow nothing to deter us—not the legal quibbles about what the treaty permits and what it doesn't, not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene, not the ridiculous respect for formal democracy, and above all, not the feeling of powerlessness that overwhelms us in the face of an event that we reject wholeheartedly, yet over which we have no influence. As a member of parliament for the French overseas department of Réunion, a melting pot whose population has been made up of Europeans, Black Africans, Malagasy, indentured workers from India and Pakistan, and even Chinese over the past three centuries, I experience every day the profound truth of Saint-Exupéry's dictum: ""If you are different from me, my brother, I am not inferior, but rather enriched."" Our greatest wealth is the diversity of humanity, and therefore I feel obliged to seek out and condemn everything that opposes it, wherever it appears. For all these reasons, I voted resolutely in favor of the resolution submitted to our House on the formation of a government in Austria. The rise of Jörg Haider through a coalition government formed between the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) and the conservative right represents the resurrection of a horrific monster in Europe, spawned by liberalism. The FPÖ's success is due both to its acceptance by the Austrian right and social democracy, and to its policies, whose disastrous social consequences paved the way for far-right populism. The resolution announces possible diplomatic measures to politically isolate the new government, but without a single word about the deeper causes of the resurgence of fascism, which stems from the despair of the populations that have fallen victim to the king's money, as well as the ruling classes' decision to rely on a strong regime in order to further intensify austerity and deregulation policies. To counter the xenophobic behavior of a trainee dictator who longs for the Third Reich, every opportunity must be used to express our solidarity with Austrian anti-fascists. Therefore, we vote against this resolution, despite its mendacious references to a ""European democratic model"" that resembles more of a fortress that persecutes, expels, and imprisons immigrants without papers, and even fingerprints young people. I have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in light of a possible coalition formation between the ÖVP and the FPÖ. I consider the elevation of Jörg Haider as ""Europe's bogeyman""—a vicious neo-Nazi and supreme racist—to be counterproductive. Of course, I do not agree at all with the published statements of this right-wing populist and strongly condemn xenophobia and any attempt to trivialize the Hitler regime. However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction in Europe to the events in Austria will multiply Haider's following."	de
However, when the corpus juris was actually launched in 1997 in San Sebastián—before a very select audience of 140 jurists, without invitation to the media—the then President of the European Parliament, Mr. Gil-Robles y Gil-Delgado, said he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU jurisdiction in criminal matters to all sectors of criminal activity. A public debate is needed on this matter. Member States and citizens of Member States must be properly informed. The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system of Ireland and the United Kingdom must be addressed. There must be much more transparency on this issue than has been the case to date. It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the EU Member States without a proper public debate. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Radical Members, I abstained from voting on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control because I share the concerns expressed, so authoritatively, by the representative of another, undoubtedly important, legal culture, common law. Undoubtedly, with this text we are forcing the issue, as we believe there are aspects that must be resolved and that it is crucial to suppress and curb EU fraud. However, the way in which our committee, with the impetus and stubbornness of its Chair, Mrs. Theato, intends to push forward with this text cannot be free from criticism. Another important criticism of the text concerns secondary law. Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to adopt the necessary measures to combat fraud. However, we are somewhat perplexed that an institution is being advocated that would represent a qualitative leap forward, without even considering its effects. That is, that the aspect of defense is being neglected, and therefore, the possibility of the prosecution and defense functioning effectively in such an important legal system. By abstaining in committee, we wished to express these perplexities. Mr. President, I believe it is necessary to reflect loudly on this issue at the headquarters of the European Parliament, in plenary and in committees, although it is clear that the debate cannot ignore the world of culture, legal culture, and the environments in which institutional matters are addressed. We are facing very serious episodes that in the past seemed to be a custom. Today, something has changed, at least in the systems, especially with regard to oversight, but we are still not satisfied, especially when, in the competent bodies, there is even talk of a European Prosecutor, of crimes, fraud, embezzlement, and the disclosure of secrets at the European level. I believe we must protect the interests of the Community and its image, as well as our relationship with taxpayers, who are an indispensable and fundamental part of the Community's life. Therefore, it is right to address the issue of protecting interests of a general and universal nature, better harmonizing with justice within the individual states.	es
The debate between the advisability of prolonging the Lomé Convention, with its quotas and protectionism, or, conversely, of gradually liquidating the special relations between the European Union and the ACP countries in the name of free trade, is a false debate between two ways of perpetuating the plunder and impoverishment of these countries. I rebel against an ignoble and inhumane organization that causes hundreds of millions of human beings to literally starve to death to enrich a minority. Even a fraction of the immense wealth accumulated by large groups would be enough to lift these countries out of poverty, but as long as we dare not blame the major capitalist groups, we will only be obscuring the real problems. Mr. President, I congratulate Mr. Corrie, Co-President of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, who has had the far from easy task of preparing a report on the difficult issue of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly. In this speech, I will limit myself to presenting only a few points that I consider fundamental. I believe the European Parliament should insistently call for the Assembly to be truly parliamentary, urging the ACP countries to send members of their national parliaments as representatives, in order to strengthen their own democratic fabric. My contribution to this debate, first and foremost, will be to focus attention on globalization and the WTO, which represent an enormous threat to the development of ACP countries. I believe a transition period is necessary for these countries, although, within the framework of the new logic and the regionalization of aid, it is also necessary for them to sustain themselves not only through agriculture and fisheries, but also to resort to the valorization of mineral and subsoil resources, some of which are being exploited with little economic benefit by these same countries. The third point concerns the effort that the European Parliament, through a joint working group within the Joint Assembly, must commit to making to achieve stabilization of the ACP states' budgets. This effort involves a qualified selection of budget items, ensuring economic and, above all, social development. It also involves monitoring the income and fiscal policies in force within the ACP region. We must support the peoples of these countries through our relationship with their leaders, who must be fully aware that development aid from the European Union is intended for the people and not for the eventual oligarchies that manage, in some of these states, all internal and external resources. Finally, the fourth point: the prevention of conflicts between ethnic groups or between states must be our constant concern, and, to a certain extent, these conflicts could be avoided either through a vigorous and authoritative diplomatic offensive or through the proposals I have just outlined. Mr. President, I endorse the positive assessment of the report expressed a moment ago by my colleague Karin Junker, and I would add that Mr. Corrie began his work as Co-President of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly with effective and impartial performance, which deserves our full recognition. My remarks will be limited to a specific event that occurred a few days ago, partly as a result of events referred to in the report we are debating here.	es
In politics, words can be inflammatory, they can inflame tempers, or they can be conciliatory. We discovered that Mr. Jörg Haider, as a wordsmith, has been a voice defending racism and xenophobia. He is a man who has preyed on fear and exploited vulnerability. Therein lies the importance of this debate—to make clear that when extremism enters the mainstream, something profound is happening in Europe today. (Applause) I hasten to add that our fight is not directed at the Austrian people. We respect the rights of the Austrian people to their own democratic process. We defend the constitutional rights and prerogatives of the Austrian people, but here in the European Parliament, we have a duty to remember our fundamental values, as stipulated in Article 6 of the Treaty—the values of freedom, democracy, and respect for human rights. All conscientious members of this Assembly believe that these values are universal and indivisible, regardless of race, class, or creed. We must promote and defend these rights, while telling the people of Austria: our fight is not against you. With regard to the Portuguese Presidency's initiative, I would like to say that we support the spirit and political intention behind it. It may not be an ideal initiative in terms of its structure, but we recognize, Mr. President-in-Office, that it is anchored in idealism, and for that reason we are inclined to support it. I share with President Prodi the preference for the Community method, and we must analyze Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty. Article 7 provides for the possibility of suspension in the event of serious and persistent breaches of our fundamental values. We must find, as institutions, a way to measure and give meaning to this, so that it has reality and substance. Then, we can work together to apply the Community method to eradicate this cancer from our environment. I would like to address a few words to Mr. Schüssel, Madam President. Mr. Schüssel is a man with an honorable record in European politics. Now he intends to ride into government on the back of a political tiger. Mr. Schüssel, you are about to assume a very serious responsibility—personal, national, and European. That responsibility, which you now assume, Mr. Schüssel, is to respect the letter and spirit of the European Treaties. Finally, Madam President, this debate touches the heart of our democratic values and institutions and reminds us that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. On this continent, especially, with the experience of the odious racism we have suffered in the past, which has exacted such a heavy toll, we must insist that today's debate is not about interference with the sovereign rights of a State. It is about the stubborn insistence on the part of the democratically elected institution of this Union that as Europeans, we will not tolerate a return to the past. (Loud applause)	es
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for my lateness, but unfortunately, this other political issue is still on the agenda today. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy recommends that you release the EUR 35 million, and this recommendation is made because this money can truly benefit the people affected. Our criticism is not so serious that we do not want to help the people there. But this does not mean that we forget to criticize. We would, of course, be much further along in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament early on and to officially submit documents. Only in this way could we have conducted truly sensible, in-depth discussions on the matter. I ask the administration to ensure that this cannot happen again in the future. It is only for the sake of the people affected that we are prepared to refrain from drawing any conclusions. However, we must ensure that we introduce certain conditions here. One condition is that the money be given where it can be used sensibly, and not to those who could potentially use it for other purposes. That is, this money should truly be under Mr. Kouchner's purview and not diverted to other areas. Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council take a different position here because they see realistic problems, we believe that the other donors must also fulfill the commitments they have entered into. This is a mission under the jurisdiction of the United Nations, and it cannot be the case that the European Union alone fulfills its obligations! The other donor countries must also fulfill their obligations during this period in the interests of the people affected. This leads me to believe that we must generally address this issue much more intensively in the future, not just with this specific project, but with the entire development in Southeast Europe and the aid being provided there. This is another example of the European Union being willing to help, to provide the money, but of the lack of consistency in its political leadership. We have so many coordinators responsible to so many employers that we'll soon have to appoint a coordinator for the coordinators. Perhaps it would be better, however, if the responsible bodies of the European Union and the other institutions – from the OSCE to the United Nations – would come together to establish a uniform, coordinated procedure and examine how the people there can be truly helped. I know that the Commission is thinking hard about how to achieve this, but if the European Union is doing most of the work, then it should also be in charge there and then implement it in a uniform manner so that the people can truly be helped. It makes no sense for us to have competition between the various international institutions and associations here rather than actual effort being put into helping the people on the ground! When I see that the donor conference for the Stability Pact is being postponed again and again, now until the end of March, that no one knows what the real projects are, that there is no overview of how they can actually be implemented, and that there are only new press conferences being held, then this does not seem to be the way in which we can achieve peace and reconciliation among the people in this part of Europe!	de
"A Common Fisheries Policy must optimally reconcile the needs of species conservation and resource management with those of the economy and the market. This will require more comprehensive, comparable, and uniform data, which, if properly collected and evaluated, will provide us with more general information about the Union's fisheries sector. However, we also hope that the specific characteristics, differences, and diverse fishing conditions and traditions will be better recognized and highlighted, rather than being ignored, restricted, or even eliminated—as has often happened—as a result of a misunderstood approach to harmonizing fisheries policy. Let me cite the Mediterranean, and fisheries in Italy in particular, as an example. After years of the CFP for the Mediterranean being limited to regulations on marketing and operating aid, Regulation 1626 and the measures it contains for the conservation and protection of fish stocks finally establish a responsible fisheries policy to ensure sustainable exploitation of fisheries. This is a worthwhile objective, but its implementation has sometimes failed to take into account the biological characteristics of Mediterranean fish species. A subsequent regulation, Regulation No. 1448 – adopted in 1999, not by chance – allowed for certain exceptions specifically for so-called ""certain Mediterranean fisheries."" However, this derogation is only valid until 31 May of this year, and the Commission must submit a proposal by then. We hope that this will take into account this fishing system, which is vital to the economy of extensive coastal areas in Italy and, according to the scientific data collected so far, has a certain sustainability from a biological perspective. Thank you, Commissioner Fischler. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. Control of certain fish diseases The next item is the report (A5-0036/2000) by Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93/53/EEC laying down minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases. Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is a contagious viral disease first recorded in Norway in 1984, later in Canada (1986), and finally in Scotland in May 1998, thus being the first time it has been detected in the European Union. Although the virus has been found in other species, the disease itself has so far been limited to salmon. The virus cannot survive above 25ºC, and scientists therefore agree that it poses no threat to human health. It simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures. The Scottish salmon farming industry is the largest of its kind in the EU, and its farms are located in outermost regions. It provides employment for approximately 6,500 people and generates approximately €800 million annually. It is therefore clear that this problem is of particular importance for Scotland, but it is of utmost importance for all parts of Europe that this disease be contained and, if possible, eradicated. Current directives prohibit vaccination; instead, all fish from an infected farm must be culled, regardless of whether they are infected or not."	de
By ratifying the Treaty of Amsterdam, all Member States declared that they wish to give the fight against fraud against the European Union's financial interests the same priority as they do against fraud against their own interests. However, the reality is that only the first four Member States have yet to ratify the agreement, adopted in 1995. The Commission fully agrees with the rapporteur that this situation is unacceptable. A legal act, a directive, that provides a uniform definition of fraudulent activities, such as money laundering or corruption, and establishes a binding obligation to prosecute them, can take an important step forward in this regard, and I will therefore propose that the Commission consider this step very promptly. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) is one of the most important instruments with which the Commission fulfills its obligation to combat fraud. The Commission has therefore not accepted that the two European banks, the ECB and the EIB, have denied OLAF's right to conduct investigations within these two institutions, citing their independent status. The Commission therefore decided at its last meeting to bring legal proceedings against these two banks, and I hope that Parliament will approve this step. The second recommendation of this report concerns the review of OLAF's investigative measures in the various European institutions for their legality. The OLAF Supervisory Committee, which was set up at the same time as OLAF was founded, is tasked with ensuring OLAF's independence, but cannot perform the task mentioned in the report of monitoring OLAF's internal investigative activities. In this, I fully agree with the Supervisory Committee and the rapporteur. This means that there is a gap here that needs to be filled, and I will examine the approach proposed in the report with a view to further developing it. However, I would like to make one request: I believe that we must prevent the debate on expanding OLAF's legal basis from leading to the misunderstanding that OLAF does not currently have sufficient authority. No, it must not lead to an undermining of OLAF's authority, and I also think that this is not what the rapporteur has in mind. I therefore ask you to fully support OLAF's work in its current form. Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. Votes (Parliament adopts the Commission's proposal.) Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE). Mr President, a point of order. I ask for an explanation of Rules 133(2) and 138(4). Both rules concern voting. Is it not the case that, with the exception of roll-call votes, votes should first be taken by a show of hands, with use of the electronic voting system only being made in cases of doubt? Yes, Mr President, I called for a show of hands, as no political group had requested a roll-call vote. As you know, a roll-call vote or electronic verification is only provided for if Members request it. In this case, I can assure you that an overwhelming majority voted in favor of the directive we have just voted on. Mr President, I was not referring to this specific vote, but to votes in general.	de
Joint resolution on Austria Madam President, the Europe of Nations Group has not signed the joint PPE/DE-PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria following the formation of a coalition government in that country between the conservatives and the national liberals of Jörg Haider. In fact, this PPE/DE-PSE resolution welcomes the initiative promoted by fourteen Member States to exert pressure on Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott. What strikes us most is that this joint intervention boasts the principles of the Treaty as if it were written somewhere that, from now on, the free and democratic expression of a people can be annulled by the will of the Heads of Government of neighbouring countries who, in this case, have been careful not to consult their respective peoples. Regardless of the verbal excesses of Jörg Haider - which we in fact condemn - the Austrians have made a democratic choice and we must respect it. It seems clear to us that the left wing of the European Parliament, in contact with the Austrian left wing, which was also defeated in the elections, has engineered an exquisitely political maneuver by recalling the memory of a sinister era, fortunately over. Although the comparison of Haider to Hitler lacks credibility, it has partially achieved its goal by making some PPE-DE deputies waver. Beyond this political maneuver, what the majority of the European Parliament fears more than anything is that the questioning in Austria of a right-left cohabitation, which has corrupted its political life, will soon extend to the European system of co-management, which has caused equally disastrous consequences. To avoid this questioning, this majority is prepared to do anything, even to annul the results of free elections, to establish a thought police, to establish a new form of totalitarianism. Madam President, on behalf of the members of the National Front, the Vlaams Blok and the Italian Social Movement, I ask this question: who is pulling the strings of the unprecedented interference in Austrian affairs in which the European Union has taken part, in violation of international law, the Treaties and morality? Is the hysteria spontaneous? Is it the fruit of pure stupidity or, more likely, of a precise strategy, the same everywhere in the world? Who is imposing their will on the European nations, claiming to prevent them from deciding their own destiny? Some hidden alliance? The government in Washington? The Israeli government? Or their socialist spokesmen who, in this Chamber, have the nerve to impose their values on us? What are the values of these socialists, who built their electoral fortune in the last century by deluding the underprivileged with the idea of greater social justice, and who today are nothing but the party of protected civil servants, trade unionists and state capitalism? What are the values of the Belgian Socialist Party that is struggling between scandals of pedophilia and corruption, passing through those of Vandam, like the Agusta scandal? What are the values of the French Socialist Party that has blackmailed all the municipalities where it held the majority in the Urba, Sages, Graco affairs?	it
"I have also submitted, on behalf of the EDD Group, a draft resolution on this matter. Mr. President, in recent years, oil tankers have caused repeated disasters around the world without any appreciable or effective measures having been taken to prevent them. This time, the situation is particularly serious, not least because it affects a large European state, a fact that could happen again at any time. We urgently need a directive to limit these risks. The 15 rules we have are apparently not enough. They offer at least—without claiming to be exhaustive—three guarantees: no oil tanker or cargo ship fit for scrapping may now call at any European Union port; all parties involved, including the consignee of the transport, must be liable for the damage caused and must take out adequate insurance policies. Only in this way will it be possible to ensure that those affected can assert their right to compensation for the damage suffered. However, we must be clear that the long-term objective must be much broader. In other words, we must assess the true costs of our entire energy supply system. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Commissioner De Palacio for her clear, appropriate, and also very firm response. Thank you very much. This also means that I have great respect, in any case, for the communication from the meeting she sent on January 10, but also for the measures she announced today. The Erika disaster shows that when proper traffic and transport regulations are lacking at European and international level, nature and the environment suffer. The damage inflicted, including in environmental matters, cannot be quantified in monetary terms. That is why we are now holding this joint debate with my colleagues from transport and environmental protection. During the Christmas holidays, when the Dutch media were paying attention to the Erika disaster, I looked online to find out what action was available, especially after Prime Minister Jospin had said that Europe should do more. What I deduced from all this is that there is actually enough regulation, but the problem lies in the lack of control. Let me mention a few issues here, which have also been highlighted by the Commissioner. First, ""port-state control,"" the 25% of ships that must be controlled. I not only believe that this 25% should be maintained, but we must also ensure that it is controlled more, that is, that this 25% should be increased. Furthermore, when a ship is no longer permitted to sail, not only must the facts be controlled, but there must also be a legal system that establishes: it is advisable that it no longer sail, or it is no longer permitted to sail. But this does not exist. Mr. President, with regard to this issue, I would like to see action taken. Finally, regarding the technical requirements for ships, my colleagues have also just pointed out that, since 1999, oil tankers in the United States must have double hulls."	es
Is this the message we wish to convey? Furthermore, one point in particular is close to my heart: Member States must be able, when they wish, to decide to set up transnational water transfers. This type of project reflects the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity that we have always defended. In this spirit, it should benefit, largely, from the support of the European Union, within the framework of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds). I would like to point out that our Assembly adopted, two years ago, an own-initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European hydraulic networks and I would appreciate it if the European Commission could soon inform the European Parliament of the follow-up it has given to this report. (ES) We have witnessed the transformation of a report that was primarily concerned with the quality of water in Europe into an instrument of trade war. We all agree that water quality is a goal of prime importance, especially given the adverse consequences that the development of the accelerated industrial growth model has on nature. It is clear that the logic of private benefit inherent in this model has been harmful, which is why the polluter pays principle is adequate to address these consequences. But beyond these principles, we must consider water as a common good that cannot be subject to market rules. Surprisingly, I imagine that with the best intentions, this ecological objective has been transformed into an instrument of commercial warfare by making consumers, especially in the agricultural sector, bear the cost of installations and procedures to ensure good water quality. In fact, water becomes yet another commodity subject to market laws. Thus, the neoliberal model is being applied to water. When we do not differentiate between countries and regions where water is abundant and poses no problems, and regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity, limiting their possibilities for minimal economic and social development, we are already distorting the ecological principle into a devastating weapon. In the same vein, it is somewhat ironic to complicate the possibility of sharing this commodity, which in some areas is scarce, while those who live in regions where water is abundant advise those living in regions affected by drought to restrict water. It is this lack of sensitivity and solidarity that motivated my vote, as an MEP from one of the dry Mediterranean agricultural regions but with prospects like the Murcia region. On behalf of the Labour Party in the European Parliament, I would like to point out that, although we supported most of the Lienemann report, we have certain reservations. The date set in the report – 2020 – is unrealistic and impossible to meet, but the date set by the Council – 2034 – is too far away. We therefore believe that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	fr
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a directive on end-of-life vehicles that we are dealing with today aims, on the one hand, to ensure a high level of environmental protection within the Union, but also to maintain the proper functioning of the internal market in this sector. A few words to say that, of course, historic and vintage vehicles must be excluded from the scope of this directive. Cars too, and I think we will all agree on this, are part of our cultural heritage. Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, that is, the date of application of the directive. The solution proposed by Parliament, namely 18 months from the entry into force of the directive itself, for vehicles placed on the market for the first time, is not very realistic. The European car fleet includes several tens of millions of cars that will have to be withdrawn even though they were not at all designed to be recycled. The common position was more practicable because it provided for the 2006 date for vehicles already in circulation. This would also give companies time to build up funds to cover additional expenditure. Like my group, I will support the common position in this respect, which I believe represents a balanced compromise between the constraints on companies and the necessary progress in environmental protection. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament must make an important decision today, namely whether it will commit itself to environmental and consumer protection that opens up a new way forward, or whether it will be prepared to lackey the German car industry, as the amendments tabled by Mr Florenz, Mr Lange and others suggest. The credibility of Parliament as a pioneer in environmental protection is at stake. It would be extremely disheartening if Parliament were to take more than one step back from the positions of the governments of the 14 Member States and the Commission on producer responsibility and environmental protection. The aim pursued by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange is clear: to destroy the directive! By proposing to share responsibility, they are aiming to deprive the polluter pays principle of all substance and to nip product innovation in the bud. By placing a whole series of obstacles, they are aiming solely to prevent a material flow policy and, by imposing approvals for different models, they want to postpone the implementation of the directives by at least 12 years, which is completely unacceptable. I therefore appeal, especially to the German Members of Parliament: do not allow such serious political damage to be done today! The Green-Red government leading the Federal Republic has certainly not done itself credit in the debate on the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive. Let us not continue this trend! The complaints about competitive disadvantages are ridiculous if it is really only a question of harming the German car industry! Behave as representatives of the people and do not allow yourselves to be degraded to representatives of Volkswagen! Vote for environmental and consumer protection as well as for innovation in the car industry and recycling! Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997 and it is time to reach an agreement. Since I broadly agree with the positions of my colleague Mr Sjöstedt and the Green representative, Mr De Roo, I will not use the two minutes at my disposal, but will focus on just two issues.	it
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to repeat what the rapporteur and my colleague, Mr Coelho, have said before me. All of this is indeed correct and relevant. The euro can easily be counterfeited. We are currently in a dangerous transition phase in which an unprecedented phenomenon is emerging from a criminal law perspective: a currency that has not yet been used, not yet put into circulation, but is only used as banknote money, can nevertheless already be counterfeited, even though the offence of counterfeiting is not punishable in this specific case because the currency is not yet in circulation. This is therefore a very complex problem. Clearly, if we do not act quickly – I agree with my colleague, Mr Cederschiöld – counterfeit euros can already be produced, and their putting into circulation cannot be subject to any criminal sanction. I would like to point out in passing that this might be an attractive prospect for some. What is the European Union doing to address this possibility? A series of relevant points, which our colleague, Mrs Cederschiöld, has detailed for us. In relation to what has been described, Parliament should focus less on the content of the framework decision and the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschiöld than on the procedures currently applied. Indeed, the way in which the European Parliament was consulted by the Council, which is by far the least democratic institution in Europe, insults the concept of democracy. We have received for consultation a text that the Council itself has been tinkering with for a very long time, a text which, moreover, is only a partial success – but I will come to that immediately. The European Parliament must now take a position, within three months, on this complex, difficult and, in some places, contradictory text proposed by the Council. It is only thanks to the considerable investment made by our colleague, Mr Cederschiöld, and to the fact that Parliament has resigned itself to not making use of its democratic right, which allows it to apply its consultation procedures with sufficient time and all the texts translated into each language, that we can now give our opinion within the short timescale requested by the Council and thus reach the decision that must be made in March. For a subject as important as protection against counterfeiting and the criminal law harmonisation that it requires, we really cannot work at the infernal pace imposed on us by the Council. That is why I wish to state very clearly on behalf of my group that we had long discussions with our colleague, Mr Cederschiöld, to determine whether it was reasonable to work under these conditions. We came to the conclusion that it was not, but that given the importance of the subject, we agreed to accept such a procedure. The proposed framework decision constitutes undeniable progress. Only the legal certainty desired by the Council - Mrs Cederschiöld has already alluded to this - will ultimately not be fully achieved because, as regards the minimum standards required, the minimum criminal standard and, above all, the application of the same criminal standards in each Member State - even those in which the euro has not yet been introduced, but in which it could theoretically be falsified - these gaps have not been filled.	fr
I can only say that these are the truly tough nuts that need to be cracked once and for all! Mr. President, first of all, I would like to sincerely congratulate my colleague, Mr. Van Hulten. It is nice to be able to say that he belongs to our delegation, and I think I can be a little proud of him. In any case, congratulations on your report. Mr. President, the resignation of the Commission has caused a feeling of fear among many officials in the hierarchical and bureaucratic ranks. I believe the whole argument about making a change towards a culture of responsibility is essential. In the Committee on Development, I have seen firsthand how thousands of projects have come to a standstill; how, sometimes, up to 80 percent of the money has not been invested, sometimes creating a huge money pit. And this, not because it is not absolutely necessary, not because there are no good proposals, but because the entire system clogs itself up. Lack of accountability, too much ex ante, too little ex post, and from this emerges a culture based on very few truly effective investments. Spending money efficiently and organizing all the work around this—it would be fantastic if we could signal in that direction with this report. I eagerly hope that the contribution we will make here, if the Commission's first draft report becomes an official report on 1 March, will allow us to see real changes. Without a doubt, this will be a service, Mr. President, rendered to the European public, and thanks to the results we show, we will regain and recover some of what we have obviously lost in recent years. This is the best support we can give to European democracy. If we thereby emerge from the culture of the 1950s and move into the next century, we will have a pleasant experience here. Mr. President, first of all, my congratulations to Michiel Van Hulten for his first report. It was a difficult trial, but in the Netherlands, we have a nice saying: You learn to swim faster if you jump in early. Your Honor, I believe that after this test, you can qualify for the Olympics. There are two points that, in my opinion, deserve special attention from the ELDR. First, the individual responsibility of Commissioners. This must be regulated during the IGC. We prefer, however, that this important issue not be left entirely in the hands of the Council, and we have therefore tabled an amendment calling for an interinstitutional agreement between the Commission and Parliament, in order to ensure a kind of fallback position and not leave our fate entirely in the hands of the Council. The second point, and my colleague, Mr. Mulder, has already said this, is that the ELDR believes that the European Parliament should be vetted by independent experts. This will go a long way to restoring, in particular, the confidence of European citizens in this institution. We cannot credibly oppose this reformed Commission until we examine our consciences and the European Parliament also puts its affairs in order.	es
You will find the content of this framework in the Accession Partnership Priorities, which the Commission and the Council defined last year and which are now being implemented in the corresponding planning and management of projects. Contrary to this criticism, I would say that one can deplore a lack of coherence in certain areas of European policy, but that in this case I would like to claim that the Commission and the Council have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, after the Commissioner has shown us in an extremely coherent manner that the then President of the Council and his Federal Minister for European Affairs were responsible for the lack of coherence, perhaps you could help the Commissioner and us to make this decision. It would be very helpful if you could respond positively to my questions on the financial perspective up to 2004 and on heading 7, or if you could at least state – as the Commissioner will try to get the Commission to do – that the Portuguese Presidency intends to compensate for the lack of coherence at the time with such a commitment. Mr President, I believe that the question raised by my friend Elmar Brok will be examined by the Council. I believe that the criticism levelled at the previous Presidency is irrelevant. I believe that what was done by the previous Presidency in defining the financial perspective was excellent work, regardless of who was involved in that work. In any case, the question he is asking is important, and we in the Council will continue to support the proposals that the Commission will present in this regard. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I understood that our colleague Mr Brok was referring to an even earlier Presidency. Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen has not answered my very specific question on the MEDA financial instrument. I would ask him to answer it, as his answer will determine our voting behaviour on various amendments. Commission. (DE) Dear Mr Poos, I apologize. There was some confusion at the precise moment you asked your question. So, as far as MEDA is concerned, Malta and Cyprus can participate in the supraregional programmes, but not the national ones, because their income is too high. Thank you very much, Commissioner Verheugen! The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday. Question Time (Council) Question No. 1 of (H-0022/00): Subject: Control of access to Community waters by oil tankers Following the sinking of the oil tanker Erika off the French coast, which caused an oil spill, what measures does the Council propose to adopt to control access to Community waters by oil tankers flying flags of convenience and not complying with Community safety standards? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January, the Council considered the consequences of the sinking of the oil tanker Erika in December.	fr
The European Commission's Sixth Report offers some very valuable conclusions. I would like to briefly summarize two of them; the rapporteur has already mentioned them: one positive and one negative. The first concerns the fact that significant progress has been made in territorial and social cohesion throughout the Union, and that Community funds represent an important, if not decisive, factor in reducing regional disparities. The negative aspect is that these major efforts have had a greater impact on converging the GDP and productivity of European regions than on converging their employment levels. Therefore, it is necessary to link structural funding more closely to job creation. This, Commissioner, is the first priority for the coming period. Therefore, Mr President, I ask my distinguished colleagues to support this report, and, like other colleagues before me, I call on the Commission to carefully consider the conclusions of its Sixth Periodic Report when planning for the period 2000-2006. Mr President! Commissioner! Dear colleagues, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for the factual consideration given to the proposed amendments received during the committee's discussion. The sixth periodic report provides a good basis for assessing the implementation of regional policy objectives in the Union and shows that, despite all efforts, growth is uneven. The regions of Central Europe continue to experience particularly rapid growth, with growth in the strong economic centers occurring at a pace that is above the European average, while many southern and northern European regions are progressing considerably more slowly. What is now needed is an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not achieving the desired success in all areas. Is this due to bureaucracy, or have the differences between the regions, the great distances, very cold or hot climates, sparse populations, and harsh conditions not been sufficiently taken into account? How is the Union managing to meet the challenges of global development in such a way that even the less developed regions can keep pace? It is also important to examine the impact of enlargement on the Structural Funds and the development of the outermost regions. Member States must not shirk their responsibilities here either. Some countries have violated the principle of co-financing and reduced national funding for the regions while increasing the Union's regional aid. This has been to the detriment of regional policy. In the future, we must also consider establishing indicators that will enable measures to be targeted at the right time and in the right place. Uncontrolled migration, for example, has not been sufficiently taken into account. In this context, too, the crucial importance of small and medium-sized enterprises as a driver of employment and regional development must be emphasized. The introduction of the latest technology and know-how by companies in lagging regions is very important. Our group supports the adoption of this report. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to date, the European Community's regional policy has failed to significantly reflect the existing disparities in per capita performance.	de
"That is why we expressed our great satisfaction with the decisions taken on this matter at the Helsinki Summit in December. An overly ambitious programme would currently risk delaying the enlargement process. This is not what we want and that is why we voted against the report. However, we fully agree with our colleagues that the Intergovernmental Conference must be transparent so that citizens can see how our work is progressing. (SV) We are pleased that a limited agenda was set for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Summit. Potential future Member States must also participate in the formation of the future EU and have an influence on it. The 1999 European Parliament elections made it abundantly clear that citizens do not support the arguments for an ever more federalist EU in the spirit of Brussels. With the opening of the next IGC, the European Union process is once again topical. Once again, the debate will be monopolized by heads of state and government. That is to say, fifteen people will discuss and decide behind closed doors the fate of more than 350 million individuals. We can therefore understand the disinterest of the people in the face of European construction being carried out behind their backs and far from their concerns. Indeed, one only has to look at the agenda of the IGC: the institutions, enlargement, and autonomous defense. In reality, it is about strengthening the executive power, developing annexations to the liberalism of Eastern countries, and relaunching the militarization of Europe, notably by increasing military budgets. Social Europe, used as a foil by the EU, has completely disappeared from the agenda. All this only legitimizes the development, on a European scale, of resistance movements anxious to impose a social charter that would harmonize the main demands of workers from above. This is why I am voting against the report. I voted for the resolution that gives a favorable opinion on the convening of the IGC because it enshrines the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency, which enjoys the support of a large majority of Parliament, of opening up the IGC agenda, beyond the points strictly related to the rebalancing of power between Member States, large and small, as originally described in the convening of the Helsinki Council. Unfortunately, in the topics addressed in the resolutions relating to the matters of the Treaty on European Union that will be subject to revision, nothing indicates, to date, the need to revise its Article 7, which deals with the suspension of a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the ""founding"" principles of the Union, set out in Article 6. As we see with the current crisis with Austria, the Union has the right to defend itself. The legal mechanisms provided for by the Treaties are nevertheless weak, difficult to apply politically and legally, they do not organize the powers of the institutions and they do not guarantee judicial treatment for a process of the highest importance, namely, the condemnation of a Member State to suspension."	fr
Your Honor, with regard to the Presidency's ability to support the actions of non-governmental organizations, particularly in the specific case of the fight against homelessness, I would like to tell you that these kinds of initiatives are worthy of our approval, and we are fully prepared to consider supporting them. We have collaborated with Portuguese non-governmental organizations and with some initiatives that these same non-governmental organizations presented within the Portuguese Presidency's framework for action, which we link to the set of concerns underlying our own program. We do not have any specific initiatives in this regard, but we do not rule out the possibility that an initiative from non-governmental organizations proposed to us in this regard could be examined during our Presidency: this, it should be said, falls within the scope of the Council's powers. But we must understand that anything that might affect the Commission's right of initiative must, of course, be done through the Commission itself. Mr. President-in-Office of the Council, you've told us a lot about the future: what the Commission is going to do, what the Presidency is going to do in Lisbon, etc. And you've told us something that frightened me, Mr. President-in-Office of the Council. You said that in Lisbon you're going to discuss a more dynamic and competitive development. I've begun to get scared, Mr. President-in-Office of the Council, because that's where social exclusion comes from, at least in part. I don't see how you're going to be able to answer, if you have opinions like that. What I've asked, and I'm asking again, is the following: What are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on issues such as those, for example, presented by the networks for combating poverty and exclusion, on the division of labor and social security, on the implementation of fiscal policy, especially of speculative capital, on the policy of income redistribution? I would like an answer on this, whether the Portuguese Presidency has this in mind and intends to do something. The Honorable Member must understand that the effective capacity of a Presidency to reverse general social or economic trends in its six months of office is indeed limited. I believe it is perfectly clear that our capacity is also closely linked to the Commission's own right of initiative. I have spoken of the extraordinary European Council and the initiative Portugal took to hold it, and I have referred to the future because there are two complementary ways of viewing this issue of social exclusion: one is the set of immediate measures that must be adopted to address its specific effects; the second is the creation of conditions of international competitiveness that allow us to improve the economic fabric within the European Union, with positive side effects on the problems of social exclusion. Therefore, the Portuguese Presidency does not have any miracle keys to respond in six months to issues that have been going on forever. It is available to act on Commission proposals in these areas, in all areas that fall within the Community's competence. It naturally has the potential and the benefit of encouraging the full range of measures that may be presented, particularly by non-governmental organizations, but also within traditional intergovernmental coordination in these areas.	es
This is the programme for the next five years in the area of internal security, freedom, citizens' rights and judicial cooperation. This document, in its brevity, is nothing but a farce! A farce precisely because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what is presented on paper is in clear contrast with reality. A document of this kind is not at all the basis for a scoreboard. It has been welcomed and praised as a great achievement, but personally I remain convinced of the need for a scoreboard. Parliament wants to seriously examine the basis for a programme in which future developments in this policy area will be included. We are calling for minimum standards for asylum procedures, in order to be able to provide timely assistance to refugees but also to provide clarity for those who are not. We want tools that will allow us to prevent abuse. We want a Community immigration policy to be launched that obviously also takes into account the integration capacity of the Member States; we also need to strengthen the operational functions of EUROPOL, for example, by adopting very concrete measures in this area to combat organised crime. We are taking these tasks seriously and enthusiastically and we ask the Commission to do the same even when it is simply a matter of submitting a document! Madam President, I too applaud the Commission's initiative to present us with a document on its strategic objectives for the next five years, with the hope, however, that it intends to correct, in subsequent documents, the excessive generalities and the vagueness of the text submitted to us today. Having said that, Madam President, here I am again crying in the wilderness about the absence of a fisheries policy. It is truly astonishing that in the strategic objectives for the next few years, the Commission does not include the process of reviewing one of its common policies in view of the reform that is to be finalised in 2002. This review process is undoubtedly the most important event that will affect the fisheries sector for many years to come. It seems, however, that this is not the opinion of the Commission, which has nevertheless been given the task of presenting to the Council and Parliament, by 2001, a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade, which will serve as a basis for the Council to take the appropriate decisions to amend it. In reality, the revision process has already begun for many institutions, such as for example the European Parliament, which already in 1998 drew up and approved a report highlighting all the problems and shortcomings that the common fisheries policy still suffers from. We have asked for a minimum timetable for the revision several times without receiving a response. A period of less than two years is not a long time, given that, we must not forget, the fisheries policy is experiencing an anomalous situation as regards the rules of the internal market and that these anomalies should be resolved within the reform process.	it
Madam President, distinguished Members, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mr. Procacci for the report he has prepared. But I would also like to thank the committees that collaborated and Parliament for the broad support they have given to the LEADER+ initiative. This initiative aims to give rural areas new impetus to develop and test new and original approaches, approaches that should later be included as models in the general programmes. I am also pleased that Parliament essentially supports the Commission's concept that the LEADER+ programme should be implemented in all rural regions, that higher priorities should be introduced, and that, above all, active cooperation and interconnection of rural areas must be encouraged. In this regard, I note that Parliament shares the Commission's view that priority should be given to implementing LEADER+ in the form of global grants. To answer some specific questions that have been raised here, I must also confirm that we wish to have the broadest possible participation and partnership in LEADER+. Various groups, whether environmental organizations or employment-focused groups, have the opportunity to collaborate in the drafting of Commission directives. The resources made available during this period are not fewer, but rather more. I would also like to point out that setting up an observatory is nothing new. There has also been an observatory for LEADER I and LEADER II. This office's sole objective is to maintain the interconnection of specific LEADER groups. Funding for this observatory should not exceed 2% of LEADER resources. Regarding the possibility of projects focused on training and development, I must say that this is precisely a point we have now integrated into the new rural development policy, so that, from our point of view, it is no longer necessary to do so within the framework of LEADER. I now turn to the content of the report. In point 14, Parliament urges the Commission to submit a report on the evaluation of LEADER II without delay. I would simply like to point out that at the moment this does not make much sense, since, as in the past—specifically, until the end of 2002—funds can be withdrawn under LEADER II. For this reason, we believe it makes more sense to conduct this evaluation once the program concludes. We will, of course, do so and will send you a report on it. In Item 18, Parliament proposes the production of a compendium of examples of successful initiatives. In this regard, I cannot but say that one already exists. It has already been prepared by the Commission, and I can make it available to any Member of this House who is interested. In Item 21, Parliament insists that the guidelines for LEADER+ must be adopted quickly so that the programs can begin.	es
We find you, as always, faithful to the fundamental values, to those principles that have always guided your action. You also reminded us of your 1994 speech, which you yourself described as provocative; in this regard, it must be said that utopias can sometimes be productive and we were able to evaluate together the path taken. You also appropriately highlighted the fundamental role of civil society, not only in relation to the candidate countries but also within each country of the European Union, to restore citizens' confidence and credibility to social solidarity, which we need so much. Finally, summarizing the concept that struck me most in your speech, you wanted to explain to us that, beyond the economic aspects, the construction of Europe must first and foremost be a work of the spirit. We sincerely hope to continue this work with you. Thank you, Mr President. (The formal sitting ended at 12.40 p.m.) ACP-EU Joint Assembly The next item on the agenda is the debate on the annual report A5-0032/2000 by Mr Corrie on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation on the results of the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1999. Mr President, I had hoped to be speaking at 9 a.m. rather than 9 p.m. to present the report. I hope that the number of Members present in the Chamber does not indicate a lack of interest in development work in overseas countries. However, it is standard practice for the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly to be presented to Members of the European Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing so this evening. Once again I can report on two very important sessions, one in Strasbourg and the other in Nassau. In many ways it was the end of an old era and the beginning of a new one. The ACP-EU Joint Assembly is a unique organisation on the world political scene. Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss issues of common interest? The Strasbourg session was the last one chaired by Lord Plumb. In recognition of his outstanding work in difficult times, the Bureau of the Joint Assembly in Nassau elected him Honorary President, and now that he has come to the end of his career we wish him all the best for the years to come. The two sessions were dominated by negotiations on the renewal of the Lomé Convention: I look forward to the new Convention being signed and to all the countries concerned ratifying it as soon as possible. I remember that at the last mid-term review, when I was rapporteur, the then Commissioner Marín said that there would not be another. Well, he was wrong and I would like to pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new Convention in very difficult circumstances. I was also very pleased to hear the statement this morning from Commissioner Nielson, who has worked tirelessly to ensure the success of the negotiations. I pay tribute to him in particular for the success achieved, but also to Mrs Kinnock and her working group for their commitment to the future of Lomé.	it
Now that you, Mr Prodi, and your predecessors have deprived citizens of their right to self-determination, the quality of the work carried out in Brussels must improve significantly and must be carried out in full transparency so that citizens at least have the impression that they are being heard. I would just like to make a comment about what Mr Dell'Alba said about the dream of the founding fathers: Just read the memoirs of Jean Monnet. His dream was to create what he called a small, practical secretariat. It is certainly not this small secretariat that Mr Prodi is now president of. Madam President, this morning, Commission President Prodi outlined the European Union's ambitious objectives for the next five years, laudable objectives indeed, to ensure a strong and effective European presence in the world: ensuring the success of enlargement, meeting the challenge of selling electronic Europe, and introducing better principles of governance. We understand that Europeans, especially the younger generation, need to be given a broad view of where Europe will be in the years ahead. But how can we succeed when available resources are limited and the credibility of our institutions is undermined? We must make this project correspond to reality. Here, there are three elements I would like to outline. First, we need a thriving European economy. We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to fall throughout Europe, consolidate the trend toward privatization and deregulation, encourage the introduction of information technology and Internet literacy, and show that e-Europe is a positive initiative. However, we must avoid falling back into the pitfalls of old-fashioned regulation, which stifles individual initiative and entrepreneurship. We must not fear globalization, but we must ensure that we understand its political impact within the network society. Without a thriving European economy, we will not be able to meet the challenges ahead, and especially the challenge of enlargement. Secondly, we must ensure that we only legislate when necessary – in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. Doing less, but better – a central point of the last Commission – must also become the objective of this Commission. We will examine this point in detail when we move on to the annual programmes of legislative proposals. Mr Bonde rightly said that there is this image of doing less but better, and then, suddenly, we see that the annual programme for the year 2000 has 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to indicate a completely different direction. We must establish priorities and ensure that the money is used wisely in each of these programmes. Finally, we must ensure that the European Commission is reformed properly, genuinely. Yes, the Commission – guardian of the Treaties – is supposed to be an independent body, but it must also be accountable to the citizens of Europe through our Parliament. The problem of information, to which Mr Bonde has just referred, is being treated as if it were a mere possibility, with the Commission appearing to restrict the information to which, as citizens and as parliamentarians, we are entitled under the Treaties.	fr
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year has unleashed enormous competitive tensions among European companies which are being met by a wave of mergers of unprecedented proportions. For example, last year's figures put the total value of mergers in Europe at €1.4 trillion, or seven times the level of the peak in the previous European merger boom, 1990. This poses enormous challenges to competition policy, which I hope can be met, as it is certain that many of these mergers will be aimed at protecting companies' profit margins from competition rather than simply boosting productivity and enabling companies to operate on a larger scale. Commissioner Monti and his colleagues face a challenge of gigantic proportions and the Liberal Democrat and Reform Group is concerned about a possible dilution of competition policy, both in terms of scrutiny of mergers and in terms of policing restrictive practices. The delegation of powers to national authorities is a good thing, but we would like to underline an assumption made by Mr von Wogau in his report regarding the need for constant monitoring of national authorities to prevent any deviations in the European component and we would like, in particular, for the Commissioner to reassure us that there will be random checks in this area. Mr President, in the limited time available to me, I would like to support the work done by all the rapporteurs and to agree with many of the statements heard in this debate, and in particular with Mr Jonckheer in criticising the excessive aggregation of data and in underlining the need for transparency and a socio-economic assessment of aid. I also agree with the criticism regarding the insufficient attention given to the development of Article 82, especially when we are witnessing abuses of a dominant position in a context of market concentrations. As a Member of the Basque Country, I would like to express my full support for the measures to implement the necessary market competition. If I say this, it is to dispel any doubts that may have arisen from the criticisms we have levelled at the Commission in general, and at Commissioner Monti in particular, for having opened proceedings against the incentives paid to Basque companies, considering them to be State subsidies. Our disagreement is due to the fact that the Commission still shows that it does not understand the nature of the general system and of co-responsibility of our legal system, by virtue of which the Basque tax provisions have the same nature, the same foundation and the same purposes as the provisions of the Member States of the European Union and are applied generally to all taxpayers who, on the basis of the rules governing the relationship between the State and the Regions in fiscal matters, must comply with them. Mr President, Commissioner, it is true, we need competition! We need it to reduce unemployment to a minimum, to have high-level health care, for social justice, to have high social standards; then of course - and these are criteria of competition from a national economy - we also need competition between companies: maximum quality of products, same conditions of access to the market for all companies, eco-friendly products.	it
The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the question of whether Europe has some principles, some common values, whether it is limited to an economic free trade area or whether, instead, it has a greater aspiration: to want to be a supranational union, in ways to be defined, which also wants to trace a new path of civilization and democracy in the world. This is what was wanted and is meant when a European Constitution is called for. The modification of the Treaties has instead been limited to a revision of some internal rules, a necessary and important revision but which does not answer the fundamental question that precedes it: what is Europe, what are its common principles and, therefore, its objectives and its limits? But politics takes revenge and, chased out the window by a debate on a limited agenda, comes back, in reality, through the door, and through the main door with the Austrian case, since in Austria a party that seems to refer to intolerance, xenophobia, and forms of racism is in government. And it is not a problem of ties with the past; It is a question of prospects for the future, and there is nothing more wrong than to be divided, on this, between right and left. I belong to a world, that of liberal Catholics, which is not left-wing but which is as attached to the values of tolerance, to common European values as anyone else and which has nothing to do with lines that deny these values. The Council did well to raise this issue before Europe and the world, and if these values are not recalled in a fundamental Charter of Rights, in a European Constitution, we will build a Europe that will not have solid and lasting foundations. I know, Commissioner Barnier - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values: take advantage of the openings left to you by the December Conference to include these issues and these principles, because only in this way will we build a lasting Europe. Mr President, I find myself in the pleasant situation in which I can refer to some interesting interventions by a small group of Nordic sceptics who oppose the violent and widespread process of integration that profoundly threatens the whole of democratic Europe. I am thinking of the speeches by Mr Bonde and Mr Sjöstedt, who point out that this proposal contains a series of relatively unconscious, but undoubtedly rational and power-driven initiatives towards a centralist and federalist European Union. They rightly mentioned the problem of monetary union and central management, and set out some alternative democratic principles. I may add that all the rational political agitation in my country, Denmark, is dictated by the fact that we are enormously increasing the number of countries belonging to the European Union and thus expanding in breadth, so that it is impossible, at the same time, to achieve deeper integration while pursuing more intensive qualitative integration towards the United States of Europe, which is what has happened so far.	it
I did this not only because I was born in a seaside city, Genoa, but above all because the borders of the regions bordered by the sea are also borders. These borders open the door to African states and the Middle East: we must give greater consideration to the importance of developing coastal regions throughout Europe. As a Member of the European Parliament from a border region, this third INTERREG initiative is of particular interest to me. It is impossible to overemphasize the difficulties that have arisen in the past in economically, socially, and culturally separated border regions on the coast and inland. The existence of the border has turned them into peripheral zones of their respective states, which has often led public authorities to neglect these regions in national policies. This is why the Interreg Community Initiative was launched back in 1990. Its objective is to promote cross-border, transnational, and interregional cooperation and the balanced development of the Community area with the aim of strengthening the Union's economic and social cohesion. INTERREG essentially finances joint projects in the areas of SME support, vocational training and education, cultural exchange, healthcare, environmental protection and improvement, and energy, transport, and telecommunications networks. I would particularly like to emphasize that interregional cooperation contributes to the involvement of local and regional authorities in the European integration process. It is indeed important to encourage more active participation by local and regional authorities in Community initiatives, since, due to differences in the legal framework and level of development on either side of the border, local and regional authorities often have very limited opportunities for cooperation. Within the framework of cooperation in cross-border areas, particular attention must be paid to improving the framework conditions for job-creating small and medium-sized enterprises. Equally, given that 50% of unemployment is structural, the financial resources provided under INTERREG must be substantial enough to meaningfully complement national employment promotion measures. In concrete terms, cross-border mobility is still all too often prevented, hampered, or made particularly problematic by obstacles related to tax policy (double taxation) and social security. My hope is that the projects under the individual programmes will help find solutions to these problems and give concrete substance to the principle of free movement of workers, which is not particularly well-developed in my region. Furthermore, INTERREG funds must also contribute to the creation of a European research area. Last but not least, there are high expectations of this initiative in the regions, as the areas not eligible for Objective 2 hope to receive compensation from INTERREG! So, a great deal is at stake, because the integration of border regions represents an important element in the development of a future European spatial planning policy! It is to be hoped that everyone is as aware of this as F. Decourrière, whom I congratulate. The INTERREG Community Initiative is part of a harmful European regional policy. This policy, which appears generous because it is officially intended to support regions in difficulty, represents a bad deal for French taxpayers. While France contributes 17% to the European budget, it receives only 8% of the regional structural funds.	de
"(The sitting adjourned at 00:05) Sinking of the Erika The next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Commission on the sinking of the Erika. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to commend Mr Fischler for his consideration in being with us today. Yesterday, our President informed us that he would be absent due to his schedule. But I believe that he reflected and did what he usually does: show consideration and respect for this Parliament, as he has always shown, and I thank him for that. I rise today in this Chamber on behalf of the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries to focus our concerns once again on the sinking of the oil tanker Erika. A dual political consideration has led our committee – and myself, as Chairman of this committee – to raise our voices in this matter. Firstly, to demonstrate to the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this Parliament cannot and will not forget this serious accident. And secondly, to focus today on a concrete aspect of the serious environmental disaster caused by this accident, namely its impact on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions. The epilogue to this accident must undoubtedly be the urgent adoption of measures to repair the damage and prevent such a disaster from recurring in the future. Enough of the lamentations and the reflections. We must all, Mr President, get straight to the point and adopt measures. Firstly, safety in maritime transport - especially when it comes to the transport of hydrocarbons and dangerous goods - requires effective controls in Community waters and in its ports. Issues such as ship construction, double hulls, their age, control by classification societies, insurance, the creation of databases containing all the necessary information, Community cooperation and coordination, increased control by inspectors, and the liability of carriers and cargo owners will all have to be addressed, and in this respect, the Commission is best placed to launch serious proposals for European harmonization in these matters. Transport carried out under flags of convenience - which also cause such damage to fishing that we have called for ""responsible fishing"" - must also be subject to special monitoring and regulation. The entry into Community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience that do not comply with Community safety standards must be controlled. We expect the Commission to take concrete measures. With regard to the fishing and aquaculture sectors - which are particularly important, developed and prestigious in the affected areas of Brittany and Vendée - the European Commission must make known the damage caused, its assessment and the specific measures of any kind it intends to adopt - political, economic, social, financial, etc., to repair the damage caused to fishermen and industries that have been seriously affected overnight. How are we going to regain consumer confidence in products from this region? What compensation will the victims receive? We are facing a very serious problem that the European Union - an economic, commercial, industrial and fishing power - cannot afford to leave unsolved. Commissioner, we must get to work. We must be pioneers and avant-garde in matters of environmental, industrial and professional destruction."	fr
I am against Amendments 7 to 13, which were also decisively rejected by the Committee on Fisheries. Their content is largely unnecessary or is already included in my proposal. In particular, I have focused on the need to study the extent of the disease and the interaction between farmed and wild salmon, to discover the origin of the disease and to extend research on the virus to wild species. These amendments, tabled by the Green MEPs of the Verts/ALE Group, serve to justify Amendment 13. This amendment is completely unacceptable, as it not only seeks to retain the provision requiring the immediate compulsory slaughter of all salmon, but also to prohibit farms affected by the virus from selling any fish, whether infected or not. I must stress that the current directive prohibits the sale of infected fish and that there is certainly no proposal to change this rule and allow their sale. Amendments 7 to 13 13 simply do not take into account the reality of the conflicting data from Scotland and Norway. In Scotland, a draconian measure was applied which did not achieve its objectives. In Norway, with greater experience, the mandatory 100 percent eradication of fish was abandoned a few years ago and a series of measures were adopted which have significantly improved the situation. It is in our interests to contain the disease in Scotland and prevent its spread. Last week in Scotland, a report on contagious salmon anaemia was published by a joint government and industry working group. This comprehensive study takes into account a wide range of possible risks and suggests how to combat the disease in areas such as transmission from one site to another, safety measures to reduce escape of salmon, treatment of waste and effluent, methods of detection and diagnosis, breeding and rotation, disinfection of equipment, etc. Some of these measures will be implemented immediately by local authorities using the tools at their disposal, while others will be reflected in codes of practice. All of these measures will serve not only to combat infectious salmon anaemia, but also to achieve higher standards of quality in aquaculture in general, where necessary. Ladies and gentlemen, by voting in favour of my proposal as approved by the Fisheries Committee, you will enable the introduction of a broader package of disease control legislation in Scotland based on the reality of the situation in Scotland and the positive experiences of other countries. I congratulate Mr Hudghton, fully support his report and ask Members of this Parliament to do the same. As the rapporteur has said, fish farming is an important source of employment in some remote parts of rural Scotland. At a time when these areas are experiencing the worst recession in a hundred years, the aquaculture industry provides a vital boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of jobs depend directly and indirectly. Currently, as the rapporteur said, more than 85,000 tonnes of salmon are produced on Scottish farms: it is an industry that brings in more than €800 million each year.	it
"Amendment 16 endangers investor protection, because the prohibition on the provision of collateral with the depositary is a contradiction in terminis. Securities lending transactions carried out through clearing houses or stock exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - are also not automatically covered by these institutions. For this reason, we cannot accept the proposed amendment. Amendment 42 concerns a provision that has not been changed by the proposal and has not caused any problems since the implementation of the Directive. I therefore see no reason to delete Article 22(3) and therefore reject the amendment. Amendment 44 cannot be accepted, because if it is stipulated that non-harmonised funds must apply the ""Directive"" rules on borrowing and lending, purchases made in an unhedged position and the depositary, only very few funds, such as Swiss funds, could be considered for investment purposes. This is in conflict with the Commission's objective of broadening the range of investments and the wording of the amendment could violate the General Agreement on Trade in Services. Amendment 47 is unacceptable as regards the proposed changes to paragraph 1 of Article 22a, because it is in total conflict with the distribution rules of Article 22, especially where UCITS are obliged to indicate a reference point in their prospectuses, as decided by the Council. The main problem with the first proposal, however, is the amendment tabled by the Parliament allowing over-the-counter instruments to be used for generic investment purposes. The Commission draws attention to the fact that, under the legislation in force in some Member States, the use of OTC derivatives for generic investment purposes is already permitted. The Commission also expresses reservations in view of the higher intrinsic risks associated with these investments compared to more traditional financial instruments. I think that OTC instruments could cause problems, as they are illiquid, difficult to price and involve uncovered risks for the counterparty. It does not seem appropriate to take an overly cautious approach to investments such as non-harmonised funds or deposits, and at the same time allow much riskier investments in OTC instruments. By rejecting the rapporteur's Amendment No 39, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has taken the same line as the Council. The adoption of this amendment tabled by Parliament would have the effect of theoretically allowing funds to invest in OTC instruments and to trade participation rights in their funds throughout the internal market. In practice, access to other Community markets for these theoretically harmonised funds investing in OTC instruments could be blocked due to the application of different national regulations and protective measures against OTC investments. This would be in conflict with the fact that Community legislation covers all funds investing in OTC instruments. In view of this possible negative consequence for the internal market and the inherent risks of OTC instruments, the Commission cannot accept amendments Nos 12, 15, 37, 38, 39, 43, 46 and 48 and parts of amendments Nos."	it
You answered it the way I knew you would. I would like to link it to something Mr. Goodwill asked, namely our relationship between the precautionary principle and the world outside the European Union. I'm not asking that without reason. You rightly said that the precautionary principle is necessary precisely when science has yet to provide any evidence. How do we ensure that we don't make ourselves vulnerable at any time, for example, to our partners in the USA – and the Biosafety Protocol isn't enough in that case? How do we ensure that our colleagues in industrial policy and foreign trade policy don't keep kicking your heels in, like they did with your predecessors the last few times? That's precisely what it's about; otherwise, there's no need to talk about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner! Mr. President! I consider it very important to refer to the guidelines contained in this communication that apply to the application of the precautionary principle, in order to counter claims that we always apply it for protectionist reasons. I am convinced that we will have to deal with even more conflicts in the future, for example with the USA. It would be naive to believe otherwise. However, since the signing of the Montreal Protocol, we have had international confirmation and a common definition enshrined in a protocol on the environment, health, and trade. This can therefore be seen as a good example. We must be prepared for conflicts to arise in the future, but now we can demonstrate that we are not applying the precautionary principle arbitrarily. We now have a set of guidelines for this, clearly laid down in the communication, as well as strong popular support. Thank you, Commissioner. Due to the attention paid to the principle of political precaution, we have discussed it for almost two hours, and now this issue is considered more of a matter of day-to-day administration, although, as we have seen from the contributions and the questions and answers, it is a matter of great importance. The debate is closed. Intergovernmental Conference The next item is the report (A5-0018/2000) by Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos and Jo Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference (14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)). Mr President, I would first like to thank the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for the many extremely useful contacts I have had recently. I would also like to thank my co-rapporteur, Mr Leinen, for his excellent cooperation. The forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is important both in general and specifically with regard to the coming enlargement. The way Europe will be structured and function in the 21st century will depend on the discussions it holds. In order to make the processes in the future European Union more efficient, more democratic and transparent in every respect, a comprehensive and far-reaching reform of its institutions and the way they work is understandably necessary. The first and most important prerequisite for the success of this reform is the agenda on which the Intergovernmental Conference will begin its work. The agenda agreed at the Helsinki Summit is insufficient and offers no guarantee that the necessary and fundamental changes will be implemented to create a more functional, efficient, democratic, and transparent Europe.	de
"The Commission, ladies and gentlemen, will, for its part, take initiatives to initiate and enrich this public debate. Cross-border services Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must first apologize that my voice has already sounded a little harsh today, but as Austrian Members of Parliament, we have had a lot to explain and talk about today. I would first like to thank the Commission most sincerely for the initiative it has taken and for these two draft directives that we are debating here today. In doing so, it closes two serious gaps in the internal market that are of great importance to the European economy and to the 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are employed or self-employed here. The current situation, and this should be borne in mind again, is such that there are judgments from the European Court of Justice in the area of employees, in particular the judgment in the Rush Portuguesa and van der Elst case. They have clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow third-country nationals to be employed as workers for cross-border services, even without obtaining work permits. However, the European Court of Justice did not explicitly address the issue of visa and residence requirements, and the Member States were subsequently unable to clarify this issue. Even with regard to the abolition of work permits, not all Member States have adhered to the Court's rulings and still maintain a multitude of inadmissible barriers to cross-border services – barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for smaller companies. For the self-employed, the current Community acquis does not provide for a right for third-country nationals to provide cross-border services. In any case, a legislative act is required here. Both draft directives aim to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU companies. They are not about original rights for third-country nationals modeled on freedom of movement. All regulations, including entry and residence issues, are to be viewed as accessory to this freedom to provide services. I, along with the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market of the European Parliament, therefore believe that the legal bases chosen by the Commission are correct and that the opposing opinion expressed in the opinion of the Council's Legal Service is incorrect. I therefore see no real legal obstacle to the expeditious further consideration of both draft directives in the Council. I also believe that the amendments proposed by Parliament should facilitate the adoption of the directives in the Council compared to the Commission's proposal. Many of our amendments stem from concerns that were also expressed in the Council, and we are trying to reconcile these concerns with the mandate given to us by applicable law and economic common sense. Especially with regard to acceptance in the Council, I can only appeal to the Commission to adopt the amendments adopted by Parliament as completely as possible, even if they deviate significantly from the Commission's original proposals. I am firmly convinced that we can more easily reach agreement in the Council on this basis. Now for the most important changes we propose. A key difference is that instead of a ""services pass plus notification of each individual contract"" system, we no longer provide for the possibility of requiring prior notification to the receiving state for each individual contract."	de
"This morning there were seven helicopters, and naturally, those helicopters only operate in the Gaza region. The Saave River also has enormous flooding problems, but so far no one has gone there. Eighty-five percent of the work is located within an hour of Maputo, so we have no idea of the scale of the problem. I would also like to say, Commissioner, that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing. Most of us here would not like to boast about €3 million. We must do much more, and I hope the Commissioner will return with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate the efforts being made in the area. It is clear that high-capacity air transport is also needed, in addition to, as you say, tons of food, water purification equipment, tents, and blankets. Are we really prepared for the next phase of relief and rehabilitation you referred to? Because this, too, will require enormous resources. Are we prepared to provide those resources? Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world, yet it is also one of the best examples of overcoming obstacles found in Africa. Its achievements include economic growth, poverty reduction, and democracy, despite the enormous pressures of debt. Mozambique is a wonderful example, but it may now suffer enormous hardship as a result of what it has had to endure. What we should now analyze is how far the catastrophe will set Mozambique back, and that depends entirely on the quality and quantity of international aid that this stricken country receives. Thank you very much, Mrs. Kinnock. Mr. Nogueira, I must tell you that we have noted your interest and concern about this issue, but your group is not registered to speak, and I will abide by the Rules of Procedure. The debate is closed. Economy of the Union (1999) The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission document: ""Situation of the economy of the European Union in 1999"" (C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)). The Commission's report presents a encouraging assessment of the current situation of the European economy, particularly in terms of the recent recovery in economic growth, which is expected to lead to a reduction in unemployment to 8% by 2001. In the view of your rapporteur, this picture contrasts with the background of sluggishness and an annual growth rate of barely 1.9% during the 1990s, with the exception of isolated instances of higher growth rates during that decade, which, however, could not be consolidated. It could be inferred that if we do not want to repeat the same failures of the past, we must seize this opportunity offered by increased economic performance to launch a new policy of transition toward higher levels of sustainable growth for our economy. That is the challenge. Faced with this challenge, the Commission essentially recommended that our economic policy should simply extend our past position, which was limited to correcting the monetary and fiscal foundations of the economy, while for everything else we relied on the markets to perform the miracle without any further intervention by socially conscious agents."	es
Is there any colleague who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group to present the request? Madam President, I do indeed owe Mr. Wurtz an explanation, and I will give it to the entire Parliament. We had reached this agreement in principle at the Conference of Presidents. At that time, I was unaware that Commissioner Mr. Bolkestein would appear next week to speak on this issue before the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism. The issue has been discussed in my group and we believe that, given the current situation in the entire process of market integration and deregulation on such a sensitive issue, it is appropriate for Parliament, regardless of what it does in the future, to have an initial statement so that Commissioner Mr. Bolkestein can take note and guide the debate next week. Madam President, I would like, without further ado, to ask our colleague Mr. Wurtz to reread what this is about. This is not a substantive disagreement, but simply the following question: When will the Commission finally be in a position to present the directive after having already had three and a half years to do so? What we want with the resolution is simply for the promised deadlines to finally be met, and in this regard, it is important that we act as quickly as possible. For this reason, I would like to support the Social Democrats' request for the vote to take place on Friday. (Parliament agrees) Madam President, the Cederschiöld report has certainly been withdrawn from Thursday's agenda. For this reason, we should have a little more time on Thursday. Since we are very short on time on urgent matters due to the large number of items we have to deal with in an hour and a half, I would simply like to ask whether the sitting service could check whether we could have an extra half hour for urgent matters, so that there would be sufficient speaking time. In my opinion, the running of the sessions in recent weeks has seemed a bit chaotic. We were very short on speaking time, and suddenly, last Thursday, we had a time slot of between an hour and an hour and a half, during which no matter was on the agenda, and we had to wait for the vote. On Friday of this week, we have only one item. This is, admittedly, absurd. I would really like to ask for a review of the management of the part-session. This is quite possible: let's see if we can extend the emergency sitting for another half hour, taking into account the withdrawal of Mrs. Cederschiöld's report. This is the sole and exclusive purpose of this. Madam President, I wanted to speak in relation to an item on Wednesday's agenda, which the Honorable Member has not announced.	es
Let me give you an example. The European Union rightly granted aid to the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg, even though its 5,000 jobs have now been reduced to just 700. But these jobs are competitive, as the steelworks is currently the second-largest producer of tool steel in the Federal Republic of Germany. Those who are now jeopardizing the production of this steelworks by demanding the repayment of this aid are threatening not only the steelworks but also an employer in that region, on whom, of course, several small and medium-sized enterprises also depend. This, of course, cannot be the European Union's competition policy. If we want competition, we must succeed in combining political and economic requirements with the requirements of business economics. This is, moreover, the only way to establish regional economic networks in underdeveloped regions, which make it possible to provide social security for people and improve their purchasing power. As part of this approach, we must also take more decisively into consideration demand-side economic policy rather than focusing exclusively on supply-side economic policy. Mr. President, since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994, I have never seen a report with such anti-Irish statements and overtones as the Jonckheer report we are debating today. I would like to quote the following from the report: The highest levels of state aid per capita are allocated to Italy, Germany, and Ireland. If we group together national and Community regional and social funds, Ireland clearly occupies the top spot. I believe the rapporteur is simply playing with figures. I find it difficult to understand how he can include regional and social funds in that mathematical equation. I would like to remind the honourable Member that the European Union has approved the new guidelines on regional aid for the period beginning in 2000. This was a simple extension of the policy objectives aimed at completing the internal market in Europe. For the internal market to succeed and prosper, regional disparities must be reduced. I welcome the fact that, starting in 2000, a 40% grant and a 15% supplement for fixed investment by SMEs will be allowed for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe. I must remind Mr. Jonckheer that Irish or foreign companies based in Ireland still have to cross two seas to reach the continental European market. No other Member State is at such a disadvantage. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the cartel ban is at the heart of a functioning competition system in Europe. The Commission finds the way in which the monitoring of this ban has been carried out in practice unsatisfactory, with which we can also initially agree. However, opinions are beginning to diverge regarding the solution. The Commission's proposal does not formally deviate from the cartel prohibition, but the result is a shift from prohibition with a reservation of authorization to authorization with a reservation of prohibition. This amounts to shifting from the principle of prohibition to the principle of abuse.	es
"The report itself contains good intentions, but, as is often the case when we deal with these issues, it lacks clarity of purpose and a solid basis for its operation. This is why my group and I are proposing three key amendments and additional proposals to the text, not with the intention of removing everything from the proposal, but rather to make it more relevant to those who must implement it. I would like to explain our thoughts here. First, we are concerned about the proper use of the Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds. Past experience dictates that, as elected representatives of European taxpayers, we must and should demand financial integrity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money. Our amendments and additional proposals therefore relate to achieving what we refer to as ""value for money"" indicators in the grant-making process. Second, we have seen too often huge amounts of money spent on projects whose results are necessarily vague at the initial stage of the program period. But all too often, at the midpoint or end of that period, there is no real way to terminate the project if its effectiveness has not been demonstrated. Therefore, our additional proposals advocate for the provision of practical and enforceable exit strategies so that we can not only have the required insurance against incurred costs that are typically charged to the taxpayer, but also avoid the well-known syndrome of losing more money trying to recover what has already been lost. Finally, we advocate for a change in the balance and method of disbursement of funds. There must be greater engagement from the private sector, which must present financial reality as an element of the funding equation. Also, the type of projects funded requires a move away from small-scale, revenue-based projects, which are difficult to monitor, toward capital plans where, in most cases, we can all clearly see the benefits. In this way, the much-vaunted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to unnecessarily resort to the local tax base as late as possible in the areas where these projects are being developed will diminish, and the European Parliament will show that it takes the need for this reform seriously. If the House supports the introduction of these changes to the report today, I believe that they will move us to a further stage, in which the historic objectives that the funds are meant to fulfill will be achieved: that is, to provide financially sustainable assistance to the most needy areas of the European Union whose standard of living requires an increase, not by giving them a handout, but by giving them a boost. I ask the House to support these changes. Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report; it is a difficult and conscientious piece of work. There is no doubt that the European Union's structural policies and cohesion policy are the primary tools for creating the conditions that make development possible and for the progressive elimination of economic and social inequalities between regions. Inequalities that, despite the progress made, remain at very high levels—intolerably high, specifically with regard to unemployment."	es
This makes me anxious, because that is where social exclusion stems, at least in part, from. I don't see how you intend to suggest possible solutions with such considerations. My question, which I repeat here, is: what is the Portuguese Presidency's position on the demands made, for example, by the networks to combat poverty and social exclusion, such as the separation of work and social security, the application of tax policy, particularly to speculative financial capital, and a policy of income redistribution? I would therefore ask you to tell me what the Portuguese Presidency's position is on this and whether it intends to take any action in this direction. Mr. President, you must understand that the real possibilities for a Presidency to reverse global social or economic trends in the six months of its term of office are effectively limited. It is certainly clear that in this regard we are also very closely bound by the logic underlying the Commission's own intervention through its right of initiative. I spoke about the special European Council summit and the initiative that Portugal had to implement, and I also spoke about the future, because there are two complementary approaches to this problem of social exclusion: one is the comprehensive set of direct measures that must be taken to counteract its concrete consequences; the other is the creation of conditions for international competitiveness that will allow us to improve the economic structure within the European Union itself, with a positive impact on the problems of social exclusion. And that is why the Portuguese Presidency has no magic formulas for answering, in six months, questions that have always existed. It is ready to act on all matters that fall within the Community's competence, starting from proposals from the Commission in these areas. It is, of course, able and interested in promoting all the measures proposed, particularly by non-governmental organizations, but also within the framework of conventional intergovernmental cooperation in these fields. However, Mr President, it must be borne in mind that, in an area with such serious financial implications, it is not possible to work exclusively with measures that a Presidency can propose in a six-month period. Therefore, we consider all the measures we have referred to in relation to longer-term strategies - although we are also aware that some homeless people may have died after a long period, that is true - to be measures that can ensure sustainable policies within the European Union. And we will try to contribute to these strategies as best we can during our term of office. Question No 12 by (H-0801/99): Subject: Portuguese Presidency and development policy. Can the President-in-Office of the Council outline the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy, the Lomé Convention and the response to famine? I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his detailed answer to my question and also express my gratitude to the Minister who explained his position to the Committee on Development and Cooperation last week in Brussels. However, not all issues have been resolved. The current program does not appear to give the fight against AIDS a special priority.	de
We cannot but hope that the extraordinary conference will truly meet the high expectations it has raised. Indeed, as you have already emphasized, we do not need one procedure after another, one formality after another, but rather we need facts by which the population of the European Union can measure the usefulness and added value of the European Union's actions. For this reason, you have also rightly grouped together employment, economic reform, growth, and social cohesion and made them the main issue. It is important that all actors in the governments and the Commission pull together in the direction of full employment. Then it will be possible to convince all actors in economic policy of the need to maintain a consistent approach, something that still does not exist. Europe should not lament the success of the American economy or the strength of the dollar without drawing a lesson for itself. Reforms of financial services, services capital, and labor markets are certainly useful and necessary. However, these reforms will not give growth the driving force necessary to organize a high-level, sustainable growth that will have an impact on employment. We experienced this many times in the 1990s. Under conditions of an average productivity increase of 2%, a growth rate of 3.5% is necessary to achieve full employment within ten years. This is very close. For this reason, full employment must indeed be at the top of the agenda. We must set a growth target of at least 3%. The goal of full employment cannot be achieved through economic policy alone. The Europe of innovation and the information society must contribute to this goal. However, for now, we are very far from this. We must also consider that we need a different form of economic policy and economic practice. It cannot simply be that shareholders or the boards of directors of public limited companies decide alone about jobs and the economy, about the development of stock prices. When 13-year-olds play computer games after school, trying to change their parents' stock positions, it may have more to do with a casino than with responsibility. I believe that the extraordinary Lisbon summit will set a signal for responsible economic practice in the European Union. Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. President of the Commission, the Portuguese Presidency has presented an ambitious project for the extraordinary summit. Congratulations. I also welcome the support that Portugal is receiving from the Commission, not least through the communication that it wants to make the Community an information society for all. What Christian Democrat Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said about the Luxembourg employment summit in 1997 also applies to the Lisbon Summit: it must not be a summit of literature, and by this he was referring to the numerous non-binding declarations at many summit meetings. Through the Luxembourg procedure, the Heads of Government achieved concrete successes.	es
"I thank the rapporteur, Mr Karl von Wogau, for his commitment and welcome the reflections he has put forward. I would also like to express my appreciation for the views and observations sent to me by Professor Tesauro, President of the Italian Competition Authority, which Professor Monti will certainly take due account of in a very cooperative spirit. The real problem undoubtedly lies in greater liberalization of the market and, above all, in the unification of the various national markets, which currently display considerable differences that are clearly evident when comparing the English, Italian, and French markets. The French market, for example, is characterized by strong elements of state protectionism, which do not exist in the English market and are extremely limited in Italy. Another problem is posed by the economies of the candidate countries, which, without gradual adjustment, risk being permanently dependent on support. I also believe that a threshold should be set below which two important elements, characteristic of our economic fabric, must be integrated: SMEs, which are the pillar of the European economy, and the social protection that Europe has always provided to the economically weaker sections of the population. Respect for the social function of the market is the distinguishing mark between a free economy tout court and a system designed to improve people's quality of life. One aspect that the new legislation must take into account is the economy of the outermost regions and island territories, which must be preserved. I therefore believe that thought should also be given to the creation of two external markets and, to this end, fruitful relations should be established with Russia and the Mediterranean countries so that their economies are less peripheral. I hope—and I thank Professor Monti for this—that the new legislation will be given as much economic character as possible while safeguarding its social function. Mr President, competition is the core and strength of Europe's internal market policy. A free, open market can only exist thanks to competition that is constrained by clear, uniform rules. Mr. Karl von Wogau sums this up in his report. But Europe is changing. Economies are growing, and soon we will have 25 to 30 Member States. The European Commission will be overwhelmed with work if it continues to pursue its current policy. Therefore, competition policy must be modernized. There is no doubt about that. Nevertheless, the proposed decentralization worries me. How will the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, ensure that competition matters are decided uniformly in London, Palermo, Helsinki, and soon also in Budapest and Ankara? Legal inequality must be avoided, and the court that hands down the most lenient sentences must not be inundated with competition policy matters. Simply pointing out that the Member States can look back on 40 years of experience is not enough. In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy. The country has a very small market, which, unfortunately, is often defined as the relevant market. Germany, with its extremely experienced antitrust authority, is facing this challenge and commands a gigantic market. We Catholics call the European Commission's confidence that legislation will, almost naturally, be interpreted in the same way in all directions ""bold confidence,"" and that is forbidden."	de
"This symbolizes the need for solidarity with the countries of the South, particularly those of Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific, which also appealed to us in Seattle on this issue. To fully achieve its objective, the redistribution of the money supply freed up by such a tax must necessarily go to the poorest countries. In this way, we give meaning to the moralization of trade rules and to solidarity with the peoples of the South. Madam President, not only must we continually repeat the figure that many previous speakers have already mentioned, but it must also be mentioned, Commissioner, that 80% of these gigantic daily foreign exchange transactions have a deposit period of no more than eight days. Investment and job creation cannot be less lucrative than short-term currency and stock transactions. We cannot allow the possibilities for political shaping to be taken away from us, nor can we allow income from non-economic activity to grow ever more rapidly. Since Tobin developed his idea, in Germany, the proportion of cash wealth has almost doubled from 7.6% of total income. It cannot be accepted that the poorest countries on Earth are those most intensely subject to the speculative struggles of short-term currency fluctuations. Nor do I believe it is impractical. Why shouldn't it be possible to reach an agreement among the G7 states, the other EU states, China, Singapore, and Switzerland on the introduction of the Tobin tax? There must be a general economic interest. Why can't it be feasible—since it is identifiable—for transactions for the immediate exchange of foreign currencies, all so-called cash transactions, foreign exchange transactions, and forward option transactions to be subject to this tax? Why can't it be feasible to determine the amount of this tax in such a way that it does not jeopardize necessary long-term economic investments but ultimately makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive? Undoubtedly, many difficult issues will arise, but the only major problem I see so far is political will and this attitude of shifting responsibility from one place to another. Mr. President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr. Karas pointed out a few minutes earlier. We are looking for solutions. Of course, capital markets need transparency—that is the idea. The Tobin tax will bring some clarity to a very obscure issue. ""The more progress is made towards trade liberalization, the more rules are needed,"" as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle. He acknowledged that the combined effort of the Single Market and the Single Currency that characterize the process of building the European Union is intimately linked to an enormous number of new rules. Now that financing can be quickly sought across national borders without any difficulty, it will be strictly necessary to employ the same approach, all the more so considering that an enormous amount of financial resources is spent on speculative transactions every day."	es
Secondly, there is a lady who is thirteen weeks away from retirement and is impatient to hear the judgment that will seriously affect her financial situation in her old age. These are just two examples of real-life problems lurking behind delays in the Community justice system. Delays in justice can lead to personal hardship and even tragedy. This is not to say that all our national justice systems are perfect, but all too often they are forced to await a preliminary judgment from the European Court of Justice. Statistics point to a worrying upward trend in the time taken for preliminary references. This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court of Justice or its staff, but rather of its structure and lack of resources in an ever-enlarging European Union. The proposals contained in this report are welcome as an interim palliative, but Europe is a legal construct, and its courts are fundamental to its proper functioning. With a view to the forthcoming enlargement, the Intergovernmental Conference must address a fundamental reform and restructuring of the judicial system. Otherwise, all of us, in our capacity as elected representatives, will increasingly face the clamor of our citizens who lack access to swift and effective justice. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report. Furthermore, I fully agree with the conclusions he has outlined. Specifically, he proposes increasing the number of lawyers per judge at the Court of First Instance and providing that Court with its own translation service. I consider this truly essential, given that during the Committee on Legal Affairs' visit to the courts in Luxembourg, we were told that, logically and naturally, the Court of Justice takes precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the common translation service. The result is that on numerous occasions, cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be properly processed. But on the other hand, I believe that the reforms must go beyond what we are going to agree to here. Thus, for example, I believe we should consider the possibility of making the Court of First Instance the court of last resort, granting it the final say in those areas where adjudicatory bodies, which are similar to courts, make a preliminary decision. It's enough to mention the word Alicante or to recall that this procedure is planned to be applied in the area of European civil service law. And it seems to me that we will probably also have to take measures in response to the European Commission's tendency to renationalize competition decisions, referring them to the national level. This matter is worthy of reflection since, in this way, such cases will no longer end up before the Court of First Instance, but will be dealt with by the Court of Justice as referral orders. We must find a way out of this situation. If necessary, we could also consider submitting referral orders in competition matters to the specialized chamber of the Court of First Instance.	es
"I particularly expect the Portuguese Presidency to take advantage of the enormous work of the Finnish Presidency to present proposals and coordinated action plans among the Member States. At the international level, action plans are already in place to combat scourges such as drug trafficking and money laundering. On a more human scale, however, much remains to be done: first, to help those trying to get out of drugs and provide them with the appropriate controls and mechanisms for their reintegration; second, to ensure coordination between police forces and judicial systems regarding common sentences and legal provisions; third, to conduct an information and awareness-raising campaign aimed at young people; and fourth, to eliminate once and for all these very dangerous notions of ""normalization"" and ""harm reduction"" and to show that any weakening of our resolve to fight drug legalization must be in the interest of all. Mr President, I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time I have to point out or remind the Commission representative that the Belgian Government is currently pursuing a policy that will enable thousands, even tens of thousands, of illegal aliens to be regularised and granted permanent residence, family reunification, and so on. This measure by the Belgian Government constitutes a flagrant breach of the Schengen Convention. On 23 December, I submitted a written complaint on this matter to Commissioner Vitorino. I would like to ask him to examine this complaint and to inform me as soon as possible of the measures that the Commission will adopt to sanction the Belgian State's violation of the Schengen Convention, pursuant to Article 226 of the Treaty. Mr President, dear Portuguese friends and, in particular, dear representatives of the Council, you are faced with great expectations from us. I would like to show you, by way of an example, how you can respond relatively quickly to these expectations, at least partially. This is Eurodac. You will recall that in December, this European Parliament decided, full of hope, that Eurodac should become a reality as a regulation and a system, also as a Community instrument that we urgently needed to no longer allow multiple asylum applications, to have an instrument against illegality and, above all, to establish beyond doubt which Member State was responsible for a specific asylum procedure. We clearly declared ourselves in favour of this instrument, accompanied by an implementation committee and a suitable database established within the Commission. We believed that Eurodac should become a reality. In Tampere, too, they believed that Eurodac should become a reality. But since the follow-up Summit held in December, the Council has embarked on a different path and taken a further step backwards by deciding - which we resolutely rejected - to maintain the executive powers within the Council, to attach the Implementation Committee to the Council and perhaps to use Gibraltar as a means of pressure."	fr
From this perspective, the issue must be investigated, because the instability of the Caucasus can lead many to think inappropriately. Second, regarding the safety of the facilities. In regions of high seismic risk, it is not enough to have earthquake-resistant buildings, because in exceptional cases—and I am speaking to you as an engineer—we use models to investigate the consequences of certain hazards. However, we cannot create models with operating nuclear facilities. It is impossible. In this sense, in high-risk regions, a priori, nuclear power plants are not built. Given this, as Turkey is on the doorstep of the European Union, we must help it become a country of security, peace, and cooperation in the region. This is our role, and this is the objective of my question. Mr. President, I recognize the relevance of the arguments put forward by the Honorable Member. In reality, this is a very delicate issue. Furthermore, as you will understand, this is an issue that concerns not only Turkey in terms of its proximity to the current territory of the European Union, but also other states with which we have a relationship within the framework of our own closeness. We understand the Honourable Member's concern and will not fail to take it into account, particularly in the context of the future contacts we will hold with Turkey when formulating the agenda for the accession strategy planned for that country. This issue will also be at the heart of our concerns, and the European Commission will not fail to take it into account. Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, President-in-Office of the Council. I am convinced that the President-in-Office of the Council is a very pleasant person and is very affable with his wife, his children, and his dog. However, allow me to be somewhat suspicious of the answer you have just given us. I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes will be made available to the public immediately. Therefore, will you undertake, before the next plenary session in February, to tell me in writing where I can find this information on behalf of the public, immediately after the Council has adopted a legislative act, rather than waiting for it to be published weeks later in a press release? Will you send me this information in writing before the next plenary session? Your Honor, first of all, I would like to say that I excuse the personal comments with which you began your second question, and if you could refrain from making them in the future, I would appreciate it. Regarding what the Honorable Member has said, it gives us an idea that the criticism of the Council, in addition to being formulated very specifically and of which we also take note, does not refer to the opacity—let's say so—of the legislative process, but almost to an excess of transparency. But I would like to tell you, Your Honor, that the results of this type of transparency process are, for us, clear and we consider them beyond doubt.	es
Since 1998, the Commission has received complaints alleging that the port facilities will damage the Stegrennan Coastal Strip, which is currently part of the Special Area of Conservation, and that protection standards have not been met. After analyzing these complaints throughout 1998 and early last year (the project did not receive Structural Fund funding during this period), the Commission was satisfied in the summer of 1999 that the port works had met protection standards. A thorough study of the environmental consequences was conducted. The most negative effect of the project, the loss of the Stegrennan Coastal Strip, will be temporary, and the developers are responsible for restoring it. At the Commission's request, the Stegrennan Coastal Strip was formally added to the Boyne Estuary Special Protection Area, from which it had previously been excluded. To offset the negative effects of the temporary disappearance of the coastal strip on the life of wild birds, it was considered to improve other suitable habitats for these birds in the estuary area. However, since the summer of last year, this measure has been called into question. First, the Irish authorities withdrew their commitment to make improvements. Later, they renewed their commitment after protests were lodged by an environmental non-governmental organization in the Irish courts. The new commitment, however, contained minor changes that, in turn, gave rise to further protests. Considering that Ireland has committed to adopting compensatory measures and that other issues have already been resolved, the Commission, for the time being, does not wish to propose freezing the Structural Funds. However, the Commission wishes to examine the compensatory measures of the Irish authorities, especially those relating to habitat improvement, in light of the still unfinished proceedings before the Irish courts. I did not fully understand what the Commissioner said. The Stregrennan Mudflat, which was declared a special protection area at the request of the Commission, has already been completely destroyed. It is clear that the activities carried out there clearly violate EU directives. You state that no further funding will be granted. I would like to know whether it is proposed to suspend funding completely at this stage, pending a proper investigation. If not, why not? If it is proposed to suspend funding, when exactly will it do so? Is it right and proper that the corporation that owns the company is also responsible for granting the license, as well as essentially receiving the EU funds and handing them over to a company that it 100% owns? Is that right and appropriate? What is your view on this? All funding for the project must be stopped because it clearly violates EU directives. Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed. Further compensation will not repair the damage caused.	es
Unfortunately, nothing is changing now and nothing will change in the future. You want to drive out the devil with Beelzebub and apply the same disastrous methods and the same economic principles to areas that have previously been beyond your jurisdiction: education, wage policy, direct taxation, labor law, social protection, and social assistance. The most extraordinary thing about all this is the fact that this policy of social cuts is largely being pursued by left-wing governments of various stripes—pink, red, green—who preach social justice during election campaigns but pursue general social cuts once they are in power. At this point, I would like to reiterate our conviction that without national and European priority, and without protecting our markets from unbridled global competition, no social policy and no policy of full employment are possible. When it comes to jobs, social protection, family, or pension policy, we must think of the Europeans first. The economic globalization you are promoting is neither necessary nor inevitable. This globalization is being imposed by force by the only superpower to survive the Cold War and by multinational corporations, which are becoming independent economic powers that are subjugating states, nations, and peoples unable to defend themselves to their economic will. You are thus complicit in this development. You are promoting this process, you are collaborating with it, and, despite your announcements, you are in fact promoting the disintegration of our social protection systems. You are creating insecurity and organizing social cuts. This economic globalization, especially in the form in which it is taking place today—that is, without taking into account the social and national characteristics of each state—could be disastrous for the European social model. Your rush toward extreme liberalism will certainly not solve the social problems, the problems of insecurity, and the employment problems of millions upon millions of Europeans. Mr. President, we will once again hear many fine words at the Lisbon Summit. We'll gladly listen to these words, but they won't change the fundamental problem: that we have an Economic and Monetary Union that prioritizes combating inflation over employment. The Central Bank has announced that the rate of price increases must never exceed 2%. The Stability Pact states that the budget deficit may not exceed 1% in normal years. However, there is no requirement that unemployment be lower than 5%, or—even better—lower than 2% or 1%. What's more important is that the price of money and public spending must not rise. It's conceivable that a country might want to combat unemployment with public investment, but that's forbidden. Monetary policy should remain a sacred cow; it's more important than providing jobs for the unemployed. For me, on the other hand, it's more important that the family budget is in order, that Dad gets paid, not be laid off. That was the attitude of the Danish government formed in 1993. In 1992, unemployment stood at 9.2% in Euroland, i.e., in the 11 countries, and also in Denmark. Between 1992 and 1998, the unemployment rate in Denmark fell to 5.1%. In Euroland, it rose to 10.9%.	de
Let me give you an example. In the 1998 Court of Auditors' report, a miscalculation in exchange rates for Italian wine cost European taxpayers £8 million to £10 million. This is clearly unacceptable. What about the person responsible for the miscalculation? We need a system of bonuses and promotions, and these promotions must be based on merit. We recognize that most Commission officials are hard workers. But we also note that some practices are outdated. We eagerly await the Commission's full proposal on reform and hope that we can work out the details together, since, contrary to what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has undertaken to discuss this with Parliament by 1 March. We must also recognize that those who live in glass houses should not throw stones. The European Parliament has not always been very clear in its approach throughout its history. We also have a long way to go before we reach perfection. Our personnel policy itself is outdated. Some of our working practices need to be radically changed. I hope that Parliament will remain in the Commission's wake throughout this reform process. We share the proposals for activity-based budgeting. We recognize that this requires discipline on the part of Commission officials, and we also recognize that, in Parliament, we are responsible for discipline when we talk about negative priorities. Finally, I would add that the Commission needs to review its relationship with citizens. European taxpayers need to be reassured. The fate of the Commission and the European Union as a whole rests on the delivery of this reform. That is the key issue: the delivery of these proposals. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr. Van Hulten, on his first report. I have particular admiration for his courage, which he continued to display when he was buried under amendments. I believe that the report by the Wise Men was useful, particularly for Parliament - as Mrs Morgan said - and that we were right to seek the advice of independent experts on how to run our administration. We have tabled an amendment on this subject. I would like to emphasise a few of the many points in Mr Van Hulten's report, not on the basis of their importance but on the basis of an arbitrary selection. I believe, first of all, that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper preservation of documents. The Commission's archives leave a lot to be desired. We saw this when we had to investigate the Fléchard affair, which has still not been clarified. Strangely, very important documents had disappeared from the offices, even from that of the President and from various Directorates-General, and this is something that, obviously, cannot happen.	fr
"Finally, I support the European Commission's desire to formulate an ambitious objective in the fight against poverty to drastically reduce this scourge within a decade. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe it is essential to set an objective that challenges all Member States to fight against the social exclusion of all citizens from our society, not only children but also their parents and the elderly. I wish the Council Presidency good luck in realising its ambitions. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President, the extraordinary European Council in Lisbon on employment, economic reform and social cohesion will, as we have seen, pursue an ambitious objective, a very ambitious one, at the risk of disappointing our fellow citizens, who are aware that it is not enough to decree full employment and the eradication of poverty in Europe to make it a reality. However, this summit has a significant merit: that of defining, after Cardiff and Luxembourg, the political will to ensure clearer social cohesion, especially with regard to the 57 million people who live in poverty in our country: among them, single mothers, large families and children, to whom will be added tomorrow still others excluded, that is, those who will not have access to new areas of knowledge, and this will translate into new social imbalances. It is therefore necessary to develop an economic and social policy clearly oriented towards the future, so as to avoid the creation of a gap, in terms of numbers, between the ""info-rich"" and the ""info-poor"", or a digital divide, as one of my colleagues has just called it. It is for this reason that, if on the one hand I think that new technologies represent a formidable vector of integration for our growth, on the other they can only be so if taught from childhood, since, by 2010, one job out of two will be provided by sectors directly linked to information technologies. In this regard, I call for three decisions to be taken at the Lisbon Summit: first, a lifelong learning strategy, with the launching of an agenda for the eradication of child poverty, both economic and intellectual poverty; second, the establishment of the European society, for the benefit of the European research area; third, the establishment of an open method of working and coordination, based on our social and economic policies, with a concerted assessment of our national plans. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is an idea in the Portuguese Presidency's declaration that I like very much, and that is that the strength of our European economy is based on the skills, imagination and creativity - in short, on the knowledge of the people who participate in the economic process in Europe. If we take this idea seriously and really want to elevate it to a political programme, then the policy of social inclusion would no longer need any further justification, because social participation would in itself be the most powerful productive force in our common economy. If that is the case, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we urgently need common objectives, solid and measurable objectives - in a qualitative and quantitative sense - in terms of increasing employment rates, as has also been proposed in the meantime, for example, by the Commission."	it
"I do not believe there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman. There is the question of the legislative basis, on which we have been well advised, and I believe we are on solid ground in that regard. I would like to reiterate that Members who, like the Member who asked the question, have a particular interest in this issue will wish to engage in dialogue on it. It is extremely important, and I understand the Honourable Member's concern. I would like to thank the Commission for what I consider a very positive response. To be sure, I would like confirmation that there is indeed nothing in Jacob Söderman's proposal, regarding the Commission and good administration, that the Commission finds unacceptable. Is it correct that the content of the proposal will be approved in its entirety? Let me read what it says in my notes—and since it is in my notes, it must be true! ""I would like to emphasize again that the Commission has accepted all of the Ombudsman's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999."" Both documents, that is, the Commission's document and the Ombudsman's draft, largely cover the same points. The only important issue that has arisen concerns the legislative basis. I can go into detail if the Honorable Member wishes, but there is no doubt that we are in complete agreement with the Ombudsman on this important issue. We are happy to add Mr. Patten's notes to the bibliography, as another reference book that we Members will take into account. Since its author is not present, Question 32 falls. I apologize to Mr. Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy, which I regret. He is exonerated, according to the Rules of Procedure, from answering. I wish him a very good afternoon. Part Two Questions addressed to Mr. Nielson, replaced by Mr. Patten. Questions 33 and 34 in Part Two of Question Time to the Commission were addressed to Mr. Nielson. Mr. Nielson cannot be present today because he is in South Africa. I must tell you that the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs. Loyola de Palacio, has sent me a very kind letter providing all sorts of explanations and informing me that Mr. Patten will be the one to answer these questions. Question No. 33 by (H-0829/99): Subject: Mainstreaming the gender dimension in EU development aid policy. In 1995, the Council of Ministers drew up guidelines for mainstreaming the gender dimension throughout EU development aid policy. These guidelines require all staff working on development issues to receive ongoing training in equality. However, so far only about 50 people have received such training, and it is still not mandatory within the Directorate-General responsible for this aid. Mainstreaming the equality dimension implies taking equality between women and men into consideration as an integral part of any policy, strategy, or initiative in the field of development. To achieve this objective, the Council's guidelines must be fully implemented."	es
This is the key to ensuring efficiency and security. We will create a management and control system in each Directorate-General. Currently, the control system is centralized throughout; with the reform, we will move to a control system that combines the decentralization of administrative controls with an efficient central audit system. We will therefore have a central financial service that will establish the rules for financial management and provide advice. There will be a decentralization of the entire chain—namely, programs, commitments, contracts, expenditure, and the corresponding ex ante control systems—to the level of each Directorate-General, and there will be an external audit service that will monitor all these operations. This will mean a total overhaul of the Commission's working practices, a completely new organization that also requires a completely new culture. We are fully aware of the problems associated with this transitional period, and it is this transitional period that most worries our staff. We will therefore take the necessary security and protection measures. With this reform, the Commission aims to become an administration that serves as a model for Europe and the world as a whole. We also want to be a model for the advanced use of information technology. We want to set an example of a fully computerized administration. The Commission has been accused of being buried under mountains of paper; we will therefore be a paperless Commission, so that we become more efficient internally and contribute externally to the increased use of new technologies. This will involve not just a technical overhaul, but a complete organizational overhaul. I will now leave it to Neil Kinnock to explain this reform in detail, but not before thanking him for the wisdom, enthusiasm, and energy he has put into this work. I would also like to thank everyone who contributed to this project, as well as all the Commission staff who participated in this most comprehensive discussion process ever undertaken in the Commission. I would like to emphasize that this is an extraordinarily new method of discussion, which, in my opinion, has also forced us to undergo a radical change in our way of thinking. The White Paper before us is also the result of their contribution: they understood that only a profoundly reformed Commission can once again become the institution that was so highly esteemed around the world and which formed the starting point for Europe's history. With the adoption of the White Paper, a chapter of the past will – I hope and wish – be definitively closed. Now we look to the future, to the challenges facing the Union and to all the objectives of the 2000-2005 programme, which we have already explained to you here in recent weeks. These objectives of the five-year programme contain the deeper political reasons for the reform. We – the entire Union – need a strong Commission, a Commission that regains its capacity to act as a political actor, recognizable as such by its actions. That is why we are now redefining all the priorities on which we must focus our work. Therefore - and this is another important chapter - we are getting rid of those activities which, in accordance with the principles of decentralisation and subsidiarity, are no longer appropriate for us to carry out.	de
At the 55th session of the Commission on Human Rights last year, the United States, at an already advanced stage, decided to introduce a draft resolution on China. This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese non-intervention motion. The European Union voted against this motion. The European Union's position on the stance the Commission on Human Rights should take toward China was reaffirmed by the General Affairs Council on March 21, 1999: no European Union initiative regarding China and no support for a Chinese resolution. The European Union rejected the non-intervention motion in the vote. It is uncertain whether the cohesion of the European Union could have been maintained had the resolution been put to a vote. The United States will introduce a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Commission on Human Rights, and is currently pressuring the European Union to approve the draft. This situation provoked strong reactions from China: The Chinese authorities are currently taking steps in the countries and institutions of the European Union to persuade them to withdraw their support for the US initiative. This initiative is being discussed within the Union, but a decision is not expected soon. It is in the interest of the European Union to keep all options open within the framework of the dialogue between the European Union and China on human rights for as long as possible, and in any case until after the meeting on February 25, 2000. In view of the changes that have taken place in the composition of the Human Rights Commission, it is to be expected that the vote on the non-intervention motion will be suspended. It is therefore important that the countries of the European Union agree again this year on the position they will take in a possible vote on the resolution. In this context, it should be noted that the European Union regularly opposes China's requests that the submission of a resolution to the Geneva Human Rights Commission automatically exclude it from the dialogue on human rights. The European Union firmly believes that dialogue, while a very valuable tool for exchanging views and understanding the reasons behind each other's positions, must also produce concrete results on the ground. Failure to do so may require a resolution from the Commission on Human Rights, perhaps later in the dialogue. Furthermore, the European Union has consistently emphasized to China that the Commission on Human Rights is the appropriate forum for raising human rights issues and that, from this perspective, the initiative—whether the European Union chooses to support it or not—is fully justified. The next dialogue on human rights will take place in Lisbon on 25 February and will include seminars on legal issues and women's rights, which are also expected to include representatives from academia and civil society. The next seminar on human rights will be organized by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000. At the last round of dialogue in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the technical assistance offered by the European Union to support the ratification process of the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the Chinese Government is a signatory.	de
"There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters, nor is there any predestined fate. They are the result of human inconsistency. This is an ecological catastrophe. Only those far removed from the harsh realities on the ground can doubt this. It is also an economic catastrophe for all those who live from the sea and tourism, such as fishermen, oyster farmers, mussel farmers, saltworkers, traders, etc. The Erika disaster must be the last in a series. First, the circumstances of this disaster must be fully clarified. Why not set up a parliamentary committee of inquiry or involve Members of Parliament in the mission just announced by the Commission? Then, we must urgently adopt legislation to ensure, above all, the precise characteristics of the goods being transported are recorded. According to experts, the oil on the Erika should have sunk to the bottom and never reached the coast. The consequences are well known. Furthermore, reliable roadworthiness testing must be introduced, similar to the roadworthiness testing required in France for motor vehicles older than five years. Regulations for the use of flags of convenience, the requirement for double hulls on ships carrying polluting and dangerous goods, and technological innovations for the treatment and recovery of mineral oils at sea are also required. In my opinion, this would be a minimum at the beginning of the third millennium. Ships that do not meet compliance requirements must be prohibited from sailing in European waters. At the same time, the liability of those responsible for damage, shipowners, and charterers must be established according to the polluter pays principle. Maritime surveillance must be strengthened to prevent any degassing. Serious and reliable inspection of tankers must be implemented. A well-funded ""natural disasters"" budget line must be established for member states. Special Community aid must be introduced. Affected departments must be designated as eligible for Structural Funds. I have submitted a draft resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD group. Mr. President, in recent years, there have been repeated serious tanker disasters around the world without any significant or effective countermeasures being taken. This time it is particularly bad, not least because it struck a major European country, an incident that could happen again at any time. We urgently need a directive to limit these risks. The 15 directives are clearly not enough. They guarantee – without claiming to be exhaustive – at least three points: No tanker or freighter that is ready for scrap may ever again call at a port in the European Union. All parties involved, including the client of the transport, are liable for consequential damages, and they must take out adequate insurance. Only in this way can the injured parties have a chance of claiming compensation. However, we must be clear that the long-term goal must be even more ambitious. This means we need true cost transparency for our entire energy supply system. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio for her objective, appropriate, and binding response. Thank you very much for that. At the same time, her communication of January 10, as well as the action plan she announced today, commands enormous respect. The Erika disaster proves that when coherent traffic and transport regulations are lacking at the international and European levels, nature and the environment suffer."	de
These are areas that are mutually dependent on each other. Economic stability is a factor of growth and can lead to high employment. This also ensures the possibility of increasing prosperity. But the opposite is also true: a comprehensive social protection policy can contribute to high employment and an increase in the growth rate. In other words, social protection is a productive factor. There are differences in social protection systems within the Union. Many of these differences have historical explanations. But we now have a number of common challenges ahead of us. I am thinking, for example, of a demographic trend in which not only the number of older people is increasing, but also the number of births is falling. The labour market is also changing: women are increasingly venturing into the labour market. Technological developments are another challenge. These are all challenges that we must address together. The Commission communication calls for a more intensive exchange of experience, the creation of a high-level group and benchmarking. Furthermore, the report on social protection in Europe will be published annually and will be examined together with the employment report. This is good, but it is not enough. We propose a procedure similar to the Luxembourg process. Clear guidelines and indicators are needed, and Member States will have to define methodologies in national action plans. A common model is created, but subsidiarity is maintained. This form of social convergence is a process that will continue for a long time. That is why Parliament must be involved in the work, and not by being included in the high-level group, but by allowing representatives of Parliament to follow the work of this group and to make proposals on how to conduct this process. Like cooperation on employment, the Commission's proposal is based on four pillars: making social protection systems more employment-oriented, making pension systems sustainable in the long term, promoting social inclusion, ensuring high-quality healthcare. All this is important. In our report, we have particularly highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the Union and of identifying indicators as soon as possible that will allow progress in this area. There is no specific pillar for gender equality: this is where mainstreaming comes in. Equality aspects must therefore be present in each of the four pillars. This is a fixed point for us. We are presenting a whole series of proposals, for example the transition to personalised social security systems, recognition of the validity of parental leave for the purposes of social benefits, better conditions for reconciling family and professional life, minimum old-age pensions that still allow a decent standard of living. These are proposals that primarily benefit women. In parallel with this European strategy for social convergence, we need a concrete plan for legislative work in the social field and proposals for framework agreements in the context of social dialogue, with a clear timetable.	it
The air, rail, ferry and bus routes that provide external and internal connections in remote areas are put out to tender. The contract is awarded to those who undertake to provide a specific service at a specific quality level with the lowest subsidy. We can call this a negative tender offer. This ensures a competitive offer of service provision, based on a publicly supported but transparent award system. Why couldn't the mail collection and delivery service in a certain region be put out to tender according to these criteria? The tender with the lowest subsidy would be awarded the concession for a certain period of time. Why couldn't the small local office in a remote village be put out to tender according to these criteria? It would then be up to the democratically accountable local, regional or national administrative body - perhaps under the control of the European Union - to set the criteria and the financial resources to be allocated to this particular social purpose. Otherwise, postal services could be left to the mercy of all the demands and constraints of the market. Mr President, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Scottish Member to speak in this debate. It shows how important the issue of postal services is to us. Scotland is larger than some Member States and has many communities living in remote areas, accessible only by road, sometimes poorly served by public transport and sometimes not served at all. These communities rely on local services such as the school, the post office and the one shop for their survival. Older people in particular rely solely on the last two. Often the post office and the shop are the same, and the provision of these two services depends on the existence of both. Scotland also has many island communities: some can be reached by plane, but most are dependent on the ferry connection. It is important to note that the current cost of delivering a letter from Edinburgh to the Central Highlands is about ten times higher than that of delivering the same letter from one end of London to the other, and four times higher than the postal charges currently charged. This difference increases with the distance of the remote area. That is the problem. To ask for liberalisation to take account of these factors, allowing for the maintenance of a universal and affordable postal service is not to oppose it. It is for our remote and island communities that we ask you to maintain the lifeline of postal services. Mr President, it is a privilege for me to deputise for Commissioner Bolkestein in this in-depth debate on postal services, and I will try to respond on the basis of the information he has given me. I would remind you that the Commissioner will be present at the meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on Monday. Some Members, such as Mr Stenmarck, are complaining about the delays in tabling the new proposal.	it
"The time for resolutions is over. What is needed now is action. Regrettably, the Council will once again—I fear—fail to act, and in the future we will once again be debating another maritime and ecological disaster. Mr. President, whenever there is a disaster of this kind, it is said that it must not happen again. In reality, we can never put an end to accidents at sea, but it is incumbent upon us to learn the lessons that emerge whenever an accident of this kind occurs and apply them to reduce risks in the future. The Erika accident was serious, particularly for the people of Brittany most directly affected, but it was devastating for the fauna and flora of much of Europe. Some say it is the worst accident ever to befall birdlife in this part of Europe. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds, perhaps mainly guillemots, may have died. The photographs many of us have seen of oiled birds being euthanized by official veterinarians were both distressing and tragic. We all want the highest standards for ships, regardless of the flag they fly. We must enforce regulations and ensure that the ""polluter pays"" principle is applied so that penalties and also financial incentives are used to put pressure on shipowners and oil companies and ensure the best procedures are introduced. I agree with everything the Commissioner has said in her remarks, but the question is: how long will it take to get the measures to address this problem as she proposes put forward? As a politician, she must remind her officials how difficult it would be if she were to return to this Parliament a year from now, if a similar, equally devastating accident occurred, if some of the measures she has proposed today were still simply fine words and she had not had the opportunity to implement them. The idea that an accident of this kind could happen in the near future must make your mind and those of your officials concentrate intensely. Mr. President, Commissioner, I have brought you a small gift: a cake of heavy oil sent to me by a resident of the island of Noirmoutier, who writes the following: ""With each tide, the beach is covered with heavy oil escaping from the Erika. With each tide, volunteers, soldiers, and firefighters remove immense cakes of this thick, viscous, black tar. When will it be clean again, and when will this devastating accident end?"" Yes, this Erika accident, like that of the Russian ship in Turkey, is unacceptable and intolerable precisely when high technology is at its peak. It is all the more unacceptable that it is occurring twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, despite the fact that it had already been said and repeated on several occasions, ""Never again something like this!"""	es
We need firm, jointly agreed targets for reducing the unemployment rate to 4% in 2010, as the Commission has now proposed, for example. We need to put an end to the logic of ECOFIN ministers who at home reap the praise for their successes in consolidation, while the responsibility for the high unemployment in Europe remains shrouded in fog. I wish you a lot of energy, the support of Parliament and I hope that there will be a commitment to ensure that this Parliament, in future, will have a greater say in matters of economic policy and employment, as the citizens of Europe would like. You would then have found an additional ally for your policy. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it is gratifying and promising to hear in this Chamber, as we have done today, this new strategic objective for the next decade, which consists in transforming the European Union into the most dynamic and competitive economic and social area in the world, based on new technologies, innovation and knowledge, in order to be able to increase levels of economic growth, achieving more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. It is clear that we must redefine Europe's role in the world economy, creating a competitive Europe, paving the way for the creation of more and better jobs, and organising this evolution with a clear strategy of social cohesion. The central role of employment and social policy, at the dawn of this new society, is based on two factors. On the one hand, economic efficiency, since in this new technological context the quality of human resources is crucial. On the other hand, social equality, because, despite the economic recovery we are experiencing, enormous social inequalities persist. Unemployment, social exclusion and the risks of a future imbalance in social security systems are problems that are becoming more acute due to the inevitable challenges arising from globalisation, the ageing of the population, technological progress, demographic decline and the increasing inclusion of women in the world of work. Europe needs to achieve full employment. Full employment suited to the emerging society, with greater opportunities for women and men. European citizens must be able to believe in this project and in this reality; they must not perceive it as something abstract, discussed in Brussels and Strasbourg. We are therefore calling at this time for the transition to a new society, to an economy based on innovation, on the information society and on knowledge. We must learn quickly, create new practices that are more suited to this new society, invest in technological changes but without ever forgetting people and institutions. The Lisbon Summit will be a step forward and we must succeed in renewing the European social model, because only in this way will we achieve increased employment and at the same time greater social cohesion. To this end, we must focus on a series of priority issues: we must improve the effectiveness of active employment policies, strengthen synergies between adaptability, education and lifelong learning, multiply employment in the service sector by facilitating entrepreneurial initiative and lightening the administrative burden on small and medium-sized enterprises by reducing non-wage costs - and finally we must develop the integration of equal opportunities into general policies, with particular attention to aspects that help to reconcile professional and family life.	it
In the last speech of Mr Solana to this House, I strongly criticised the fact that he barely mentioned the concept of conflict prevention; he spoke at length today on this subject, but did not put forward any proposals for seriously addressing it. The ability to prepare 60,000 men in 60 days for a year's deployment has been proudly trumpeted, but there are crises raging on our continent, on its borders and elsewhere, in which the Union has given a very poor account of itself. We actually need a civilian police force of 60,000 men and women to deal with these situations. Mr Solana has not yet told us what pressure will be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya. He has not even informed us what kind of diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is seriously going to try to stop the massacre in Chechnya. It is not even clear what our human rights objectives in principle are. We have somehow gathered the strength to intervene in Kosovo, but now we are ruining everything because we are not able to muster the necessary resources and personnel there, and we are demonstrating our inability to carry out adequate conflict prevention. I therefore ask Mr Solana to clarify to this Parliament the position of the European Union towards Chechnya. What are we going to do to put an end to this tragedy? We have tools that would be effective with Russia, if we chose to use them; but for now we have chosen not to use them. Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I have two questions for you, Mr Solana: how do you think we can further and credibly deepen military and defence cooperation if the Member States are not prepared to respect the common commitments? Conferences are welcome, but what counts are the results. I also wonder what you have in mind to convince the Member States to make this force of sixty thousand men a reality, and not just a figure on paper. If we look around, the reality we see is that of a CFSP that risks remaining just talk. Consider, for example, the defense cuts made in Germany, which are of concern not only to Defense Minister Scharping, but to the whole of Europe. In my country, Sweden, the objective to be achieved in compliance with solidarity commitments is 2,500 men to be allocated to Union interventions. But our defense is currently only able to make 1,500 men available, precisely because of budget cuts. Making a calculation for the entire Union, a true calculation if there are no changes, in 2003 we will not have 60,000 men, but 35-40,000 in the best of cases. My second question concerns the following. A few weeks ago, you were quoted in a clearly distorted way by a German-language media outlet. I would like to know the background to this, and in particular whether you, as High Representative, have really considered the possibility of treating Austria differently from other countries in your office; if so, I would also like to know who would have given you this mandate and what room for manoeuvre you would have.	it
As you know, these goals aim to halve poverty by 2015, either by raising the age of compulsory schooling, by significantly reducing infant mortality, or by a range of welfare interventions that effectively achieve this goal. This would mean reducing the extreme poverty in which a third of the world's population lives, reducing the extreme poverty in the living conditions of about a billion people, which is extraordinary but certainly requires strong participation and strong action from the entire international community. This is the fourth aspect of the new development paradigm that I would like to emphasize: development policies are seen today, particularly in recent years, as an increasingly global issue that suffers from a lack of strong international leadership. The concerted actions of the institutions of the United Nations system have contributed significantly to this, as has the Bretton Woods system. It is particularly worth noting the strong impetus given to this debate by the World Bank, notably through its Comprehensive Framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund. For the first time, an institution of this nature is placing the problem of poverty reduction at the heart of its policies and establishing a connection, hitherto unimaginable for such an institution, between debt relief and poverty. It is also in the light of this new role that international organizations are playing in relation to development problems that we must reflect on the role of the European Union in this context. The Portuguese Presidency insists on the need for the European Union to make its important role at the international level, as the main donor, more compatible with a leading and more active role in this movement to renew development policies, at the international level, by increasing its capacity for articulation and coordination, particularly with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system. In order to strengthen the role of the European Union in the context of international development policies, we believe that three fundamental types of action must be developed. First, to improve the effectiveness of development policy. As everyone knows, a comprehensive evaluation of development policies took place in 1995. It was possible to present the conclusions under the German Presidency. The main conclusions emphasize the need for a more coherent European Union policy and a general strategic vision of the European Union with regard to development problems. They emphasize the aspects relating to the need for greater coordination and complementarity between organizational harmonization and simplification policies, the framework within which the Union's cooperation policy is implemented, and the need to make aid management more effective, in particular by reviewing its intervention mechanisms, as well as the need to strengthen the evaluation system and ensure greater transparency in the way this aid is applied. The second aspect that needs to be highlighted concerns the need for greater complementarity between the Union and the policies of the Member States.	fr
"The reason she cannot do so, as some Members have pointed out, is that she has been to Hungary and Romania to see for herself the scale of the disaster and to determine how best to help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities deal with this crisis. We are prepared to do so. Earlier this month, we contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River to urgently obtain more information about the accident. The Romanians have contacted the UNEF and OCHA in Geneva, requesting that an international team of independent experts assess the damage in the Danube basin. We are prepared to cooperate in this assessment if Hungary and Romania request it and if access to the sites for the nationals of both countries is guaranteed, which is obviously crucial. It is clearly essential to establish an accurate picture of the scale of the damage as quickly as possible so that we can decide exactly how best to respond. Our efforts today pursue this objective. It is also necessary to shed light on the legal responsibilities of the mining company and the Romanian authorities. This point is important, as some speakers have pointed out. The polluter pays principle is a cornerstone of the European Union's environmental policy. The International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River reflects this, and it should be applied in this specific case. The European Union should not bear the cost of compensation owed in place of the mining company. The Union has mobilized some €20 million over the past seven years to support the protection of the Danube basin. As part of pre-accession assistance for the region, it might be possible to redirect some of the aid we provide through ISPA and the PHARE programme to address the most harmful consequences of this accident, as long as the polluter pays principle is fully respected. In the longer term, we will have to see what lessons can be learned from this disaster and how to prevent such catastrophes in the first place. This incident strengthens the case for strengthening European civil protection, as President Prodi said recently in a speech and as one or two Members have made clear today. But for the time being, the priority is to tackle the crisis. As I said, my colleague, Mrs Wallström, is here today. She will have to keep Parliament fully informed of the actions she will propose following this visit. This is a real catastrophe for Europe, and Europe must respond to it and do everything in its power to prevent such appalling accidents as this one from continuing to blight its future. The debate is closed. We now move on to the vote. VOTES. The only reason we voted for the PSE-Greens/EFA-UEG/NGL compromise resolution is that only this resolution allowed us to ""condemn the decision of the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its Italian factory."""	fr
Over the past few years, the Community has spent around €200 million on mine clearance, victim assistance and related activities. Member States have spent similar amounts. However, there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to resolve the landmine problem within a limited timeframe. Commissioner Nielson has highlighted the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States. These are problems that have been discussed for years. The Commission needs to change its internal organisation, strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its interventions, if possible by establishing a central mine action policy cell with adequate resources. It would also need faster contracting and implementation procedures, a strengthened multiannual budget line and a marked improvement in programme management. There is a need for a thorough evaluation of the effectiveness of demining programmes in each of the countries seriously affected by the landmine problem. In my view, the issue of anti-personnel mines presents many of the same organisational, procedural, operational and financial management difficulties that have long plagued the Commission and the Union as a whole. Are these evils of the past or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still incapable of realising its aspirations? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new agreement between the ACP countries and the European Union represents an important step towards greater coherence. And it is good that criteria such as human rights, democracy, the rule of law and good governance are reaffirmed in this agreement more forcefully than has been the case up to now and that most of our relations are no longer based on the old colonial model, but that these political criteria have taken on greater weight. This is in fact the condition for any development. Without compliance with these criteria, development has no chance of success. This, Mr Modrow, also applies to Cuba. I am pleased that Cuba is moving closer to this process. However, some changes are still needed in that country. We are all familiar with the Amnesty International reports. You may have a different opinion to that of the majority in Parliament on one of the last bastions of communism and may not agree with the principle of good governance, but it is an important criterion for the European Union. I would like to address a second issue. We are discussing coherence here. Many colleagues have given examples that show the lack of coherence in different policies. However, in my view, development policy as such also needs more coherence. It is not a sign of coherence that coordination between Member States continues to fail, that sometimes contradictory projects are implemented in developing countries by the European Union and the Member States. It is also not consistent with taxpayers to have a development policy included in the Union budget, while the European Development Fund remains outside it.	it
I will conclude, Mr President, by stating that progress is undoubtedly difficult, fragile, uncertain and requires us to closely monitor the various stages, punctuated by rigorous and meticulous monitoring operations. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I rise to express the enthusiasm and hope with which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the opening of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I sincerely hope that this agreement, as the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, envisages, will serve as an example to be extended as quickly as possible to other countries in the region, especially Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Kosovo and, perhaps one day, Serbia. We are convinced that the rapid opening of these negotiations and their speedy conclusion offer the only possibility of restoring peace to the region, a peace that did not automatically follow the end of the war in Kosovo. We will thus avoid the recurrence of conditions conducive to further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence, with all the risks that this entails for the stability of the continent, and indeed of the planet. While it is true that the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to include the countries of Eastern Europe is fundamentally motivated by the maintenance of peace and security, such a motivation must be even more present in our relations with Albania and the countries of the former Yugoslav republic and, logically, it requires us to commit ourselves resolutely to the path of this parallel enlargement to the countries of South-Eastern Europe, represented by the agreements under consideration. It is in this spirit, bordering on provocation, that we have tabled an amendment aimed at transferring competences concerning South-Eastern Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement. The idea of a more rapid and direct participation of South-Eastern Europe in the life of the European institutions has also led us to propose welcoming to the European Parliament a limited number of observers sent by the national parliaments, who would also second members of their staff to work for the Court of Justice and the Commission. In any case, we are convinced that, in order to promote the evolution of the region towards a more democratic society, essentially based on the market economy, we must immediately take concrete initiatives to intensify the fight against corruption and improve the effectiveness of international aid for reconstruction and development. It is with this aim in mind that we have tabled several amendments in the hope that Parliament will accept them. The aim is, first, to eliminate customs duties on exports from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the European Union and to compensate for the gradual reduction of customs duties levied by Macedonia on European products, provided that the principle of common customs control at Macedonia's borders is accepted. Second, to induce the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, through adequate financial support, to gradually peg its currency to the euro, as a first step towards the Europeanization of the Macedonian economy as a whole and with the subsequent objective of eliminating any perversion of the banking system. Third, to give global aid and assistance to the region a certain multilateral character, without imposing on the recipient country direct obligations towards the donor country.	fr
"The aforementioned positions reinforce the question I address to Mr. Solana. Poland only needs five words to be fulfilled: nothing without us, above us! What do the current EU Member States do in response to this reasonable request from a state aspiring to membership? Mr. President, I would also like to welcome the presence of the High Representative and his willingness to answer the Members' questions at this second appearance. This was not possible during his appearance in November—certainly not through any fault of Mr. Solana's—although it is only fair to acknowledge that he took note and undertook to respond to the questions posed by Members as soon as possible. I believe it is also fair to recognize the efforts Mr. Solana is making to achieve a more effective, more visible, and more coherent common foreign and security policy for the European Union. And in this regard, I agree with the interventions made by some colleagues who spoke before me on the need to have a comprehensive policy that combines not only military elements, but also civilian, diplomatic, humanitarian, and police elements, to which Mr. Solana referred. The Portuguese Presidency has indeed made great progress, establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies. In record time, it organized this informal Council of Defense Ministers and outlined a series of milestones in the long march toward this common foreign and security policy. One of them was this Sintra Council, about which I would like to ask Mr. Solana a few questions. This Council was based on two documents: a British document on the headline goals, on priority objectives, and another document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union. Mr. Solana, I would like to ask you if, at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy, you would be willing to explain at length to the members of this committee—together with Mr. Patten, to whom I am putting the same question, and with the President-in-Office of the Council, to whom I would also ask, Mr. Solana, to forward this request—the content of these documents discussed at the summit. A second question, Mr. High Representative, would be to know to what extent you support the observations and statements made by the French Minister of Defense, to the effect that Member States should allocate 0.7% of gross domestic product to defense spending. I would like to know your opinion, whether you share that point of view, whether you truly consider a more decisive contribution from Member States in this area necessary. Thirdly, what is your assessment of the recently concluded ""Crisex 2000"" exercises, in which the European Union, for the first time, shared a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization? And fourthly, Mr. Solana, I would like to know whether, should the Member States request it, you would be willing to chair the Political and Defense Committee, and thus add to the entire experience you currently have as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, as Secretary-General of the Western European Union, and as former Secretary-General of NATO. Mr. High Representative, as rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs on security and defense issues, I will limit my remarks to these matters."	es
This means that the proposal before us is not primarily concerned with solving the problem of the movement of these workers, but is only aimed at creating better conditions for service providers. Furthermore, in the name of simplifying procedures, the Berger report introduces highly questionable changes, such as the establishment of a common information system allowing access to documents issued by the authorities of any Member State. Berger reports (A5-0007/2000) and Berger (A5-0012/2000) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives which aim to facilitate the free movement of workers who are nationals of third countries and, at the same time, the free movement of services. Essentially, these proposals introduce the EC service provision card which, in future, will enable approximately five million nationals of third countries, legally resident in a Member State of the European Union, to provide services in other Member States. This possibility is currently hampered by problems such as obtaining visas and work permits. The first proposal for a directive authorises companies established in a Member State which employ third-country nationals to temporarily post them to another Member State to provide services. Under the terms of the provisions envisaged, the employer would only be required to apply for a service provision card for each worker concerned. Of course, in order to obtain such a card, the worker would have to reside legally in a Member State and be insured by a social security system. The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed third-country nationals. While I agree in essence with the European Commission's proposals, it is also true that some of the provisions could appear ambiguous. This is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur. This will make the provisions clearer and prevent any possible abuse. Other amendments aim to simplify administrative procedures, for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing the cards. Such an amendment seemed to me to be essential in order to avoid the administrative delays which all too often hinder the correct application of the new provisions. I can only welcome the adoption of these directives in their amended version. In fact, it would no longer be possible to tolerate people legally resident in the European Union encountering so many difficulties. This conflicts with the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the Treaties establishing our Union. Marinho report (A5-0003/2000). We have serious reservations about the Council's proposed amendments. How can we explain that, just when it is asking for an increase in the number of judges of the Court of First Instance (which, as we know, is overworked), it is at the same time proposing to extend its powers? The effects of the first measure would, in fact, be cancelled out by the second. Some argue that perfection is not of this world, but a brief historical excursus should enable them to better understand our reservations.	it
"Social security and social protection represent one of the greatest achievements of workers in Europe, achieved through years of struggle against the aspirations of big business and thanks to the constant solidarity that is characteristic of workers. In today's Europe of unemployment and underemployment, there is an urgent need to ensure more extensive social protection and the expansion of workers' rights. This, however, requires a different system of economic and social development than the one the EU, by its very nature and essence, is capable of producing. In summary, we strongly oppose the ""modernization"" of the social protection system sought by the Commission in its communication and point out that we will not support the report under discussion by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. This concludes the explanations of vote. (The sitting adjourned at 1:55 p.m. and resumed at 3:00 p.m.) Next meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights (continuation) The next item on the agenda is the debate on the Council statement on the Union's priorities for the next meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights (20 March 2000), including the situation in China. Mr President, I regret the absence of the President-in-Office of the Council; this is a statement by the Council, and I think that his participation in the continuation of the debate might have been useful. It does not seem superfluous to me to recall that the inclusion of this item on the agenda is clearly due to the need, expressed by all the political groups, for Parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, in order to make its voice heard on an issue so sensitive and popular with this Parliament. I believe that, following the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, we can all agree that the current situation in the field of human rights is far from what would be desirable. At Union level, we cannot fail to note that the situation is not entirely satisfactory. For example, although the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is an element common to all Member States, not all its subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all States. A clear disadvantage in this area is also the fact that the European Union as such is not a signatory to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with all the additional difficulties that this situation entails. I hope that all these problems can be raised and dealt with in the context of the current debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In terms of foreign policy, I believe that most of the points included in our resolution present a fairly realistic view and do not exactly give cause for optimism, since issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, the torture still practiced in many supposedly democratic countries, and the situation of minorities in many parts of the world require a clear, visible, and effective response from the European Union. I believe the resolution contains a number of essential points, but I would like to focus on one in particular: the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations."	de
"When we hold intergovernmental conferences and reconsider amending the Treaty, we must bear in mind that the EU is expanding every day, even contrary to the Treaty, as we have just seen. I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon. The Intergovernmental Conference will open on 14 February, and it must be completed before the end of 2000. It is a huge undertaking, but it can be done. I believe there is general agreement here this afternoon among all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to undertake the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement. In other words, we must go beyond what have been called the important ""Amsterdam loose ends."" These loose ends include the extension of qualified majority voting—in my country we approved of it, but not in the area of taxation—a new weighting of votes in the Council to favor the largest states, and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe. Regarding the last point, Ireland wants to retain its right to appoint a full and equal member of the Commission regardless of the number of Member States that join. We are willing to consider the new weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States agree to each Member State having a full and equal member of the Commission. I think I speak for many smaller countries in making this particular point. The IGC should also discuss the possible division of the Treaties in two—into a political area and an area relating to the Constitution. We would accept the division of the Treaties provided that it does not limit the control that smaller Member States have in the rededication of the entire political area of the Treaty. In other words, if we are not fully represented in the Commission, we will have no influence on the political debates. We are therefore closely monitoring the development of this whole point. We look forward to the presentation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to learning about its content. The Treaty of Amsterdam, Mr. President, set the number of Members of the European Parliament at 700, and it will be necessary to debate in this Parliament how that number will be distributed throughout an enlarged Europe. Mr. President, the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference must be expanded. The most important issue that must be included on the agenda is the internal differentiation of the Union. It is regrettable that here in Parliament, almost no attention has yet been paid to the internal disintegration of the Union, which, however, is essential for the enlargement of the Union to be carried out as agreed. The former President of the Commission, Mr. Jacques Delors, has once again raised the idea of a European Confederation in the media. He also said that the countries at the forefront of integration, the avant-garde countries, should be able to advance at a faster pace than the others and, for the sake of clarity, should have their own institutions. The current President of the Commission, Mr. Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr. Solana, have put forward ideas that point in the same direction."	es
The Commission, for its part, is prepared to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot renounce - indeed, you would perhaps be among the first to criticize us for doing so - checking the relevance and quality of the programs proposed to us. Second observation, the deadlines for submitting programs and the possibility of presenting a programming supplement together with the programs. I have no objections to this idea of submitting a programming supplement together with the main program. However, this cannot mean an extension of the main deadline. I would point out that it is six months for this program. This deadline, which is also identical to the one we granted for Interreg and for the Objective 2 SPDs, should generally be sufficient, it seems to me, to establish a program, which does not prevent the projects from being defined later. Regarding URBAN, I would like to conclude with a final thought. One of you expressed the hope that this urban dimension would not be limited to URBAN. I fully agree. I myself said at the meeting of the Ministers for Planning, Territorial Development and Urban Affairs that I was concerned - and I am working on this - that in the SPDs, in the CCAs, in the programmes for which we are beginning negotiations, that the urban dimension is found outside of URBAN, in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programmes, and I believe I can say both our vigilance but also the translation of this urban dimension outside of URBAN into all the Structural Fund programmes. But for the future, since we must look ahead, I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN will be implemented in practice, and also to see the experiences or lessons that we can learn, because clearly this urban dimension will be at the heart of what could be, for the next financial perspectives, a new European territorial planning policy. I have not forgotten, we cannot forget, that 80% of European citizens now live in cities and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important. I say it again and again, we will be attentive to the presence of the urban dimension in all structural fund programming. I would now like, Mr President, to mention Interreg and thank, as I did for Mrs Arlene McCarthy, your rapporteur, Mr Francis Decourrière, for the quality and relevance of his work. He insisted on several points, on which we agree and many of you do too: the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands: cross-border, transnational, interregional; the Community added value of Interreg, its readability in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border, transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures - what I called, in connection with another debate that begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, the common spirit of Europeans that we must strengthen, this is, with Interreg and thanks to Interreg, how to strengthen the common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programs with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership to guarantee the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and socio-economic partners.	fr
"Finally, with regard to major energy networks, the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds in the development of energy transmission networks when this helps to reduce dependence on an external supplier or combat the effects of isolation. This applies, in particular, to the region I mentioned in the Azores, but also to all the outermost regions and, I would add, to certain regions handicapped by isolation due to mountainous conditions, for example. Commissioner, I understand your answer, but on the other hand, the reason I asked this question is precisely because we are concerned, given that the report on the third framework programme for research includes a project called the ""International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor"". It is worth several billion ECU, obviously, and areas eligible for structural funds, such as those classified under Objective 1, would be suitable for this type of installation. What we would like to know is whether, in fact, within the framework of the installation of this research site, and not perhaps directly within the specific framework of ""nuclear research,"" the Commission would be able to finance this type of project. Mr. Barnier, excuse me, but you haven't quite answered the last part of my question about major energy transmission networks. Could you provide an answer on this subject? Are you worried about whether, with the structural funds, we will finance the installation of nuclear power plants somewhere? I am simplifying. We could say that this is not the case. I told you, Madam Deputy, that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States, in accordance with the Structural Funds regulations. Consequently, the Commission services are not systematically informed of all the projects selected. However, you are right to ask me; it is your job, and mine to answer you. As has already happened in the past, Member States are required to respond, to the extent that the Commission questions them or requests clarification. So, I will go a little further than the trust usually shared between Member States and the Commission, and on the specific point you raise, I will see exactly what it is. The Member State, or Member States concerned, will then be required to respond to me, and I will forward this response to you immediately. I thought I had responded to the issue of large networks. The energy situation varies enormously across the regions of the European Union, and assistance from the Funds, in certain cases and for certain regions, could be justified, particularly in cases where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped. That is the response I can give on this link between large energy transmission networks and the structural funds. I call Question No 46 of (H-0052/00): Subject: Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission's recent helpful reply to my priority written question on the Structural Funds and additionality, I would like to know whether the Commission is considering amending the rules on additionality. In particular, would the Commission be in favour of amending those rules to apply additionality not only at Member State level but also within Member States, in relation to budgetary provisions applicable between national authorities and regions or countries with internal autonomy?"	fr
The identification of genetically modified additives plays a particularly important role here. On the one hand, it allows farmers to make a conscious decision about whether or not they want to use such animal feed, and on the other, it allows consumers to refuse feed that has been produced from GMOs. Finally, our group would like to extend its sincere thanks to the rapporteur, who has gone to great lengths. I think we can look forward to Mr Byrne's response. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is more concerned with formal issues, namely how additives should be approved, and to a lesser extent, which additives they are and how they work. I must take this opportunity to stress how important it is that all directives of this kind are dealt with in future using the Article 152 procedure, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive perspective. We cannot continue, as we have done so far, to deal with every detail piecemeal, often when harmful consequences have already occurred. The rapporteur has focused on the testing and labelling that must be carried out on GMOs contained in additives used in animal feed. I would like to raise the issue of antibiotics once again. Although five of the nine types of antibiotics that were originally permitted for addition to animal feed are now banned, it is extremely important that the remaining four types be banned. Not only for the sake of public health, but also for the sake of the animals concerned. We are now at the stage where we know the formidable threat that antibiotic resistance poses to human health, particularly for young children. Many Member States are already able to demonstrate the extent to which the excessive use of antibiotics in animal farming is unnecessary. Several countries have long since abolished this practice, and a number of other countries are in the process of doing so, with positive results. When it comes to antibiotics, the famous precautionary principle was long ago ignored. However, when it comes to the environment, there is another important principle, namely the principle of exchange. I would like to briefly mention the issue of coccidiostats. This is a technical antibiotic, which is not absolutely necessary. There are alternative methods. It is possible to vaccinate chickens. This is admittedly a little more expensive, but has no environmental consequences. Today, slurry containing coccidiostats is spread on fields, which then passes into the water, i.e., into the most important component of our food. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on additives in animal feed addresses a technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in animal feed and between the producers of these additives. But today, after the serious dioxin crisis that hit Belgium and other European countries last summer, we cannot simply reflect on a simple question of competition. Indeed, at the time, even if it went less well known to the general public, the Commission's scientific experts discovered industrial lime residues laden with dioxin in citrus pulp imported from Brazil.	fr
Inaugurating an unfinished building in the middle of an election campaign, which could not be occupied eight months after its inauguration, has made the Spanish government look very ridiculous. The fact that the Spanish government has made a fool of itself does not worry me because, ultimately, it is responsible for it, but the fact that the Commission has made a fool of itself by endorsing, through its presence, this inappropriate conduct does worry me. That is why I ask you, Commissioner: does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should have been inaugurated in the middle of an election campaign? Does it seem normal to you that the Commission should have endorsed, through its presence, this inappropriate conduct by the Spanish government? It is not for me to comment on the internal political situation of any Member State. I would therefore like to refrain from any comment on the situation just mentioned by Mr Berenguer. I must admit that the reason why an inauguration ceremony is being organized in Spain escapes me. I can tell you that I hope that this building will now be operational as quickly as possible. Let me add that I myself hope to be in Alicante at the end of May to speak at a conference. I hope that this building will have been operational by then. I would like to say to the Commissioner that this is not an electoral issue. As members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we have been following the creation of this institution and, of course, it is clear that this building was inaugurated for electoral reasons. Today – a year later – it is still unoccupied, which means that the Commission is spending money on a fake inauguration. One should ask to what extent this expenditure of funds on a fake inauguration was justified. Once again, the Commission does not deal with the considerations underlying the actions of the Member States. The Commission deals with what is officially declared and what is done. We do not intend to engage in what is called a trial by intention. We are therefore concerned with public and official acts and affairs and not with any underlying motives. That is why it seems difficult to satisfy Mr. Medina on this point and to answer his question. Once again, the Commission does not ask itself why something takes place more or less late, apart from the fact that the Commission attaches importance to the fact that a building such as the one planned for this Office is inaugurated and used as quickly as possible. Furthermore, the Commission is also not concerned with whether specific expenditures are real or virtual. As far as they are concerned, all expenditures are real. As for the rest, the future will tell. Question No 54 of (H-0117/00): Subject: Alcohol monopoly and the internal market What measures does the Commission intend to take to prevent Sweden from maintaining, as it clearly intends to do, its state monopoly on alcohol and therefore the corresponding import restrictions, thereby giving precedence to the rules of the internal market?	fr
"Europe's fishing sectors are facing serious problems, and I have a genuine concern for the industry's well-being. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to gather the necessary information and muster the political will to pursue truly long-term solutions for communities dependent on fishing, rather than myopically pursuing short-term fixes. I commend the report to the House. The Committee on the Environment is generally satisfied with the Commission's communication, and we are pleased that the Committee on Fisheries has adopted our amendments. It is now widely recognized that fishing has an impact on the marine environment that goes far beyond simply catching the target species plus a small amount of bycatch and is felt everywhere. We welcome the Commission's intention to integrate environmental protection into other EU policies—including the Common Fisheries Policy. After all, the Treaties have stated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies. However, as has already been stated, the adoption of a strict definition of the precautionary principle is crucial, because it is all too easy to pay mere lip service and then continue with ""business as usual."" A good example in this context would be the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement. However, one aspect is missing from the communication: monitoring and control. All sensible measures and regulations will not lead to stock conservation without an effective system to ensure compliance with the rules. Control is the responsibility of the Member States. The Council recently adopted a list of serious infringements, which attempts to coordinate, to a certain extent, the punishment of similar offenses in different countries. This is an important step forward, but the Commission and the Committee on Fisheries continually point out that much still needs to be improved in the control programs of all Member States. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report. Mr. President, Fishing is a major economic activity, behind which very large investments are made and which provides basic employment for entire regions of the Community under truly harsh conditions. However, the idea that some people have of fishing is usually extremely simplistic and can range from pure folklore to the insult of viewing fishermen as callous pirates and plunderers. I regret to say that, because of its connection with the environment, this report seems to have provided an opportunity for people with such ideas to spout their own particular nonsense. If Mr. Katiforis's report had been adopted in its original form, no member of the Committee on Fisheries would ever again have been able to set foot in a fishing region without exposing themselves to some risk of being lynched. The relationship between fishing and marine ecosystems is obvious. But this relationship is much broader and involves many factors, such as pollution and maritime traffic. To blame fishermen alone for environmental destruction is as unfair as it is wrong. Our committee avoided its own humiliation by a series of amendments, 14 of which I myself tabled, most of which were accepted by the rapporteur, for which I sincerely thank him."	de
However, if some of the amendments were to be approved, particularly those tabled by the PPE Group, we believe that the report would be distorted and transformed into a contradictory document lacking in rigour; in that case, therefore, we will have to reconsider our support. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, among the various issues on the agenda of this joint debate, I would like to include a reflection on the issue raised by our colleague Berenguer, namely the modernisation of competition policy to which the Commission's White Paper refers. I frankly believe that this modernisation process has been satisfactory. Commissioner Monti is achieving good results in his policy, like his predecessor, with the clear merit of having been able to guarantee, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, the necessary corrections for the regular functioning of the market economy in the Union without those side effects which, as we economists know well, risk being produced when a market expands, as has happened in the European Union since 1993. But if everything works, if we are satisfied, if the Commission's line has been substantially correct, then why a change? Various reasons have been put forward in support of this. Mr Berenguer has drawn up a very careful analysis, justifying the need for the change and the related reforms with the need to improve the functioning of competition; however, what is closest to my heart is ensuring that the standards and criteria applicable by the various competent authorities in the Member States are effectively identical everywhere. Otherwise, we would find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: it would in fact be the Commission that introduces elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market. In that case, instead of progress, we would have seen a regression in the application of competition policy within the Union. Mr President, I would first like to express my gratitude to the Commission for the improvement that the 28th Commission report on competition policy in the Union has made compared with previous editions. I would also like to highlight the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, who has been able to analyse in concise terms a text as vast and dense as this one. And I fully support him when he says that regions - such as the Basque Country, which I represent here - need to be given room for action by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity. However, I cannot forget the criticisms formulated on several occasions by both Member States and market operators who, faced with the broad margin of manoeuvre and discretion recognised to the Commission in relation to the assessment of each individual case, complain about the existence of legal uncertainty, in the absence of clear rules of the game that allow interested parties to foresee the position of the authorities and, therefore, to act accordingly when submitting their respective applications for obtaining subsidies to support economic activities and employment, in mergers between companies, etc. The only guarantee has so far been represented by the attempt to seek a position favourable to authorisation already in advance, by submitting individual applications which in any case are not processed in less than six to eight months, an excessively long period which is added to the obstacles that already weigh on activities generating wealth and employment.	it
We tend to believe that this economic growth in the Union has a solid foundation, now and for the coming years, and that we must not lose sight of the fact that we are in an open, global and highly competitive economy. If we want to match the leadership of the United States, or even take over, we must avoid the interventionism initially proposed by Mr. Katiforis, and avoid any excessive intervention by public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures. Furthermore, the Member States refused to allocate more resources during the discussions on Agenda 2000, so that at the level of the European Union, we will have few means at our disposal in the coming years. On the other hand, we insist on the need to continue to deepen the construction of the European internal market, which still has serious shortcomings. In certain sectors, such as air transport, energy or telecommunications, the costs borne by our companies are still very high if we compare unit costs with those of the United States or other countries that are equally competitive at international level. The report contains information stating that the bureaucratic cost of setting up a new business is 500 euros in the United States, while it is on average 1,600 euros in the European Union. There is therefore still excessive bureaucracy and disproportionate intervention. We believe that it is by respecting the austerity agreements established with the programs that follow the Stability Pact and by deepening the creation of a market with fewer obstacles at all levels that we will achieve the levels of competitiveness necessary for the European Union. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the passion that my predecessors recognized in Mr Katiforis had, to my ears, had no other objective than to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of tens of millions of unemployed, excluded and precarious people in our European Union. This is the objective to which he called on the European Parliament: to give hope to the people of Europe. There is economic recovery, certainly, but it is only marginally reducing unemployment in Europe. The votes of the EPP-ED and the Liberals have very significantly diminished, even reversed, the meaning of its message. This is why we did not vote for the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we will not vote for it in its current form. What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report? Firstly, the affirmation that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, respectful in particular of the European Union's commitments at the Kyoto and Buenos Aires conferences. There are enormous tasks to be accomplished to meet our commitments by the fateful year of 2008 when we will have to return to greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels. Enormous work needs to be done in the areas of transport, energy saving, and even replacing travel with Internet communications.	fr
