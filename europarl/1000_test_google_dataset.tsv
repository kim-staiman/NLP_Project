In some Member States, it is not simply a question of informing an opinion which is not as well informed as it could be.This is certainly important but it is also a question of fighting against disinformation propagated by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organizations that exist.The commission must be very vigorous in the responses it will advance to certain comments which will reach it within the framework of this campaign.Mr. Corbett, thank you for your appreciation.I gladly accept your invitation and, if I understood correctly, you want that, when I come to the Yorkshire, I not only mention the reform of the European institutions, but also the structural funds.I will therefore come to do this double task.I forgot, moreover, to say the concern I have to go, and I have already done it, before the national parliaments, not only by meeting their representatives here, but by going to see them on the spot.Ten days ago, I was in Westminster.You see, Mr. Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties.I'm going to Bundestag next week in Berlin.I went to the French Senate.So, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will directly see the national parliaments.It is not a question, with regard to dialogue with citizens, of making propaganda or marketing, not even communication.I would like this dialogue to be really a dialogue, and that after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of the institutional reform, those who are here in the gallery can intervene and respond to open micro.We will, I repeat, conduct this initiative for dialogue in punctual or structured cooperation with the Member States, and I wish, with your support, that the governments of the fifteen can be associated, according to the methods that they will judge the most timely and the most adequate, with this initiative of dialogue.Mr. President, I would like to join the Circle of Studies created by Mr. Barnier and comprising 700 trainees so that he has people with whom to discuss.It is hardly pleasant to have to discuss transparency or problems relating to the intergovernmental conference.With regard to the intergovernmental conference, Mr. Barnier declared, during his presentation before the Assembly, that social policy would not be the subject of decisions taken by majority, but I note, when reading page 63, that the fight against discrimination, that freedom of movement and that the right of stay - that is to say the directives on the right of stay - that the whole social security,social policy will be the subject of a vote - with a few exceptions - a qualified majority.Does Mr. Barnier cares that he is attacking the very nerve of the legislative process of the Member States?It is to defend these questions that people go to the polls to determine a new majority in the Danish Parliament or to any other parliament.Can these questions be managed by Brussels?Are we here in the decentralization process that Mr. Prodi told us about this morning?	fr
Here are two simple examples of the real problems behind the delays of the European Justice System;In this field, delays can cause serious personal difficulties and sometimes even tragedies.I don't want to say that our national legal systems are not perfect, but too often it happens that they must wait for a preliminary sentence of the European Court.The statistics show a worrying tendency towards an extension of the times required for preliminary acts: I do not intend to reproach anything to the Court or to its staff, but rather to criticize the structure of the Court itself and the lack of resources at its disposal in a rapidly expanding European Union.The proposals contained in this report are certainly acceptable as a temporary palliative, but Europe is a legal construction, for the correct functioning of which the courts constitute an essential element.In view of the imminent expansion, the CIG must implement a radical reform and renovation of the judicial system;Otherwise we, elected representatives, will have to face the growing dissatisfaction of our citizens who cannot get justice quickly and effectively.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, I also want to thank the speaker for this excellent relationship.I am also totally in agreement with his conclusions, especially where he proposes to increase the number of référendaire of the judges at the first instance court and to give the same an proper translation service.I believe that this is actually necessary because we have heard - while we were visiting the legal commission in Luxembourg - which, of course and by virtue of decisions, made for so to speak from the high, when it comes to using a common translation service, the Court of Justice enjoys a certain priority compared to the first instance court which consequently cannot often deal with important issues.However, I am also of the opinion that the reforms must proceed beyond what we are about to decide here at this moment.By way of example, it is better to start a reflection on those sectors in which there are already judging bodies that operate in a similar way to the courts and as a preliminary: just remember Alicante, or what is provided for in the field of law of the European public function.The first instance court, upon assignment of the necessary competences, could therefore become the last application.In my opinion, it will also be necessary to intervene regarding the attitude of the commission that tends to renationalize, that is, to report at national level, the decisions regarding competition.It seems to me to reflect in this regard, since these cases will no longer arrive at the first instance court but must be examined, in the production of documents, directly by the Court of Justice.We must reflect on how to resolve this situation.Eventually it should be foreseen that it is the competent section of the first instance court that examines the production of documents regarding competition.Furthermore, it should be reflected whether it is right or not - we have also had cases of deputies or parliamentary groups that have presented appeals against the European Parliament - that for these issues the first instance court is competent, although in truth it is constitutional requests which, rigorously logic, should compete with the Court of Justice rather than the Court of First Grade.	it
"If this is the role that the Commission intends to play for the next five years, we, federalists convinced, we are sure that this is not the right way and in relation to this we will ask for explanations and judge what the commission intends to do.The reform is important, but if it leads to a impairment, a reduction and a decrease in the supranational powers of the commission, the consolidation of European integration is at stake, what the founding parents had thought for the European Commission.Mr. President, as for the other points, for example, that of economic and social policy: it is true that the European social model is going through a deep crisis, it is true that the problem of unemployment is no accident that it is the problem number one that none of our policies has managed to solve, but it is not true that it can be resolved by formulating a list of the problems we address in the past, without having a clear vision, a proposal, a proposal, a proposal, a proposal, a proposal in which a proposal in our Europethat they advance at a pace that is one of the most sustained and it is no accident that they are the economies that have managed to convert the flexibility of the labor market and the company into its number one objective.If we continue to get stuck in the proposals that to date have given bad results, I do not know how we will and what the commission can do.The same applies to the extension by itself, without linked to a much more effective reform of the European Union and its structures, as well as proposals that the Commission could have even been formulated within the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference.Mr. President, I want to tell him something positive, perhaps against the opinion of some deputies, about the telegram he has sent to the Austrian government.His position has convinced us: he has done well in not even more isolating that country.Even so, we will see what the specific gestures will be in practice.I repeat, Mr. President, in our opinion, it is a somewhat myopic vision.Above all, an impulse in the fields that I have cited, for example, in relation to the Balkans.Is it possible to continue leaving Balkans out of the extension, without thinking that Croatia, Macedonia and other countries also have the right to be in this common house?Mrs. President, Mr. Prodi, I would like to praise her proposal of a radical decentralization of the activities of the Union and ask him why he then presents a legislative catalog that centralizes.I remember the speech of his predecessor five years ago.He promised as you ""less and more"" and Mr. Santer ended up having given ""much more and much worse"" and I think you can't give what promises.Speaks of decentralization and centralization.The legislative catalog is a long enumeration of matters where citizens lose influence and where you, Mr. Prodi, remove it to citizens, even in social matters."	es
Fourth point on which Ms. Hedkvist Petersen insisted at the moment, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and for young people.Fifth point, the importance and role of small and medium -sized enterprises, Mr. Vatanen said it with great vehemence earlier.Finally, the positive effects on the national administrations of the structural fund management system, the motivation of civil servants when they manage these funds, even if it is sometimes complicated, and the importance of making improvements to the procedures for assessment, monitoring and control of the committee again.I inform the European Parliament on this subject of my intention to organize in the middle of the year 2000 a seminar with the national and regional authorities on this question of evaluating procedures for exchanging good practices in the management of structural funds.I would like to mention some specific points.Mr. Berend, you wanted the zoning to be quickly implemented.We finish with the zoning.Tomorrow, four new countries will be the subject of a decision by the Commission and very soon, I hope, it will be the turn of Italy.So, you will be satisfied on this point, since all the countries concerned by objective 2 will be zoned.Regarding the underground economy that you evoke in your report, I know that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are based on the reliability of the data and as Mr. Cocilovo has mentioned, there is a problem of reliability of this data.To a certain extent, they are included in account in GDP statistics, surveys on labor forces, and in any event, I would like to underline the efforts that Eurostat makes and will continue to improve the quality of statistics.You have also mentioned, Mr. Berend, such as Mr. Aparicio Sánchez, the absence of reform of the fishing sector.On this point which interests me personally, I will recall that the small size of this sector - which does not mean that it is negligible - and its concentration in a very low number of regions do not facilitate its analysis in a regional framework.This type of sectoral analysis is more of the practice and competence of the Directorate General of Fisheries, under the authority of my colleague Fischler.However, I would like to assure you that the Commission will endeavor to include such an analysis in the second report on cohesion which will undoubtedly be better for these concerns.Several of you have mentioned points that must be inserted into this second report on cohesion and your rapporteur mentioned some of these points.First of all, I want to make sure that the merger of periodic reports and the cohesion report should not lead to any loss of information or a loss of interest in the content of this report on cohesion which, for me, is an extremely important instrument, not only for us to account for what is done and that we say it transparent and rigorous, so that we are examining orAlso to create a public debate with citizens and, beyond, with the elected officials that you are, on this regional policy and on what could one day be a European regional planning policy.	fr
What criteria will the Commission be based on accepting or rejecting these programs by Member States?Which committee will check the financing of the steering group and the accompanying committee as well as the correct and proper execution of the program?Since the contribution of the European Social Fund for the period 2000-2006 amounts to EUR 2.487 billion and the Equal initiative is co-financed by the Member States, the Commission is requested for a message how high the contribution of Greece will be.The Equal initiative is not limited to certain groups of people.It aims to combat discrimination on the labor market.The initiative was decided in Berlin, and there it was also determined that in the relevant actions, professional groups of asylum seekers must also be taken into account and must be included in them.I would like to highlight this important element of the initiative.The programs of the Member States elaborated as part of the community initiative must correspond to the provisions provided for in the regulation on the social fund.The Equal initiative is therefore subject to the regulation for the social fund.It was submitted to the parliament and we expect his statement next month.I have to emphasize that equal corresponds to the national needs and planning that are defined according to the agreed European strategy.The Member States or the national governments are primarily responsible for the establishment of the common sponsors, for the submission of the proposals, for the selection of those who are supposed to implement the programs, as well as for control.The General Directorate for Employment is responsible for implementation within the European Commission, and in addition, budget control is of course exercised by the General Directorate for Financial Control, the Office for Combat and the European Court of Auditors.A last part of the request finally affected the amount of the contribution provided.Greece was granted 98 million ECU.The subsidies are 80 %, in the case of the island regions and above all the remote Greek islands, the initiative participates with up to 85 %, with the own share of 15 %.Mr President, the guidelines for the Equal Community Initiative, in particular the four actions specified in it, lead to a very complicated, bureaucratic, paradoxically, but also non -transparent structures.For example, one wonders how a development partnership should prove that it fulfills the conditions of cooperation and representativity, as required in paragraph 33 of the information on action 2.On the other hand, the commitment to transnational cooperation and the complicated requirements for the planning and implementation of development partnerships inevitably lead to major projects, since only they can meet these conditions.However, this contradicts the declared intention to focus on decentralized action plans, at the level of the local authorities and in the agar regions.At the same time, the participation of the actually disadvantaged, namely the asylum seeker, the immigrants and others, is made impossible or limited to a symbolic level.If you finally consider how small the total is - 2.8 billion euros for 15 countries and such ambitious goals - then I am afraid, we will only succeed in proving which evil is unemployment.Since we are now in the phase of elaboration by the parliament, I would like to say firstly that it would really be helpful in every respect if they submitted concrete suggestions that we can take into account.	de
I appreciate that the parliament in the sensitive and complicated question of how the fees for water supply services has been flexible.I can only support the demand for a design of the water prices that are incentives for users to use water resources in a sustainable manner.In addition, I advise that the individual economic areas should adequately participate in covering the costs of the water supply services and can thus adopt the amendments 43-46 and change application 85 in principle.In my opinion, we need legally binding regulations for the costs for water services to be covered by every economic area itself.This represents a clear economic goal in which the progress achieved can be measured.That is why I support the overarching objective of change application 105, which corresponds to the original proposal of the Commission.I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering the environmental and resource costs.We are aware that pricing for water and water services is an extremely complicated question and that not only environmental goals, but also social and economic goals have to be taken into account.However, this must not serve as an excuse for subsidizing contaminant and ineffective economic areas.A message from the Commission is planned for the next future, which deals with exactly this question.Like the parliament, I am of the opinion that the period specified in the common point of view must be significantly shortened for the implementation of the directive.The same applies to the possibility of an extension granted by another 18 years.Change application 28, in which the third extension was deleted, represents a step in the right direction and can therefore be accepted.A period of 10 years, such asOn the other hand, 24 and 26 were proposed in the change applications.In my opinion, one should consider to include an express and mandatory provision to avoid deterioration in the comprehensive definition of the design of the design.The draft must also contain stricter criteria for the extension of deadlines for significantly changed or artificial water bodies and to determine less strict environmental goals.This applies to change applications 6, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 78, 80, 102 and 104. These can essentially be assumed and are supported to achieve an overarching solution.However, the claim made in amendments 27 and 29 that the Commission must agree to any extension goes too far and cannot therefore be accepted.Another important area is the protection of the groundwater.In order to break the pollution trend at the moment, we need both a starting point and an end goal.Strictive criteria for the interpretation of surveillance results are also essential.The most important sections of the change applications 25 and 73 of the parliament can therefore be accepted in principle.However, the new definition in change application 72 is too strict and cannot be used for these purposes.I suggest involving a change application 92 in a broader solution.In amendment application 71, the seasonal differences and the annual changes in groundwater levels are not taken into account.	de
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament played a pioneering role in the affirmation of human rights within the European Union.We know that governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik, commercial, geostrategic or economic interests.We have defined conditions for states wishing to enter our union and we must also define conditions for states whose candidacy we support.Because we are one of those who believe in democracy and its values.We know that freedom of the press and public information are the lungs of democracy.The air of press freedom must blow on a democratic state.And democracy must also go hand in hand with a free and informed public opinion.And there is no free and informed public opinion without social communication without supervision, and there is no free social communication and no guardianship if journalists are prosecuted, arrested or threatened.Mr. President, in the same way that we condemned in all legitimacy the actions of the Unita, which questioned the peace process in Angola, and which we firmly invited the two parties to arrest war and make peace, we condemn the persecutions and threats today and we pray to the Angolan government to let the journalists work in complete freedom, the latter being the prerogative of a state and a democratic society.Mr. President, how long will we be able to continue cooperation with Angola?Human rights are systematically and permanently flouted there, not only by Unita but also by the government itself.The trials brought against journalists go against all legal principles.The Angolan government must immediately authorize a significant presence of the UN which can play the intermediaries and inform us about human rights.Likewise, European observers must be admitted to the hearings of the journalists' trials.Europe, for a great donor that it is, has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola.If the Angolan government continues to refuse to cooperate, we cannot do without taking action.Without national reconciliation, no reconciliation with Europe is possible.Angola will then remain, alas, a gross diamond.Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, I totally agree with the resolution which is under discussion in Parliament;I agree because the situation of repression that weighs on journalists, whether it is Angolan or foreign correspondents in Angola, is so serious and scandalous that we cannot close our eyes.But this resolution is insufficient, because in reality, it starts from the principle that Angola is a rule of law which imposes certain difficulties on journalists and represses them.But there is not the subject.Angola is not a rule of law, it is a repressive dictatorship.Angola is at war, a cruel war which continues.And we cannot accept the theory in force according to which we must crush and physically eliminate the opponent to obtain peace.Consequently, repeated calls of the Angolan church, the calls that Mandela and Mebeki made yesterday for new negotiations to be started in favor of peace must be supported by Parliament.We must therefore undertake, as has already been said by another colleague, a general debate on Angola, and not only on the situation of certain journalists victims of repression in Angola.	fr
The financial resources with which the Council has provided this culture program strongly contrast with the importance of culture and education policy and the program for the objectives pursued by the European Union.Cultural activity creates an identity.Cultural activity is the expression of individuality, it is the expression of one's personality, entails relationships and establishes communication.We want a diverse Europe.We want a fundamental Europe in the principle of diversity in the unit.We want people to understand and learn to value differences.Under this reason we have spoken in favor of the distribution of the budget and the designation of resources to the different types of measures.By virtue of this reason we have rejected the strong concentration of the media in large networks and network structures.We want to encourage small and medium units, individual activity, because we want to flourish thousands of flowers.I join the words of the previous speakers.We are facing an authentic contradiction - unanimity principle, codecision procedure and conciliation committee - if what we want is to strengthen the principles of cultural policy in favor of a European conscience instead of continuing to weaken them.Mrs. President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have been able to hear, we all have, regardless of the political group to which we belong, a common political enemy, which is the Council.The decisions of the Culture Commission will stop little less than by system to the conciliation procedure, since there is always a member state that takes culture in exchange for other interests.In other words, the principle of unanimity appears as a first -range blocking instrument.The fight for an acceptable commitment has lasted almost two years, until the European Parliament has finally been able to give green light.Not even the expiration of previous programs, Caleidoscope, Ariadna and Rafael, has been able to soften the council position.The need to create a pilot transition program was imposed.All this has once again shown the weaknesses of the activities deployed by the European Union in the field of cultural policy.The political battle for the financial endowment and the elaboration of the program is fully disproportionate compared to the funds granted.Of the 410 applications that were submitted in 1999, only 55 projects were held, for the low value of 6.07 million euros in total.In the context of this program, the Council was not willing to give up a single euro to Parliament!The result is that until 2004 we stayed with the moderate amount of 167 million.This is equivalent to the expenses that a single German opera theater supports during that same period.Well, in Europe this amount is reserved for 29 countries and a period of 5 years.It is a huge disproportion!Despite our anger, we must be content with the advances obtained in the field of content.It is something that we have made clear and is worthy of gratitude.We hope that one day the council will be convinced and change their attitude.	es
This would jeopardize a greater number of jobs, as well as the credibility of this assembly by showing how far we are from the real world.Consequently, I urged this assembly to reject the entire report and to bring any amendment to the original proposal of the Commission whose balance was excellent.Mr. President, we cannot vote in favor of this report.Indeed, the European Union should put the social to the curled of its construction.It is social rights that should order economic choices and not the other way around.This is why we are opposed to the implementation, concerning social protection, of mechanisms copied to the Luxembourg process which go against this logic: main economic orientations, then criteria of convergence and, finally, the social which is treated in a residual way.The European Union should affirm a general principle: social rights acquired in states cannot be reduced.Any community intervention should aim to complete, then to harmonize from above, the existing guarantees.To strengthen the financing of social protection systems, a policy of general wages are required, the establishment of a legal minimum wage in each of the Member States.To fight poverty, the right to income and the right to employment are inseparable.Finally, to avoid any commodification of health, the European Union should decide clearly against pension funds and oppose that private insurance companies have access to the health system.I really believe, to conclude, that social Europe cannot be satisfied with speeches and vux piles.The situation is too tragic for millions of people.Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, dear colleagues, the objective of developing a concerted strategy to modernize social protection within the European Union is undoubtedly a good thing, in the same way as the kick -off, with the Luxembourg summit, of the European Convergence for Employment and Employment Policy.The job market and social protection are in fact both sides of the same medal which requires that policies and regulations are synchronized.If the job market is effective in terms of employment levels, flexibility and wage efficiency, the Welfare State and social protection cannot be able to be, and vice versa.Previously, European countries each defined on their side, in quasi-approval, the operating and financing rules of the two markets.Budget and exchange policies were there to ensure internal and external balance.With Maastricht and the single currency, budgetary policies have been seriously limited and it is no longer possible to resort to devaluation, to seek lost margins.The structural and cyclical differences between countries can therefore no longer catch up by the deficit and the change.Things being what they are, in the absence of full mobility of employment within the Union and a redistributive tax policy at the confederal level, the only degree of flexibility is left labor and social protection to rectify both structural and cyclical imbalances, what are called asymmetrical exogenous shocks.	fr
"In recent months, from the last time I appeared before the European Parliament, important events have taken place, also in the context of the European Union.I allow myself to remember two, one of which is very welcome to all MEP and in particular to the Presidency: the inauguration of the intergovernmental conference, and the opening of the negotiations with the future members of the European Union.Without a doubt it is necessary to remember the events of Kosovo and in general of the Balkans who have touched our feelings and intelligence;Important issues in the Middle East, where the President of Parliament played a significant role on his last trip;Some important events to unlock the summit between Europe and Africa, in which I had the honor of participating, in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency;The large meeting that took place in Portugal, in Vilaamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America, to try to build deeper relationships even between the European Union and the countries of Latin America.Without a doubt, Cecenia was also at the bottom of our hearts, and at the end of my intervention I will say some words on this, in the light of an important conversation that I had this morning with the representative of the Council of Europe Mr.Álvaro Gil-Robles, on the visit he just accomplished in that region.However, it seems to me that the deputies of this parliament have requested my presence to speak more directly about foreign policy and above all about security policy in Europe after Helsinki.On this theme I will stop briefly;Later, I will answer the questions that the honorable deputies will want to ask me.I was allowed to remember that the Helsinki summit under the Finnish presidency took place just two months ago, and not a century ago.In Helsinki, fundamental decisions for foreign and security policy on our continent were made.These are mainly three types of decisions, and it is to these that I will refer.The first was the decision to constitute, within the European Union, three types of committees for the adoption of decisions regarding the management of crises: firstly, a committee for politics and security;Secondly, a military committee, representing the leaders of Staff of the fifteen countries of the Union;And thirdly, decisions about the relationships that the European Union must entertain with third countries and with other organizations.Basically I refer to the relationships between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and the relationships between the European Union and those countries which, despite being European from a geographical point of view, are not part of the European Union or, at least, not for the moment.I will mainly limit myself to these three points, in order to update the honorable deputies on what happened.In the first place and regarding the decision -making bodies, in the same morning today, 1 March 2000, the Committee for politics and security (Cops), established on the occasion of the last ""General Affairs"" Council for the first time, met for the first time.Therefore, two months after the declaration and decision taken in Helsinki, a meeting of the Cops takes place for the first time in the European Union.This morning I had the opportunity to participate, and to see the representatives at lunchtime."	it
These are the reasons why the orientations are presented according to thematic priorities, because they must be taken into consideration, under each of the objectives, to various degrees according to the specific situations of each of the Member States and the regions.I would now like to respond quickly to some of the observations you made, ladies and gentlemen, on the procedure, first of all.It is true that the consultation of your assembly intervened late.Let me remind you that when the orientations were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a project, in February 1999, following a new procedure intended to facilitate the presentation of comments on this text, they were immediately submitted by my predecessor, Monica Wulf-Mathies, in Parliament.But given the proximity of the European elections, it is, in fact, that after the final adoption of the text, in July 1999, that your assembly was able to undertake the examination of these orientations.Arriving in this college, among you, I want, ladies and gentlemen, to ensure that, in the programs negotiations, which are only in their very beginning, - President Hatzidakis had questioned me on this subject - for most of the Member States, your observations will be really taken into consideration.And I can assure you, moreover that, when the Commission will adopt the orientations with a view to what is called the mid-term revision, as provided for in the regulations, it will also be taken into account from the point of view of your assembly, the one expressed in this report.On the merits now, concerning the role of guidelines, Madam Rapporteur, you stressed that it is in this context that it is a question of providing guidelines on a certain number of European objectives, often very precise.I do not quote them all: the implementation of intersectoral policies, increase the effectiveness of the use of public funds, help the various partners to build together regional or national programming, etc.The Commission takes note of this, but several of these guidelines or these questions are more of other documents such as the Vade-Mecum or the methodological working document.Finally, I would like to focus on certain arrests of which you have echoed, Madam Rapporteur.I think, for example, of the idea that the orientations are not sufficiently specific in their recommendations.This assertion of your report must be submitted in the perspective of last spring negotiations.The Commission has been held in the very text of article 10 of the General Regulations of Structural Funds, which provides that these guidelines are aimed at providing member states with general indicative guidelines, based on relevant and agreed community policies.It is the very text that I quoted, in quotes.In addition, guidelines cannot replace programming or ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify the priorities and efficiency of these programs.You then mentioned, Madam Rapporteur, the section of orientations relating to urban and rural development, stressing that urban development would not be sufficiently taken into account.	fr
We will certainly lift the point mentioned by the Honorable Parliamentarian.We have heard the concerns expressed in this regard and I will ensure that it is taken into account.Considerable concerns have also been expressed about the potential danger that the archaeological heritage of the region ran.We will also lift this last point in the observations that we will formulate.A number of other hydroelectric projects provided by Turkey in the past thirty years have also been concerned, such as the effect they had on moved farmers.Overall, they seem to have been treated in a relatively satisfactory manner and I hope that this will be identical for this project in which the Commission - so that things are clear - does not participate in any way.Question nº 39 of (H-0036/00): Object: Development of the Charter of Fundamental Rights while congratulating, on behalf of all citizens, the development of a charter of fundamental rights, and by forming the view that this will be able to meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century, I would nevertheless wish to ask the Commission the following questions: What are its positions on the content of the Charter?What citizens is this charter intended for (those of the European Union or, with a view to enlargement, of all European countries, includes migrants, etc.)?Will the charter integrate the social achievements of the European Union, or will it have a broader programmatic character?What will be the mechanisms put into work to clearly translate equality between the two sexes in fact?What does the Charter Integration Commission think in the Treaty on the European Union?Like the Honorable Parliamentarian, the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the heads of state and government to launch the process of drafting a charter of fundamental rights of the European Union.The heads of state and government have set themselves, in the conclusions of the Cologne European Council, the main lines of the content of the charter.According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights: rights of freedom, equality and procedure, as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights, the rights reserved for citizens of the Union and economic and social rights, as stated in the European Social Charter and in the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not justify the objectives for the action of the Union.The Commission considers that the convention responsible for the development of the Charter of Fundamental Rights must comply with the mandate given to it by the European Council of Cologne.However, this does not mean that the convention must be limited to a coodifier role of simple compilation of existing rights from different sources.As I have already had the opportunity to say it before this Parliament, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, adapt and develop these rights taking into account current circumstances, in particular technological and social developments.	fr
It is quite essential.It should also be remembered that no one voluntarily renounces power, whether man or woman.Men never wanted to abandon their position of strength when they enjoyed it, but very rare are also the women who were kind enough to abandon their strength position, and I think here in particular their position of strength vis -à -vis children.I would also like to say in this regard that this is perhaps one of the reasons why there are so few men here today.We would of course like to be able to have this debate more or less between us for the same reasons of power policy.What I wanted to emphasize here is that this is a transfer of power on the part of the two parties.The commissioner stressed that it was necessary to use a combination of many different measures, and she cited Finland and Sweden namely.I would simply say for information that she could also have quoted Denmark very well.I obviously say that because I come from Denmark.The Danish government is actually made up of 45 % of women, which is actually slightly higher than Finland.We have, it is true, no president, but we have a queen, which can in a certain sense be considered equivalent.I would now like to approach some of the points cited by the commissioner, namely the question of financial resources.It is absolutely necessary that we accept the fact that, if women want to obtain short -term equality, it will cost money.It is also necessary, in the short term, to seek that our children are kept and educated in a responsible manner.There is therefore the question of adequate structures.One may wonder if traditional industrial culture is really good, and I am therefore very happy with the very active participation of the Portuguese Minister in the Lisbon conference devoted, among other things, to the development of information technologies.I believe that there are possibilities more particularly for women, precisely because there is no question of hierarchy, but rather of horizontal structures.The evolution of things leads to believe, in any case in Denmark, that there are more and more women entrepreneurs.There are two points that have not been mentioned and that I would like to quote to conclude.The first concerns the influence of the media.I think it is very important that we studied stereotypes developed by the media.Does this pose a particular problem?I must say that I don't know precisely.I have the impression that yes, but I am not sure.The second concerns enlargement.I think it is very important in this regard to underline now that we must also set certain requirements so that the new Member States are represented by both men and women, which will also support women in these countries.I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner when she says that it is time for the beautiful speeches to translate into acts.	fr
And I take this occasion to ask if the commission can clarify the reasons for the delay of the commission's report on the ultraperiferic regions, which has been expected in Parliament for a long time.Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the rapporteur, also for the kind reception he has given in his report to some suggestions.Mr. President, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Commissioner, with the help of the guidelines, it is intended to offer the Member States an orientation to achieve the objectives of the reform within the framework of the program.However, the objectives that the commission formulates in this regard, contrary to its purpose of providing guidance, represents a catalog of offers of possible measures within the framework of the fields of politics.However, its authentic meaning is to indicate the address and establish priorities.I agree with the rapporteur that, unfortunately, the commission document contains too much recommendations to member states on administrative simplification and support some demands, such as concentrating attention during negotiations in promoting a favorable environment for small and medium enterprises, so creating employment, in clearly establishincluding new technologies as well as investments in the field of innovation.Special support an amendment from my group to section 10, which aims to ensure adequate inclusion of the private sector in the planning and execution of the projects.I would celebrate a lot, Mrs. Schroedter, that you included this amendment in your positive arguments, precisely also under the aspect of subsidiarity.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, in the Employment and Social Affairs Commission we maintained the unanimous criteria that he had a strategic and priority character to support the interventions of the structural and cohesion funds that will work for a better employment opportunity for the unemployed and for an equality between men and women.Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report has not taken this criterion in consideration despite the fact that there are multiple evidences - and we will see it later in the Berend report - how, indeed, these funds are splendidly helping the most delayed regions to cover the distance that separates them from the most developed regions of Europe.They are growing, but at GDP levels.They are growing in competitiveness, but does not reach all the increase in wealth because employment is not increased and the difference in employment opportunities persists in some regions.Mr. Commissioner, read the opinion of the Employment and Social Affairs Commission and grant it a priority character, because this is the big problem of citizens.And in the review, in the allocation of reserves, keep in mind, strategic, employment needs because that, in short, is what structural funds and cohesion funds require.Mr. President, it is necessary that the guidelines can correctly guide and strengthen the effectiveness of the programs of the Critical Septtenio 2000-2006, so that sustainable development and employment creation, especially feminine and youthful, finally become a reality, and that the balance between social and economic and economic policies is ensured.	es
Will I repeat then?In the wake of the excellent intervention of the rapporteur?that Life represents the only financial instrument for the definition and application of a European environmental policy.It is an essential tool, since it allows you to take actions in the name of innovation in favor of nature and the environment in Europe, which are then taken up and developed by the Member States.Furthermore, this financial instrument is deliberately of democratic inspiration, being accessible to both government organizations and NGOs.It is for this reason, honorable colleagues, that I ask you not to vote for the amendments that have not understood the spirit of Life.Life in fact, through the associations, can be used directly by the European citizen for the benefit of actions of general interest.Several millions?And did I say millions?Of NGO members recognize the will of the Union to build an ambitious policy for the benefit of the natural heritage in Life.Life, moreover, represents the key tool of the Natura 2000 network in Europe, which allows to protect the sites with high biological value of our countries and within which the Member States, in accordance with the EU directives, have committed themselves to the protection of natural habitats of rare and threatened animal and vegetable species, as well as migratory birds.Those who oppose this policy in the individual Member States are guilty, in my opinion, to curb the policies for the protection of nature in Europe, which is a shame, since everyone knows, in this assembly, that Life does not have sufficient financial means for the realization of the projects presented by the Member States, many of which are refused precisely for the lack of funds.Let's not forget that Life represents, at the present time, only 100 million euros per year, equal only to one per thousand of the European budget.As an information, I remember that for agriculture, whose impact on the environment is real, are they allocated?Do we all know?37 billion euros.In this context, my group believes of vital importance to increase the funds allocated for Life and without reserve without reserve the proposal of the honorable Lienemann to increase the sum intended for Life to 850 million euros, since we are all well aware?And I can't help but repeat it?Of the scope of the expectations of our fellow citizens towards the environment and nature and of how hesitant and unacceptable, this compromise of the Council on the Life Budget, especially since the Life programs have seen many projects realized, showing that they are able to introduce new practices in the environmental field.The first sustainable development projects are, without a doubt, precisely those promoted by Life.?(FR) Mr. President, the environmental program of the European Union, which can count on considerable funds (613 million euros), arouses many questions regarding the correct use of public funds.A financial instrument of this magnitude must be transparent and effective, unlike what happens in the case in question for the following reasons: poorly defined selection criteria, ambiguous operations that are not the result of concertation, failure to publish reports, the absence of an evaluation policy.	it
President, dear colleagues!We have to make an important decision today.Does the European Parliament support the ecological principle of producer responsibility, according to which manufacturers are responsible for old vehicles?In amendment application 38, this question is denied by the Christian Democrats: Car manufacturers and drivers should share the costs closely.This compromise does not apply how the guideline on packaging and packaging waste shows such a cost division.Packaging still creates considerable waste quantities in the European Union, which also represent an environmental impact.Some of the socialists led by Bernd Lange describes this principle as correct, but it is not to be introduced until 2010 or 2012 in accordance with amendment.In the common point of view, there is talk of 2006, which, according to the Greens faction, has more than enough time to prepare the automotive industry.Therefore, I call on my colleagues not to support the amendment application 38 of the Christian Democrats and the amendment submission 45 submitted by some socialists.If the car manufacturers have to bear the cost of recycling their vehicles themselves, they will design them accordingly with regard to their easier and cheaper reuse.The problem of using plastics in cars has been dealt with in the future when PVC is replaced by bio -plastic produced from plants, which is ultimately associated with lower costs for consumers.The majority of this parliament tried for 20 years to enforce European environmental policy even more determined.Under the pressure in particular by the German and French automotive industry, this focus is on being lost today.Therefore, I ask you to vote against the amendments 38 and 45.As a parliamentary group of the Greens, we largely support the common point of view.President!The waste of old vehicles represent one of our really big environmental problems, both with regard to the amount of waste and the emission of environmentally harmful substances.We at the Gue/NGL parliamentary group therefore call for this area as comprehensive and consistent regulations as possible.With this guideline we can take a big step forward.However, this presupposes that the advice of the council at the reading in parliament is not dismantled and weakened.However, some of the amendments submitted would have this effect in the event of their assumption.This applies above all to the PPE faction's amendments, but in my opinion unfortunately there are also some amendments from Mr. Lange.It doesn't take much imagination to imagine that the auto industry of certain countries, e.g.B. Germany, before the acceptance of this guideline, did a strong lobbyism.The admission of the following principles is crucial for us: The polluter of the contamination is subject to payment.After that, the manufacturer has to be full responsibility, i.e.h.also take over the financial, for the recycling of the vehicle.There must also be regulations for vehicles in use.We cannot accept that the advice of the council is weakened to the date of entry into force.The demands for recycling after a certain number of years and the corresponding percentages may not be softened.In addition, the use of dangerous substances such as lead must be restricted.We will vote against all amendments that go in the opposite direction in this regard.	de
This is why, dear colleagues, I ask you to support the amendments deposited by Bernd Lange, which will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists because, in fact, they reconcile all the interests in the presence - Economic interests and environmental constraints - while leaving free Member States of the methods of implementing these constraints, since these amendments provide that the systems in place in the Member States,Work quite well, will be able to continue working.Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, the proposal for a directive relating to out -of -use vehicles which occupies us today aims on the one hand to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to preserve the proper functioning of the internal market in this sector.A word to say that, of course, historic and period vehicles must be excluded from the scope of this directive.The cars, we will all agree on this, I think, are also part of our cultural heritage.That said, one of the stumbling blocks relates to article 12, that is to say the date of application of the directive.The solution proposed by Parliament, namely 18 months after the date of entry into force of this directive, for vehicles put on the market the first time, is unrealistic.The European car fleet has several tens of millions of cars that will have to be taken up without having been designed to be recycled.The common position was more passable since it provided 2006 for vehicles already in circulation.This would also allow businesses to make funds for funds to meet these additional expenses.I will therefore support, in this regard, like my group, the common position which presents a balanced compromise, it seems to me, between the constraints of companies and the essential advanced in the protection of the environment.Mr. President, dear colleagues, the European Parliament is today faced with an important decision.Are we committing ourselves in favor of environmental protection and consumers who are carrying the future or the Parliament accepts, as the Florenz, Lange and others amendments to become the valet of the German automotive industry?The credibility of the Parliament, one of the pioneers of environmental protection, is at stake. It would be more than scandalous than the PE returns to what the governments of the 14 Member States have proposed and the European Commission in matters of producer and environmental protection.The intention underlying the proposals of amendment Florenz and Lange is clear: it is necessary to annihilate this directive.The proposal for shared responsibility should empty its substance the principle of responsibility and undermine any innovation.By drawing many obstacles, they want nothing more than a policy of managing the flows of materials that are effective on the ecological level;Via approaches, they want to delay twelve years or more the implementation of directives.It is completely unacceptable.I therefore launch a particular appeal to German parliamentarians: do not allow today a political disaster.The red-green government coalition was not covered with glory during the debate on the directive on out of use vehicles.	fr
However, let me clarify one thing on behalf of my faction: Social convergence strategies must not be an alternative to social legislation, but can only present a rather useful addition to what we develop and what we expect from the Commission in relation to social legislation.The European Parliament should also try to convince the Council to specify the common strategy in Lisbon and to get an annual procedure to combat poverty at the beginning of 2001.To my delight, the European Parliament is given to this idea of ​​my faction, and hopefully, Ms. Commissioner, we can also expect your support.Finally, we urge that the European Parliament as well as the social partners and the NRO in the social affairs are definitely involved in this process.This strategy should only be successful with a broad, democratic basis, and therefore we hope for your support.Mr President, in November last year, four main goals were decided by the governments of the EU countries that have already been mentioned today: It must be ensured that it is worthwhile to have work and a fixed income that the pensions are safe and the pension systems are sustainable, that the social integration is promoted and that one ensures a sustainable health care system of high quality.These are four goals that are so comprehensively formulated that they can be supported by everyone.And we can only use it if we commission a group of top civil servants with the exchange of experiences to coordinate and evaluate development within social and labor market policy.The communication of the Commission, which we discuss today, was the basis of the Council decision in November and, in a balanced form, represents how the debates can become more qualified, how we can gain more knowledge about the challenges with which Member States are confronted in the area of ​​social policy in the coming years.B. to the increasing aging - and where we will feel the effects of the expansion.There are already major social problems today, and public budgets have to bear high social costs, which is a problem for many Member States.If no reforms are carried out, there is a risk that the financial basis of social policy deteriorates.A strong and competitive economy is the best basis for social security.Therefore, it is reasonable to put these topics on the agenda.In the discussion about the coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression of social convergence.We can support the term social convergence when it comes to designing common general objectives within the EU that the federal states want to meet with their national social policy.So this is not about harmonization, but about common goals.The EU countries organize their social policy in different ways.Our traditions are different, there are differences in our culture, and despite many points of contact, there are also big differences between the countries in terms of the type and scope of social problems.Therefore, it must be emphasized that social policy is a national matter.Social policy must of course adhere to a number of common framework conditions.	de
Therefore, an upper limit for administrative tasks must be set.The committee pulled conclusions from these critical remarks.We placed particular emphasis on linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social area, in tourism and in small and medium -sized companies with the promotion of start -ups in small and medium -sized companies taking into account the necessary economic structural change.The integration of activities as part of the community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a decisive prerequisite for achieving the task of the Equal program.We strongly support the innovative approach of the formation of international development partnerships and the organization of the exchange of experiences at European level as an integrative part of the Equal program.The special goal, the achievement of a European benefit, raises regional cooperation to the European level, while maintaining the cooperation of a wide variety of regional actors.This is a good thing, and that's why we approved it.Mr President, my dear ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues!Today it has already been pointed out that the first urban initiative was clearly successful.The fact that this initiative is now continued within the framework of Urban II, albeit with lower center equipment, we owe only committed members of this parliament, especially - as far as I heard this as a new member of this parliament - also the rapporteur Ms. McCarthy, who I would like to thank for this commitment and of course also for her report on Urban II.New to the Urban II initiative is that it has been tailored to small cities or districts.This is important because small cities in particular often have worse opportunities to get funding.On the other hand, however, the problems that lead to strong renewal needs can concentrate particularly in such cities and have a strong negative effect.In order to increase the effectiveness of the individual measures, the number of projects for Urban II was limited to 50.I think it is important not to keep this arbitrarily set numerical limitation, but to leave it up to the Member States how many projects they want to divide on the funding they are entitled to.However, it is important to ensure that in small Member States, especially in again, districts of large cities will enjoy the funding.There, Urban II would only be a drop on the hot stone, of doubtful success and dignity.In my opinion, it is also important not to excessively expand the selection criteria for Urban II and thereby water them down.A strictly deliberate criteria catalog in particular is a prerequisite for the funded projects to have a model character and will be transferable to other problem cities in the future.From my own municipal political experience in an old -industrialized region with many problems, I would like to finally ask you, dear colleagues, especially for the support of two points of the report, which I think is essential in addition to the socio -political aspects.First: The aspect of environmental protection is indispensable for sustainable urban development and should therefore be a general prerequisite for project funding.Second: Prevention and combating urban everyday crime and drug procurement crime must start at the local level.They are indispensable to increase the urban quality of life and must therefore also play a central role in the Urban II initiative.	de
On the national level, we believe that the taxation of work and businesses be reduced, to join levels equivalent to those which are used in competing countries of ours, but this question is the responsibility of the Swedish parliament, and not of the European Parliament.The fact that several countries are looking for various solutions in terms of tax policy and social protection gives the possibility of adapting them to national specificities and of testing different social protection systems.Tax harmonization on the scale of Europe should only intervene in exceptional cases, for example for certain taxes related to the environment or relating to capital.We agree to estimate that a certain degree of harmonization is necessary for the internal market to be able to operate, but we believe that amendment 4 goes far too far, and that it is missing by too many nuances.Common resolution on the sinking of the Erika (RC B5-0181/2000) Mr. President, we voted the resolution concerning the sinking of Erika by solidarity with the victims of this ecological disaster.However, we denounce the horror of the resolution.To be content to deplore the disaster and complain about its victims, without taking constraint measures to oblige total to repair all the direct and indirect consequences of pollution for which it is entirely responsible, it is nothing to do.It is revolting that Total leaves the volunteers and local authorities to repair the damage he has caused.It is just as revolting as it is the state that unlocks funds, moreover insufficient, which is only a subsidy disguised to this company with criminal actions.To be content to wave only the question of pavilions of complacency is to elude the essential.Whatever the pavilion of convenience that Total uses, the culpable oil company is widely known and present in all the countries of the European Union and the authorities concerned could, if they wanted, put all its goods on sequests until the company pays.And we especially want to denounce this economy where, to make additional profit, a company can pollute a region as it can ruin it by factories.Mr. President, on behalf of the Breton Democratic Union, the Breton partner of the European Free Alliance, and in my personal name, I ask that a real policy be adopted in order to avoid new disasters such as the sinking of the Erika.The regulations and the means of control must not only be stricter, they must also be subject to rigorous application.We clearly made it clear that a series of actors had to make the floor to make sure that the Erika was the last ecological nightmare of the Breton coast.It is already the seventh time that a black tide hits Brittany from the sinking of the Torry Canyon.No other region of the world had to pay such a heavy price to transport polluting or dangerous products by sea.	fr
Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, I would first like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur and also point out that she is not satisfied, in her report, to salute the proposal for a framework decision-making, but that she also offers some modifications that have been highlighted in the various interventions that we have heard, modifications which complete or improve the initial text, but which we cannot all mention in detail.Anyway, it is a question of guaranteeing the success of the Euro.We must therefore do everything in our power so that this success is not threatened or questioned by insufficient protective measures against false coinage - and we are aware of the first attempts in the matter.We have all noted that the transition phase generates many uncertainties and dangers.In addition to the work accomplished against falsifications, and the regular execution of the provisions, the information campaign planned must therefore play an essential role.We still have to devote ourselves intensively.These are also cooperation issues.We need a definition of specific skills of the ECB, national central banks, the commission as well as Europol for everything related to the falsification of the euro.I also wonder if it should not be created an interinstitutional or community organization responsible for ensuring coordination in terms of cooperation.In this regard, we are also talking about setting up an early alert system that would work 24 hours a day and to erect a common information system allowing a rapid exchange of information between the various competent authorities.In addition to this report, whose content we greet, it remains to clarify many questions.I hope that the debate we hold here will provide some of these clarifications.Mr. President, Madam Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, to what extent is the euro a safe currency?This is a question that is very frequently asked by the population.This question will of course be asked in a more and more pressing way as we approach 01.01.2002, the date on which the Euro will be found in all the wallets.This question relating to the security of the euro does not only concern the stability and external value of this currency, but also its protection against false coinage.These are questions that also affect the population, because this money will be, as has just been said, a novelty for the citizens of the Union, both for the eyes and for the hands that will manipulate them.The fact that this currency will be valid on a much larger territory and will be used as the main currency throughout Europe will also be a novelty for European citizens.We will have to get used to it.It is therefore clear that we are asked the question in order to know what the EU undertakes to protect the euro from the counterfeiters.This is what we debate during this night session.It is truly a subject that is closely interested in the citizen.It is therefore regrettable that he was discussed at such a late hour.But it must be so.Obviously, the European Central Bank has been seized of this issue for a very long time.	fr
"In addition, the Court thinks, honor, that the transfer made between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of rational exploitation and responsible for living marine and aquatic resources, since fishing pressure in subdivisions 8 and 9 does not increase or negatively affect the global fee of those resources attributed to Spain.In accordance with this, the Council reiterates, honor, his opinion that, without that transfer, the possibilities of French fishing regarding the boquerrón in the Vizcaya Gulf would increase.Therefore, the Council reiterates, honor, its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and would be more harmful to population units than the solution by which it was in the end.Specifically, 3,000 tons represent 57.5% of Portugal's fishing possibilities in 2000, compared to 5,008 tons, or 73.9%, in 1999. These figures represent, in our opinion and from the perspective of the Council, a real improvement from the point of view of conservation, if we compare them with the level of 80% established in the Regulation of Council 685/95.QUESTION Nº 6 Asked by (H-0788/99): Subject: Measures to stop the persistent ethnic cleaning against the Serbian and Gypsy ethnic groups in Kosovo the Summit of Ministers of Defense of NATO made 2.12.1999 an energetic call to cease ethnic cleaning against the ethnic minorities of Kosovo.Also the European Parliament, through a resolution in which it refers to certain acts of violence of the odious nature perpetrated against the Serbian and Gypsy population, firmly condemns the persistent violence against the Serbian population of Kosovo and asks the leaders of the Albankosovar community to fully respect the 1244 resolution of the United Nations.The resolution also highlights that the persecutions suffered in the past by the Albanian population cannot constitute ""a pretext for the continuation of deaths, kidnappings, arrests, abuse of power, acts of harassment and intimidation, premeditated fires, looting, destruction of goods and housing occupation.""Taking into account the above, is the Council proposed to reconsider the financing for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as requested by the European Parliament?What other practical measures do you think to adopt ethnic cleaning?Honor, I would like to say that I feel the greatest sympathy for the underlying concern to the issue he has raised.We really share the concerns that their honor feels about the threat situation that exists within Kosovo for ethnic minorities, either in relation to the Serbian population or in relation to the Zingara population, and the aspects of discrimination, siege and intimidation that continue to occur in that territory.The Council has always underlined the need to judge all who perpetrated such acts and those who continue to perpetrating them.The Council also reiterated, in its conclusions in December, the need for the full application of resolution 12/99 of the Security Council and has systematically supported the efforts carried out by Mr. Bernard Kouchner in the sense of applying the measures that can entail the guarantee that in that territory there is an effective protection of minorities and, in particular, an effective application of measures that allow the preservation of the preservation of the multiethnic nature of that territory.In the contacts we have maintained with the most prominent political personalities of the Albanians of Kosovo, which made the Portuguese prime minister very recently, we have highlighted that persecutions to Serbian populations, to populations of gypsy ethnicity and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable."	es
It would be good if the Union reconsider the reallocation of the funds of environmental projects to better support the sustainable development of politics in the field of water.With regard to this directive proposal, it is worrying that the amendments considered by the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection have not sufficiently taken the importance of the purity of the surface waters to increase the natural spaces with clean groundwater veins.In Finland, surface waters are very clean.The artificial production of groundwater is an ecological formula of filtering clean surface water to complete groundwater reserves.This process is carried out without the need for chemical treatment plants.The directive should not endanger this activity.In discrepancy with the common position of the Council, the Environment Commission also tries to limit further the possibilities of making water transfers.This would be problematic for countries whose water reserves are distributed heterogeneously.Trans transfers that are ecologically sustainable should not be limited by community norms.Activities in this sense must continue to be controlled through norms and have due authorization, but the same provisions are not applicable, for example, to Finland and a country that suffers droughts such as Greece.Mr. President, Mrs. curator, water is an invaluable natural good, indispensable for some vital functions, and it is our duty to protect it.I consider that a framework directive on water policy in the European Union is essential, that it is the basic legal instrument to improve the quality and for the correct administration of hydraulic resources, and I give my congratulations to the rapporteur for the effort made to solve this thorny issue and to reconcile all the opinions.But I must mention that there are differences in the issue of water between the countries of the north and those of the South, so the same solution cannot be given.There are regions of Europe with a structural lack of water and this must be taken into account.In recent years, because of climatic changes, the countries of the Mediterranean basin are facing serious problems due to floods or drought.Mr. President, we agree with the common position;But we also accept quite amendments that have been presented whose goal is to improve it.But we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of the calculation of the water cost because in my country, a large number of users are farmers.In addition, the amendments that do not allow the water to transport from a river basin to another, would condemn many regions of my country to the lack of water.I believe that the issue of eliminating hazardous substances must be considered with a realistic base to solve it.As for the time needed to apply the directive, it should be taken into account that there are countries where infrastructure, to apply this directive, requires significant time and resources.Mr. President, I believe that despite making these observations, the common objective of sustainable use of hydraulic resources is maintained.	es
European postal services in accordance with the agenda, the oral question (B5-0010/2000) of Mr. Hatzidakis is debated, on behalf of the Regional Policy Commission, Transport and Tourism, to the Commission, on European postal services.Mr. President, the postal sector is still a sector in which it is allowed to act to the old and outdated monopolies, without competition.This has been like that for too long, for the absence of an energetic commission in this sector.In all other sectors the community authorities that ensure the competition have intervened, but not here.We have waited in vain proposals from the commission for eighteen months.I would like the commission to answer this question today: when will we have new and modern postal services, which can work throughout the EU?One of the most important community principles is the internal market.We are working intensely to expand it, so that you understand more member countries.This requires efficiency, and efficiency implies competition.Today the liberalization and deregulation of all sectors is demanded.Often, the EU goes to the avant -garde in this process.The Commission promotes this development in an exemplary way.The commission does it because we have many experiences of old monopolies incapable of giving good service, such as the one demanded by a modern society.He also does so to follow technological development.In addition, the commission does so to be able to lower prices, in the conviction that this is easier to achieve in a free market and subject to competition rules.This is in a series of sectors;Unfortunately, so far, with the great exception of postal services.I don't think it's precisely because customers are satisfied.We all know that criticisms for prices increases and delays in the distribution of letters are a constant discussion issue.If we are really interested in having an internal market that works, we cannot continue making exceptions with the activities of postal services.Some countries have advanced more quickly and created the conditions for the existence of a freer competition in the postal sector.The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden are the ones that have gone further.These countries have demonstrated during the last decade that some benefits can be achieved.In Sweden, in addition, this development has been gradually producing, in an environment of great political coincidence.It is important that this process can continue and give it the necessary stimuli.Experience indicates that old monopolies are not able to provide services that work as all of us, customers, we have the right to demand.Given the proximity of this debate, the supporters of the continuation of the monopoly have sent a letter.In it they refer to Sweden as lesson.Possibly these criticism could be made in a series of situations, but not just in this area.It has been stated in a circular letter that the price of stamps has risen 59 percent since liberalization in 1993. It is true, if we only see this with the condition that only 20 percent of the total postal market has been taken into account, in which still, in practice, there is monopoly, that is, in which the State is the only actor.	es
A point relating to the impact on companies is of all particular importance, as the honorable Thyssen, Peijs and Palacio Vallersundi recalled: the SMEs.Many honorable parliamentarians have insisted on this aspect.The Commission is pursuing with particular attention the issue of legal security for SMEs.The system that we propose significantly improves legal security for SMEs.Why?Is it just a political move?No, in the context of the system we propose to reform the material rules in such a way that most of the SMEs will be covered by the exemption regulations by category, as in the case of vertical constraints;The majority of SMEs, in fact, holds less than 30% of the market shares.We thought of a de minimis notification that contains a declaration on the basis of which the SMEs, as a rule, are not subject to the severe prohibition referred to in article 81, paragraph 1, not existing for these companies the problem of the dominant market position.We are continuing to work on other exemption regulations by category and directors who will take into account the main situation of SMEs globally, first of all by eliminating the bureaucratic effects of the current notification system and, secondly, making article 81, paragraph 3 immediately applicable, particularly to the advantage of SMEs.The fourth question is that of legal security.Of course, legal security, honorable Evans - are the first to recognize it - is important for companies, not only for the legal professions that also play a very important role in favor of European construction.Legal security is important for companies: this is a theme of which also in its latest intervention the president of the legal commission and for the internal market, honorable Palacio Vallelersundi which I am very grateful for as always follows the themes of the single market in a broad sense, therefore, in this case, including the competition underlined the importance.I am convinced that this proposal will increase the legal security of companies, and this for three reasons: it will allow to authorize, without prior decision, by virtue of the direct effect of article 81, paragraph 3, all the restrictive agreements of the competition that meet the conditions of exemption;will create the possibility of assisting companies in case of interpretative doubt through the publication of motivated opinions;It will be accompanied by exemption regulations and directors destined to clarify the rules and ensure its certainty.(FR) Mr Thyssen also referred to the legal privilege for business jurists.Allow me to remember that the Court of Justice has deliberated on this question, like you better than me you know, in 1982. That jurisprudence remains valid and there is nothing that justifies the restoration.The White Paper requires a review of the question limited to one aspect: the exchange of confidential information.The guarantees that must be given to companies are currently subject to discussion.I am now, Mr. President, quickly to the report of the Honorable Rapkay, to whom my heartfelt thanks goes for the quality of his work and for the support that is basically given to the XXVIII annual report of the Commission on the competition policy.	it
"Secondly, we must maintain the data as established in the common position.Thus, as of 2006, delivery without costs of all vehicles, without costs for the last owner.This, of course, is an extremely essential point, which is not likely to be modified.Is this too heavy?There is one thing that we should not forget.The directive deals with entire vehicles, that is, vehicles that do not lack any essential part.There are few whole cars, in the opinion of the specialists, who have no value.Because the recycling, the reuse of components, is a sector that should not necessarily generate losses, on the contrary, at this time there are a lot of companies that live from that and that are won properly.The directive stimulates this entire sector, which is a sector of small and medium enterprises.Since transport costs are high, it will be necessary to implement a totally decentralized system, because moving scrap more than 100 kilometers is not a profitable activity.I think it is positive that the directive does not apply to historical vehicles, and I think we must add it.Thus, period vehicles, the ""Oldtimers"", in my view, must be exempt.It is also good that we clearly attribute responsibility for manufacturers.It constitutes a basic principle that we must maintain.They are responsible for the Concepción phase.Therefore, they can do a lot for the environment through this phase of conception.We also have to continue supporting that the costs, in its entirety or largely, as established in the common position, are in charge of the manufacturers.I think it is a balanced formula that does not exclude another series of aspects.I think we must keep it.Therefore, our group will attend as much as possible to the common position and will not modify this common position in its essential aspects.Because, of course, we all know that this common position has been reached with many difficulties, that a very difficult balance exercise has been carried out to achieve it.For our part, I consider that we cannot endanger this common position, because it is a directive that we need at all costs for environmental reasons.I ask you to support this common position.Our group, in any case, will do everything possible to do so, for environmental reasons, and because we have this directive, and because it is a balanced directive that contains a lot of elements, a large number of objections, for example, the distribution of costs.Mr. President, Deputies, today we must make a very important decision.If the European Parliament supports the ecological principle of responsibility of the manufacturer, this will mean that vehicle manufacturers will also be responsible for vehicles at the end of their useful life.No, they say the democraticristians in the amendment 38: vehicle manufacturers and motorists must half share costs.With the directive on the packaging, where this compromise of half -cast was reached, it could be seen that the solution did not work."	es
And this is where the paradox is.The convergence of political and monetary Europe inevitably leads to the convergence of the rules of the labor markets of labor and social protection.At the same time, however, the single currency, combined with the lack of employment mobility and a redistributive tax policy, forces us to do the non-convergence of wages and social protection to compensate for the differences in productivity between countries and regions.It is not hypocrisy and beautiful words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernization and consultation that will get us out of these contradictions.Or the European Union becomes an authentic federal state, with real redistributive taxation, real mobility of employment and therefore, and from this moment only, with common rules in terms of employment and social protection, or it is better not to make vain promises and not to make illusions on the impossible pathways of convergence, a principle that sounds well, but which causes harm, especially to the most deprived.We would do well to become aware of it.Mr. President, unlike some of my colleagues intervened in today's debate, I tend to approve the Andersson report, among others because I see very clear differences in relation to the Commission's communications.I am notably aware that this report defends the solidarity approach to the European social model - and I want to congratulate the rapporteur for this.I would like to emphasize clear positions against social dumping, as well as the right to minimal social protection, the objective of social convergence and, more particularly, on what is very concretely mentioned in terms of equal opportunities and objectives of social policy.I also note the shortcomings with regard to insufficiently coherent consideration of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, a policy which hinders this joint-joint owner of the European social model.Overall, however, I consider this positive report.Mr. President, I speak to speak, by reaffirming it, of the need to modernize social protection more as an instrument than as one more step towards European construction.This is how Mr. Andersson's report underlines, which seems excellent to me.Europe, the European Union, although it is very strong in the economic and political field, will become a lame, weak and limited, perhaps short, if we do not manage to make it strong in the social field.I think that this last point implies employment possibilities for those who ask for it and a firm action in favor of socially lower people.Considering that anyone has the right to social protection and a guaranteed minimum social income, I think that we must not forget the case of those who were not born within the European Union.Remember that in 1999, 717,000 people came to compensate for our low birth rate.This is why, in social order, an immigration policy endowed with social conscience is absolutely necessary, as the Gutierres president recently declared it in Spain.	fr
Finally, the Commissioner, we cannot forget that there are still major economic sectors which are still strongly in the public domain, which go from public televisions to be funded by taxpayers or from postal services to certain compulsory insurance, including insurance-maladie and social insurance, managed by ineffective public monopolies which offer no salvation to members.The commissioner, I know perfectly the constraints of the treaties, but I believe that it is important here to repeat that the European economy suffers from American competition, also and above all because of the lack of openness and competition.What we do now is probably very important but it is still insufficient.Mr. President, by definition, a white paper is not to be taken or to leave, but is intended to arouse reactions.From this point of view, the white paper is a success.It represents a good basis for discussion and it is therefore necessary to give it a good welcome.I understand what were the views of the authors at the beginning of their study and I join them.I also start from the principle that you, the Commissioner, want to honor your reputation, as well as to the work accomplished by your predecessors, and that your services also share the same objective.I cannot imagine that the Commission could take initiatives which would have the result to deviate from European integration and renationalize.However, I make concern for myself and I ask myself questions.I first question myself about the coherent application of politics.I am generally an ardent supporter of cultural diversity but not in terms of the culture of competition in the domestic market.The internal market needs a competition policy that is uniform, not only in its concept, but also in its implementation.European regulations are certainly enacted and communications as to their interpretation are actually transmitted.The Commission should also have a right of evocation and it should indicate guidelines to the national authorities in charge of competition.However, I wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in an Echternach procession, where for two steps forward, we make one back each time.I would therefore like to learn a little more about the way in which the commission intends to guarantee in practice the uniform application of the proposed policy and if you consider that the tracks described from point hundred of the white paper can be followed in a realistic way.Secondly, I understand the concerns of businesses about legal certainty.Many files are precisely introduced from this perspective.However, this instrument will disappear in the future.Do you say in the White Paper that the Commission will issue some individual provisions which will be able to serve as guidelines, but what will be your criteria to sometimes grant and sometimes refuse such specific developments?Thirdly, I want to know if the Commission examined what would be the consequences of its new approach to business strategy.I worried in particular as to the fate of small and medium -sized enterprises that will lose part of the legal and economic protection they have, as is the case with the new exemption by category in the distribution sector.	fr
But, despite all these virtues, the Regulation of Life III Falla, Mr. President, Ladies, in what is obviously more important for the repercussions of a financial instrument: its budget.The Commission and the Council, by persisting in its proposal of 613 million euros as a reference amount for the period 2000-2004 and by impossible the proposal of the European Parliament of 850 million euros, adopt a decision that, in our opinion, is not based on the same criteria of rationality and justice that they introduced, in other provisions of LIFE III.For our part, the Commission and the Council must know that we do not abdicate to provide Life with the budget that deserves and that better guarantees the environmental results that are intended to be obtained with an instrument of this type, we justify this option of ours with four very simple arguments.First, Life is the only direct financial instrument for the promotion of environmental policy in the European Union.There is no other.Secondly, Life is an instrument that has given good results, has allowed the development of innovative methods and techniques and has an excellent execution rate.Third, Life's budget has decreased in real terms and has not followed the enormous dynamics and creativity of demand.Fourth, Parliament, given the merit attributed to Life, has registered in its annual budget increasing endowments for this program, so the approval of the proposal defended by the Council and the Commission would mean an unacceptable investment of that trend.But our concern does not lie only in the budgetary issue.The amendments about the weather and the water policy refer to matters that concern European citizens a lot and that have deserved very large attention from this assembly.Therefore, for us the approval of our amendments no.5 and 6, aimed at assigning the sustainable management of groundwater and surface, as well as the reduction of greenhouse gas, as objectives to be achieved with Life Environment.Some last words to congratulate Mrs. Lienemann for her report and take advantage of the opportunity to tell him that we will vote in favor of her amendments on the committee, given that - despite what we prefer, as it was very clear in the Environment Commission, that the follow -up of Life was in charge of an advisory committee - we do not want to contribute to the viabilization of the solution proposed by the Council, which is frankly worse.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, Ladies, I want to congratulate Mrs. Lienemann for the report she has made, and also to the commission - why not - because this report, this position, improves in general terms the current texts.In addition, it has a more acceptable systematic and is clearer and clearer.I also want to congratulate the services of the Commission, since the evaluation, control and monitoring of the Life program reasonably guarantee the selection and execution of the projects.	es
"Mr Parliamentary, the answer I gave her was the only one as possible.However, I would like to specify the following: the interpretation that is given of article 255 of the Treaty must also be connected to the principle of subsidiarity.Currently there is no concrete proposal that allows us to work on the regulation of this article, and in the absence of such a proposal it is not possible to proceed in this matter.In any case, at a first reading, it can be said that article 255 does not allow to work on a base that can harm the principle of subsidiarity.I am basically interested in understanding how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam, aimed at guaranteeing citizens a greater possibility of participation in the decision -making process.As we can, since at the same time in the proposal of the commission - it has leaked, therefore it is known to the public - it is said that the freedom of thought of the officials has the priority on the opening, that it is not possible to have access to work documents, relationships, drafts, etc.?Does the representative of the Council not think that this makes participation in the democratic decision -making process difficult?Mr Parliamentary, the question she raised is of the utmost importance and we discussed it for a long time during the last intergovernmental conference.I would like to tell you one thing: transparency not only serves in the relationships of the Community institutions ""outward"", but also ""between"" Community institutions.That is to say that there are elements relating to the form and process of operating the Community institutions that are not accessible to other institutions, and it is not only the Commission's report with respect to Parliament, but also with respect to the Council.This theme has been addressed and discussed several times at the time.The European Parliament will have the opportunity to be part of the preparatory group of the next intergovernmental conference.The question is still open.The presentation and real transparency of the functioning of institutions at European level is a theme of the utmost importance that requires, in my opinion, to be analyzed in another location, in particular in the context of the next intergovernmental conference.On this we do not have the slightest doubt and we think that the parliamentarians who will be part of this preparatory group will have the opportunity to still raise the problem.I believe that the proposal made by the Commission must contain elements that allow greater transparency in relation to the functioning of the various institutions, but I think there is always room for making improvements on the subject.For our part, we are willing to analyze the proposals that will emerge in this area.The question posed by the honorable Sjöstedt and from others it is very important.In Sweden there is a principle of advertising of the acts that strengthens democracy and which guarantees a good dialogue between citizens, authorities and decision -making centers.It is enormously at heart that the union can also be walked in the same direction, as specified in the Treaty of Amsterdam.One or two years ago, Parliament has adopted a very important relationship of honorable Lööw in this context.The report warned against the risk that that imminent process could lead to limitations of the advertising level of the acts existing in the various countries."	it
His votes, Messrs. Colegas, in favor of the entire report, as supported by the Fisheries Commission, will constitute a very important part of a broader package of AIS control, based on the reality of the Scottish situation and the lessons learned from the success of others.I congratulate Mr. Hudghton and completely support his report and urge his distinguished ladies to do the same.As he has said, fish farming is an essential source of employment in some peripheral places of rural Scotland, and at a time when rural Scotland is undergoing the greatest recession of the last hundred years, aquaculture exercises an essential impulse on the rural economy, on directly and indirectly depends many thousands of jobs.Currently, as said, more than 85,000 tons of salmon are now produced in Scottish fish farms, an industry that generates more than 800 million euros.Unfortunately, despite the fact that AIS was first detected in Scotland two years ago, it has now extended directly to 29 fish farms and around another 240 are affected in one way or another.It has been determined that salmon, trout and wild eels are carriers of the virus that now seems to be endemic in the largest marine environment.But I must say that despite the alarmism of the greens it should be noted that AIS is not transmitted, under any circumstance, to humans and I have to repeat what was said by Mr. Hudghton about the virus cannot survive above the 25th - that is, the human temperature - it is a cold waters.However, in infected fish it can cause considerable weight losses and premature death in its advanced states and therefore has had a serious impact throughout the Scottish aquaculture sector, assuming a cost for the industry of around 60 to 70 million losses derived from the premature mandatory sacrifice and other eradication measures.So, Mr. President, this report provides a stimulant range of proposals to improve the way in which the authorities of the United Kingdom and other places should respond to this disease.When recommending the introduction of a method of progressive containment and sacrifice, similar to the system used successfully in Norway, the speaker pursues the application of a more flexible treatment of the disease that will generate greater confidence, not only in the insurance sector, which to date has clearly refused to grant any type of coverage due to the insistence on a mandatory sacrifice policy.When recommending the development of research and the final use of vaccines to control and eradicate AIS, the rapporteur also comforts the pharmaceutical industry that has not arranged for any incentive to invest in the development of a vaccine.Thus, I completely recommend this excellent report and I trust that Parliament will grant your support.I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Hudghton, for this report.Scottish salmon fish farming is the largest in the European Union and represents 90% of the British aquaculture industry.The industry lies in some of the most peripheral communities in Europe and provides a means of life to these communities.	es
First, every European port has to build reasonable port ripens for ship waste if he does not yet have it.So there must be them.Second, all ships, regardless of their flag, have to dispose of their waste.Third: The costs must be borne by the ship.We agree on that.We want to reach a system together to avoid that there is economic incentives to pour the waste into the sea.Firstly, we want to protect flora and fauna and secondly there are many coasts where tourists are happy and jobs are to be created on the one hand.That means we want to have an effective system.Where do we differ from the council, apart from little things that we want to exclude the museum ships from the bureaucratic regulations, and that we are a bit strict with large fishing ships and sports boats?The really decisive difference is the question, how do you load the disposal costs to the ship?The colleague Bouwman has already explained it.There are two experiences: one in the Baltic Sea area, and this is not a national experience, but the experience of the entire Baltic Sea area, and which says that if you cover a large part of the disposal costs over the general port fees, there is no incentive to dispose of the ship's waste in the sea.If you have already paid the disposal, you can also dispose of in the harbor.The other system is the pure cause principle: if you base ship waste, you have to pay extra.This second system has proven to be ineffective because why is the Mediterranean so dirty?Why is the North Sea so dirty?Because the cause principle does not work due to a lack of reasonable controls!That is why the committee said with a lot of majority -no majority, the representatives of the minority opinion will comment -as the parliament in the first reading, without any dispute, without any dispute that the No Special Fee system is the better system, because it offers the ships of economic incentive, so to speak, not to pour the crap into sea, but to dispose of it in reasonable harbor fishing systems.That is the crucial question.We are ready to agree with the council.But the Council has so far rejected every serious agreement with us.Therefore, I appeal to the house, our application, according to which essential parts of up to 90 % must be covered by the general port fees.Because then we have the opportunity to agree with the Council in the mediation committee procedure, be it 75 % or whatever.Therefore my request to the Commission: Mrs. Vice President, be careful which page you stand on!I think in the interest of environmental protection, a long -term, flourishing tourism industry in many countries in our community, it is better to have an effective system.Therefore, support our NO Special Fee system.Perhaps we will then achieve a reasonable compromise with the council in the placement process.President!I am pleased that you are leading this debate, I know that as a Bayer you always give the ports and the oceans an open ear, and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Theo Bouwman, for the work he did and also for working with us in the run -up to tomorrow.	de
How do you describe it?What is a recognized minority?Regarding the political decision, I would also like to ask who makes the political decision.Is it the commission?Is it the advice?To what extent can the European Parliament be able to play a role in this process?What is the role of scientific committees?And what will be the next role of the food authorities that you are going to put in place?Finally, this decision-making will be made in a transparent and public manner?These are my three questions.Yes, Mr. President, that's right.There have been many complex subjects that were not always absolute clarity, but I will try to answer certain questions.Who will make the decision?Who are political decision -makers?Well, it depends on the legislators.This is part of risk management.They must take into account, for example, citizens' concerns about a particular subject, and they must form an opinion on the basis of scientific evidence in a specific case.But it is true that the use of the precautionary principle does not depend on the vast majority of the scientific community.It can be used on the basis of evidence from a minority or when science is not complete.Of course, this is where we establish a balance between this principle as a political instrument and science.It is not always easy to precisely describe the course of this process, but there is no question of changing the scientific base.We consult the experts in order to bring together as much information and facts as possible before making a decision, and this is what we will also have to do in the future.You must consider this as a risk management tool.You must choose: Either you put citizens in danger, for example, or you want to protect the environment, and you must take into account the available science.You have to assess all of this and assess science.Then you decide whether or not to take a measure, whether or not to undertake an action.So there is no answer to all your questions, but that does not change the scientist system or the expert system that we use today.Mr. President, I have a question in relation to a concrete and current case, in which the precautionary principle could apply.It concerns the delayers of flame in bromine.It is a fact that these substances are now detected;We discover growing concentrations in men and in the environment.Many claim the fact that they have significant risks, while others question the importance of the risks linked to these substances.Recently, Sweden and Denmark have urged the Commission through the Council of Ministers to take an initiative in order to prohibit the delayers of flame in Brome.I therefore ask myself the question of whether you are preparing such a ban and if taking such an initiative would not be suitable very well, in your eyes, to the precautionary principle itself.	fr
"This applies in the area of ​​globalization.Globalization enables a higher increase in assets, an increase in international trade and productivity.However, the deregulated globalization, as it exists today, or globalization, in the broad circles of the world population, do not benefit extensive investments in people, is also a factor of exclusion, division and the widening of the trench between rich and poor.This applies in the knowledge society that pave the way for a new equal opportunities, but also an increasingly sharp separation between those who have access to it, and that can accuse those who are denied access, as is the case with the relationships between the old and the new economy.Incidentally, it is not the first time that a technological transition takes place that changes the paradigm of society and the business organization.In such profound transition phases, the problems, especially the employment problems of the old economy, are solved through the use of the new economy and its instruments.I give an example: in Europe we have a textile industry.We must also have a textile industry in Europe in the future, but this will only be the case if we can use the technologies of the information and knowledge society there.It is noteworthy that it is currently missing in the sectors of the so -called ""new economy"" eight -hundred thousand specialists for existing jobs, while there are millions of unemployed.This means that we have not yet been able to take advantage of the instrument of the new economy in order to solve the problems of the old economy that will never find a solution within the structure of this old economy.In conclusion, I would like to answer a question that I have been asked, namely whether I speak here in the name of fifteen or fourteen countries.The answer is simple: I speak in the name of fifteen countries.The unreserved participation of Austria in the work of all Union institutions is part of what the Portuguese presidency guarantees.What the Portuguese government - and certainly also many other governments in Europe - does not prevent it from fighting against a single country, but to defend the principles and values.Incidentally, principles and values ​​that existed before such political movements as the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats.I speak of the principles and values ​​of the era of the Enlightenment, which includes confirmation of the primacy of reason.If modern societies have an enemy today, then they are irrational political behaviors.This irrationality can be called political populism, or excessive nationalism, religious fundamentalism, racism or xenophobia.This is a central question: Without the confirmation of these values, there can be economy and employment, but no Europe., Commission.(IT) Mr. President, Prime Minister, allow me some very short comments to conclude this long, but extremely constructive and important pronunciation.First, we don't start at zero.All those who might consider our statements to be exaggerated to understand that we do not start at zero.Europe can rely on the advantages of the common currency, the advantages of the internal market."	de
"And more than that, and that is more prose, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous political initiatives by converting them into new programs that are comprehensive and comprehensive and to benefit our creative industry to the extent that they need now.It proves mobility and opens up access to culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.What I regret is of course the fact that when it comes to carrying out this program, we do not have a means of the extent that our ambitions require this and it would be necessary for implementation.Ms. President, ladies and gentlemen, we arrived at the end of a long way.After the brokerage phase, our institutions can now formally adopt the new ""Culture 2000"" supporting program.This means that we have a well -suited instrument and clearly structured measures with which we will successfully develop the area of ​​culture in the next five years - I am sure.I am happy about this happy ending and I would like to thank you for it.I would like to thank all members of the parliament who have contributed to a good conclusion.I would particularly like to thank the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport and, above all, the rapporteur, Mr. Graça Moura, and the chairman, Mr. Gargani;Likewise, the delegation of the European Parliament, those responsible for the factions as well as the committee committee and its chairman, Mr. Imbeni.Everyone has made constructive, balanced and decisive amounts, which proved to be great help throughout the procedure.I would like to add that the difficult, sometimes very exhausting negotiations have been completed in record time.We now have a supporting program, the first of this kind in the field of culture.This program gives us the opportunity to set new starting points and to promote the culture of global but also more comprehensive and stronger.How she is happy about these positive results, which, despite an center equipment that does not do justice to the goals, will make it possible for us to tackle the future positively, and I would like to take up what the chairman, Mr. Gargani, has just taken up: The Commission has given a statement in connection with the half -time assessment.She explained that, as part of the report to be submitted in accordance with Article 7, the decision to be submitted in accordance with Article 7 of the decision of Parliament and the Council.This includes checking the funds as part of the community's financial preview;If necessary, the report will contain a proposal to change the decision - and all until June 30, 2002. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a formal obligation that is not just on paper.All of this must lead us to strengthen our actions in favor of a community cultural area within which our cultures can develop better with their special characteristics and differences, but can also enrich each other - and the other European citizens can participate in this.The influence of parliament is also thanks to the fact that more smaller projects are intended in the immediate vicinity of the citizens than large, spectacular actions.This has the result that the ""Culture 2000"" program becomes a program of the citizens."	de
Obviously, here we enter a land, in an dark area, in which their honor will tell me that they are civil objectives, such as bridges, railway or road infrastructures, while others will say that they are military objectives, because they support military structures for aggressive actions such as those carried out at that time the forces of Mr. Milosevic in the field of Kosovo.That difference in interpretation of some objectives is what separates us.Unfortunately, during military actions in Kosovo there were also, as everyone recognized, civil sectors, particularly related to infrastructure that directly affected populations, and even populated areas, which were reached in NATO air actions.That is recognized, that happens in all wars and Kosovo's war was not a clean war, it was not an exemplary war: it was the possible war.Only, that it was the necessary war, in addition to possible, to end an absolutely unacceptable and perfectly repudiable aggression by the entire international community.Regardless of the interpretation that we can make afterwards-it is easy to make interpretations afterwards, if it does not act-, I believe, honor, that if we examine what happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the impunity caused by the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its extension, perhaps we can make a slightly less catastrophic interpretation of the military action of NATO in Kosovo.Question Nº 4 Asked by (H-0028/00): Subject: Turkish block against Armenia taking into account that the European Union actively encourages social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the collaboration and cooperation agreement signed on October 12, 1999, what measures do you intend to adopt the council to persuade the Turkish government to lift the economic blockade against Armenia?Has the time come for the Turkish government to raise economic block against Armenia?Mr. President, I want to express my thanks to the representative of the Presidency of the Council for your response.However, I am something sad because it is first look bilaterally although there is a very clear triangular relationship.We give cooperation credits and we have a cooperation agreement to help Armenia and, despite this, the aid cannot be effective because Turkey carries out an economic blockage so that many things destined for Armenians cannot advance.It is negotiated with Türkiye on a possible adhesion and is of interest to all of us that any state that wants to become a member maintains friendly relationships at borders with its neighbors.Can't influence more on Türkiye to make a peaceful evolution possible and that Armenians can also experience development that is necessary for the prosecution of cooperation?Their honor is right in saying that we must take advantage of the relationship with Turkey precisely so that this country plays a constructive role in that situation and, in particular, becomes part of the solution and ceases to be part of the problem.	es
Many protest voters, who have long wanted a change in Austrian policy, have surely mobilized too.I am of the opinion that parliament must support these democratic forces.I also appeal to the Austrian president so that he still examines all the possibilities of forming a government made up of democratic forces.Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to insist on the value of an attitude like that which the president of our group, Mr. Francis Wurtz, recalled recently.I appreciate the declarations of the chairmanship of the Council and the position of the fourteen countries which have refused to establish official contacts with the Austrian government if the party of Jörg Haider participates in it.It is all the more important to emphasize this that, as everyone knows, we depict the political lines defined by this Europe substantially, as economic and social policies, the deficit of democracy, the involvement of these same countries in the dramatic War of the Balkans.This dissenting highlights our approval today: an exceptional element, because the danger of a renaissance in Europe of an irrational and neonazia component is also exceptional.This danger does not only concern Austria, but Europe too.We are talking about ourselves, not Austria.We are aware of the social causes which contribute, with unemployment and uncertainty, to feed such propensions.We know the cultural reasons - xenophobic, racist - but we cannot ignore the inability and the refusal of these far -right forces to cut bridges with Nazism and the possibility of creating an explosive mixture in Europe.Let's talk about the Alpine Arc, let's talk about all our countries: conditions allowing an resurgence of a danger to European democracy and civilization are currently put in place.In its position, the presidency was aware of this drama of civilization.Europe proves that it has not forgotten Auschwitz, Europe has a soul.Today, it should however be substantial in its actions, and the commission should be the first to be.Unfortunately, it has shown here opacity and fragility which even more affirm the value of the position of the presidency.This is the correction to be made to the action of the commission.Madam President, dear colleagues, faced with the fundamental democratic principle of respect for human rights and freedom and sovereignty of peoples against any form, new or old, fascism, Nazism or communism, and since all previous speakers have spoken of sovereignty of the Austrian people, we see today this sovereignty denied by the European Parliament itself.It does not appear from reading the program of the Austrian liberal-democratic party, no element that could justify the accusations of attack on the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law consecrated by article 6 of the treaties.On the contrary, I would like to remind colleagues that the President in office, who is so critical of Austria, recently placed the inhabitants of Macao under the sovereignty of democratic People's Republic of China.	fr
"What else will the union try in this regard in case the requirement of the opposition - early elections?What else can we do and try to support the opposition?Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, we trust that Kosovo has been the last case in which international law could be interpreted as dictators can persecute minorities, in the most cruel way, hiding in that ""it takes place within the borders of the country itself.""When the US, NATO and finally the EU reacted, it was late, too late.Many sufferings could have been avoided if, among others, the US would have reacted before and more clearly.That is why we, the European Union, have a special responsibility to help, help and build the Balkans.Our goal has to be the creation of the necessary conditions so that all countries in southeastern Europe are integrated economically, commercially and politically in the EU.The best way to put the foundations for democracy in this part of Europe whipped by war, is through trade and economic integration.The liberals are willing to go far and do it quickly, as Paolo Costa has pointed out.That is why we celebrate with great satisfaction this proposal of stabilization and association agreement with Macedonia and we thank Swoboda for this excellent report.Macedonia deserves our help, thinking about work, sacrificed and selfless, that his people and his rulers made during the Kosovo War.Now that Macedonia is released from the claws of communism and nationalism, our obligation is to react very clearly and give our support.In the same way we have to act in the other Balkan countries.It is an obligation for the EU.Mr. President, in this context, allow me to remind the deputies - especially in this afternoon's debate - that the man who has the main responsibility for war, outrages, murders and the expulsion of their homes of innocent people, still governs in Serbia, the rest of Yugoslavia.The man who is accused of genocide and who should be tried in the Hague Court is still free.I'm talking about Milosevic.While Milosevic continues to rule Serbia and it does not choose a democratic path, that country will continue to be a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkan region and, also, in Macedonia.Mr. President, the agreement promoted will constitute the first application of the Stability Pact in Southeast Europe.Undoubtedly, its terms, accepted by the Swoboda report, do not pursue peace, but a greater political and economic subordination in the country, the control of its natural wealth, the overexploitation of its workforce, and an even greater use of the country as a basis for attack against the countries and peoples of the region that resist the new order.And all this in exchange for the promise of a future adhesion to the European Union.The report accepts both this orientation and, more in general, the whole policy of the European Union for Southeast Europe."	es
The sanctions can be inflicted after the violation of the treaties and not if a democratically elected party goes to the government.Otherwise, how will we put it with the communist countries, who reaffirm communists: will we also throw out of the union even if they go to the government, or for the grandchildren of Stalin everything will be acquitted?(Applause from the right -down desks) is with diplomacy, persuasion, culture, solidarity, and not with threats, that institutions can be respected and enforced the principles, not with the unconstitutional roads.Bilateral relationships involve states, so the 14 do nothing.This is to trample the European institutions to defend logics of the political part, with an incompetence worthy of parties just out of totalitarian systems and not of representatives of democratic traditions.From Haider they divide many, too many things - as we have repeatedly written - including his claim to the very Italian South Tyrol.But we knew this: today we learn with anguish that other exponents of the Union seem to have renounced the democratic role of the same.We are for the legality and democracy expressed by peoples, for the respect of national sovereignty until the same is the principles of the treatise or the rights of man.We believe in Europe, while others seem to have started the process of disintegration of the union.These are the results of hasty enlargements, lack of clarity of roles and tasks.Europe of the dancer market has been created, not that of principles, rights and politics.Here are the consequences!We can therefore only invite the Commission to continue on a role of moderation and give appreciation to those who work so that the autonomy and sovereignty of the Austrian people continues, making this people remain free and solidarity with other peoples.Lady president, today we meet at the sign of hypocrisy.The Council showed a total contempt of the Treaty and resorted to a procedure completely in contrast with articles 6 and 7 which provide for the possibility of condemning a state in the event of a serious and persistent violation.There are currently no serious and persistent violations in Austria.There are risks, and we are completely aware of it, but there is no serious or persistent violation at all.If we were called to apply the principles contained in articles 6 and 7, if we were to apply Copenhagen's criteria to our institutions, to the European Union, this hypothetical candidate could not become a member for those same criteria that we ask for observance to the countries of Eastern Europe.If we talked about serious and persistent violation, we could certainly talk about some Member States, we could speak of Italy and France, respectively the first and third country to have been sentenced by the Council of Europe and the Court of Strasbourg.We could talk about Belgium, honorable Belgian colleagues, of the Dutroux case, the dozens and dozens of kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by certain characters in this country, whose investigations have been skilled, systematically skilled.	it
In the new agreement, both sides commit a responsible state leadership that is considered a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, and a regular dialogue will take place in an area that the community actively promotes.Second, a new procedure was created to treat violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.Compared to the current approach, the responsibility of the state in question is given a stronger weighting in the new procedure, and the consultation process is more flexible in order to be able to lead an effective dialogue about the measures to improve the situation.In particularly urgent cases in which there is a serious violation of one of these essential elements, measures are immediately initiated, about which the other party is informed.Third, the EU and the AKP have agreed on a new, special procedure for serious corruption cases.This is a real innovation, both in the context of the EU/AKP agreements and generally in international relationships.This procedure is not only used in corruption cases that deal with EEF money, but also in a further framework in all countries in which the EU provides financial support, and in which corruption hinders development.The procedure is therefore not limited to EU activities.This is an extremely important aspect in which the funding of public finances is taken into account.By accepting such a provision in the partnership agreement, the EU and the AKP countries jointly set a clear and positive signal, which will certainly be recognized by the European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors.Another new area in the agreement between the AKP countries and the EU is immigration.We have concluded a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area.This new dimension of the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines for which the EU advocates the contract of Amsterdam and the conclusions of the European Council in Finnish Tampere in October 1999.The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy based on the principle of partnership with the countries of origin and regions.The agreement concluded with the AKP countries prepares the way for new initiatives, especially with regard to the rights of nationals of third countries within the EU, and for measures to facilitate integration.We have agreed on regulations related to illegal immigration.The EU and the AKP countries will be determined within a framework that is to be negotiated with each individual AKP state, the possibilities and instruments for the return of illegal immigrants to the relevant countries.This also includes people from third countries and stateless people.With these extremely innovative approaches, the manner of the government can be improved.The agreement also creates a good framework for stabilizing the mutual reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid.We have agreed to include negotiations on new trade agreements to liberalize trade between the parties and to develop regulations on the regulation of trade issues.With regard to the temporal framework for the trade negotiations, we have taken into account the wishes of the AKP countries.Negotiations are started in 2002 at the latest.This two-year preparation phase is to be used to strengthen the regional integration processes and the ability of the AKP countries to manage trade negotiations.	de
"Stenzel Report (A5-0034/2000) Mr. President, I would like to make a very short declaration of vote on behalf of the group of the European People's Party on the Equal report.We followed a voting procedure exactly corresponding to the agreements previously taken with the socialist group.The socialist group, however, has changed the relationship, making it less clear than it could have been.This fact led us to abstain from the vote.We want the report on the Equal initiative to be approved, also because it is very important both for refugees and the elderly, and for the disabled and women.It is a pity that, due to the procedure followed, very little attention has been paid to the report in this plenary session.I am convinced that the nationality of the rapporteur has had its influence - a type of influence completely out of place in this assembly, since it is in contrast with the European values ​​and certainly with the parliamentary values ​​to which our Parliament recalls so often.These are the considerations that have prompted us to refrain from the vote on the relationship.We want the Equal initiative to go on;We share the great part of this, but we deplore the procedure that has been followed as well as the unworthy way in which it was exploited by some groups of Parliament.Mr. President, also as representative of the Pensioners Party to the European Parliament, I refrained on the vote regarding the Equal initiative because, while introducing to a greater extent than the past the support for projects aimed at fighting discrimination based on age, it was not quite incisive and concrete in this direction.I also abstained for another reason: I believe that the time has come for the institutions of the European Union to cease the experimentation and the search for good practices regarding what we have to do and begin to give concrete indications to European citizens on what Europe wants Europe.We must take concrete measures and go from theory to practice..We voted in favor of the Commission's communication report that establishes the guidelines relating to Community initiative programs (PIC).We are basically contrary to this type of programs and structural funds, but since the vote concerns only the how - and not the measure in which - these resources must be used, we followed this.We believe that the guarantee of equal opportunities for the groups mentioned in the report is important.We did not vote against the relationship as we believe that some right general principles, such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce the inequalities based on sex on the labor market.However, we have not voted even in favor because these intentions remain very vague, if not even at the unrealistic level.In the chapter relating to the help and training projects in favor of refugees, the report instead takes a step back compared to the initial text, since it takes care to clarify that refugees are no longer interested as such, but the ""refugees only in accordance with the Geneva Convention"".Such restriction is inadmissible at a time when in all of Europe numerous refugees are found in a dramatic situation, without protection, forced to work in clandestinity and to hide, while the governments and the police forces of states that are said to be democratic give them hunting."	it
"It simply authorizes the commission to do so if it wishes.As has already been said, the council decision proposal is divided into two parts.The first concerns the financing of Member States to apply community programs.The second part is to authorize the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects.There are a few minor amendments: Amendment 2 aims to guarantee that the financial contribution in favor of the Member States can cover not only the data collection costs but also the costs of management, compilation, aggregation, etc.Amendments 3 and 6 are intended to soften the calendar since the Member States will have to wait for the implementation of the application regulations to find out what programs really involve; they also aim to align the calendar with dates and regulations.Amendments 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is regularly transmitted to the budgetary authorities.More significantly, the Fisheries Commission, within the framework of amendment 1, accepts the recommendation of the budget commission according to which the financing should be entered in post 1 (b) rather than at post 3 of the financial prospects.Although in its preliminary draft budget, the Commission has registered credits in post 3 ""internal policies"", the Parliament has created a new B1-500 budget line to finance the measures during discussion.This provides security, to ensure that the necessary resources continue to be available.Mr. President, I think we all have to agree with the assertion of Ms. Attwooll at the start of her excellent report according to which these two proposals from the Commission, aimed at better understanding the scientific and socio-economic situation in the fishing sector, arrive at a critical moment.The exhaustive collection of the data that is proposed and their appropriate processing will be essential elements to discuss with more rigor the revision of the common fishing policy.This - obviously - if the data is ultimately obtained.Because, as our rapporteur also rightly points out, the Commission's proposal has no compulsory nature for the Member States.The sending or not of the data is completely voluntary, and their non -presentation would only mean the loss of a certain economic compensation, which, moreover, is not very high either.Given our experience in terms of data presentation in the fishing sector - and I get back to reports on the implementation of pop - I think that instead of having a complete table of the situation in this sector, we will end up with a confused panorama, in which Member States will provide, for example, scientific data, but not those relating to employment, while others will communicate those on employment, but not to -get them and transmit them.And, of course, I am afraid that some prefer to give up financing, if it allows them to continue to hide their mismanagement, to which we have already attended in cases where the sending of said data was compulsory, as in the case of pop."	fr
"Regarding the calendar and objectives, the Council provides that the objective of achieving a good state of surface waters be carried out no later than 16 years after the entry into force of the Directive, the Environmental, Public Health and Consumer Protection Commission wishes that this period is reduced to 10 years.The Commission also asks for any discharge or loss of hazardous substances by 2020. The final objective must consist of reaching close values ​​of zero by 2020. The Council hopes to reach a good state of groundwater after a period of 16 years, but the commission intends to put an end to the deterioration of the qualitative chemical state of groundwater to reach the level of good state of groundwater within 10 years.All standards and all objectives related to protected areas must be carried out before 10 years and not within 16 years.I must say that I am in favor of these reductions in deadlines, with greater reason when repealed ones have been foreseen.Regarding the costs, I approve the proposal that here to 2010, Member States will have to ensure that water pricing policies encourage a more reasonable use of water resources.In the same sense, I hope that the European Commission will make a clear statement with which it undertakes to present a proposal to ensure that the prices of water use reflect environmental costs and costs in terms of resources for 2012. I will end up citing one of the amendments of the Environmental, Public Health and Consumer Protection Commission that does not need any comments: ""Water is not a commercial good like the others, but a heritage that belongs to the people.European and to protect, defend and treat as such. "".(En) I want to officially record my concern about the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote.We have all agreed on the need to establish adequate controls for the protection of our water supply and also for water users.Much of what the rapporteur says about the water problem is worthy of praise.However, the issue of rights or taxes for water use is an issue that, by virtue of subsidiarity norms, are the member states that have to decide.In my opinion it is not appropriate to use a medium as rough as the imposition of a common European burden on this issue.In Ireland all the main water users, who are trade, industry and agriculture, already pay water use.This is a decision of the national and local government, and at that level it is where all future decisions must be being.Those are the main reasons for my vote..(En) The European Union is currently in the process of adopting a new water legislation in the European Union with a view to updating and establishing a long -term strategy to achieve a clean drinking water supply and the protection of current water resources, rivers and coastal waters included.I support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy, but I do not support the proposal that domestic waters have to pay rights for the water used."	es
It is true that his democratic life is still very imperfect, as demonstrated by challenge and doubts regarding the results of the latest presidential elections.But, in this tragic situation for their people, we cannot leave without an effective and adequate response the call of the leaders of the Government and the opposition of Mozambique, who have managed to resist with sense of responsibility the temptation to return to violence as a way to solve their problems.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Lordship, I want to add my voice to those of all those who have already intervened here, in the sense of pointing to the attention of this assembly - it is not necessary, but the brutal tragedy that is happening in Mozambique must be done.I have some figures here and I think they are the most up -to -date;There are already more than three hundred dead, six hundred and fifty thousand people displaced, two million four hundred thousand people isolated, eighty -five thousand people who need to be evacuated: some are above the trees, others on top of roofs.As has been said, the most important thing is helicopters, the most important thing is that this humanitarian aid is not late, because, if not, in addition to the tragedy created by floods, there will be a subsequent tragedy: the lack of assistance to the population that will die of hunger, diseases and floods.And that is really tragic and a conscientious position for all of us.The commissioner has recently said that he was effectively linked to Mozambique, as I am too, and, therefore, he understands well what is at stake, all the tragic situation that is being experienced.I hope that from the trip of Commissioner Nielsen and the Portuguese Secretary of State, the information that this Parliament needs to know what is at stake, the very urgent needs that exist so that we can help the people of that country, which well deserves it, in their struggle for development.Let me thank Mr. Commissioner Patten to go to Parliament, despite having been notified in so little in advance, in response to our desires to discuss this matter as serious and, as already said, the images we have seen on television of the Asolate Valle del Limpopo are absolutely shocking.There are children who have lost their parents and families stripped, desperate and helpless who have lost absolutely everything.Although, as already said, all this tragedy had been predicted and was predictable, and the slow and inadequate response, deplobly and deeply inadequate, is something that it should now force us to really and with all seriousness in catastrophes prevention measures.As the commissioner has said, it is one more argument in favor of the creation of a rapid response unit for situations like this, which is responsible for dealing with crisis such as the one in that country and that has been aggravated by the fact of not having strategies or logistics preparations in situ.	es
"As I had the opportunity to say, the Commission is aware of its share of responsibility.In this context, it brings a final touch to a first draft proposal for an evaluation panel, a scoreboard, so that all the institutions and the other parties concerned can evaluate the progress made in the implementation of the necessary measures and in compliance with the deadlines set by the Amsterdam Treaty, the Vienna Action Plan and the conclusions of the Tampere European Council.This evaluation panel will not be a simple legislative programming instrument, but also and above all an instrument for strengthening transparency and responsibility for all European institutions to citizens.Because it is for citizens that we set up the space of freedom, security and justice.The progress recorded will be due not to the Commission, the Council or even to the European Parliament, but rather to the Association of European institutions and to the Member States themselves, insofar as, as has been said here, determined tasks of the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity.In the coming weeks, I will carry out a tour of the capitals in order to probe the opinion of the Ministers of Justice and Interior Affairs.I intend to debate this scoreboard project with the European Parliament and civil society.We intend to present the final version to the ""Justice and Internal Affairs"" council, under the Portuguese presidency, after the consultations that I have just mentioned.My intention is to make this scoreboard a political and strategic orientation instrument for all institutions, but also an examination of examination on the part of public opinion.I therefore recognize - and this is a challenge to which we are all faced with - the need to develop a communication strategy that allows the general public to perceive what is the effective added value of the Union in everyday life, in these areas so essential to citizenship, respect for legality and, basically, of democracy itself.Beyond the scoreboard, I would like to say that the Commission intends to present the following initiatives, during the year 2000, and I would like to emphasize here that I welcome that the Portuguese presidency considers the development of this space as one of the priorities of its work program.I hope it will be possible, with the Portuguese presidency, to work clearly in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, which also constitutes the political message of Tampere, and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be followed by the subsequent presidencies.With regard to immigration and the right of asylum, the Commission intends to present proposals for the development of a community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees;Start the analysis of the criteria and conditions for improving the implementation of the Dublin Convention and the possible amendment of its legal basis, in accordance with the Amsterdam Treaty;Continue the debate from the communication already carried out on the rules leading to a process of asylum common to the whole Union;And present proposals for the development of legislation providing for the granting of residence permits for victims of the trafficking in human beings who cooperate with justice against trafficking networks."	fr
Mr President, I would like to say the following about the explanations of the Council and the European Commission: I see how sensitive you, Mr. President, approach this topic and what efforts to contact the Turkish-Cypric side.Perhaps it would be clearer and correct, even if the vocabulary used by them would not be doubted that they in no way have an - however given - indirect recognition in mind, even if they emphasized that this would not be possible under any circumstances.For example, I would not speak of the government in Nicosia.This is the Cypriot government, Mr. President, not the government in Nicosia.This government has proposed a mode of how the Turkish-Cypric side can be involved.The Council and the Commission should now urge the Turkish-Cypric side of being institutionally integrated into the framework of the negotiations that are undertaken by the Republic of Cyprus.On the other hand, the way in which the question of leaving the protocols and the approach strategy has so far aroused some doubts.I cannot understand why an exception should be made for these two small countries, why there are conflicts between the organs or why the parliament had to exert pressure so that the funds are transferred to Chapter 7 for the approach strategy.Is it really possible that the European Union treats two small countries on the edge of the Union in such a way that it needs on the one hand, but on the other hand, which on the other hand also bring all the prerequisites to become full-fledged members of the EU and which could actually already join the Economic and Monetary Union?I agree with the commissioner that this is a political decision, a political decision that should not be too difficult, Mr. President, if one considerations consider the enormous advantages, but above all the support so that the two community forms a state again so that there is a substantial extension - there has already been a first approach between the two communities - and finally frees the republicbecomes.President, venerated colleagues, as part of the hearing procedure, we today deal with a proposal for a regulation of the Council on the implementation of measures regarding the approach strategy for Cyprus and Malta.This proposal is comparable to the one that has already been submitted to other accession countries, and after its implementation, he will replace the recently expired financial protocol.The instruments for introducing are intended to represent a technical and financial contribution to the efforts of the accession countries to meet the requirements of the Acquis Communautaire.The review by the Commission has shown that Cyprus and Malta - although these countries are counted by the World Bank to the states with high incomes - encounter the same difficulties in the implementation of community law as the Moel, due to their insufficient capacity of the administrations and courts.On the occasion of the examination of Mr. Brok's excellent report in the committee, it was pointed out that these two countries can also enjoy the Meda household line for horizontal measures for horizontal measures.I ask the Commissioner for express confirmation of this point.	de
Environmental institutions often lack knowledge and methods to incorporate this perspective in their daily work.I would obviously know if the curator is willing to integrate the perspective of equal opportunities for men and women in environmental policy and in environmental programs.This is important.For all policy to acquire this perspective, I think it is especially important that bosses, in positions of responsibility, possess this elementary knowledge..(SV) Obviously my idea is that mainstreaming must be present in everything we do.In the plan that is being prepared in my general direction, issues on equal opportunities for men and women have a very prominent role.I am also willing, for example, to personally organize seminars on leadership or other matters to encourage women to assume new tasks within the commission.To motivate them all, I think it is very important that this message be sent from top to bottom, or from the bottom up if so preferred.In general, my idea is that in environmental work there is a female majority.It is about this settling, so that women can also access positions of responsibility or reach higher positions in environmental work.I want to affirm that our action plan reflects these ideas, but it can surely be improved.I have some experience in the elaboration and evaluation of plans.I hope it helps me something.QUESTION Nº 43 Asked by (H-0045/00): Subject: The Boyne estuary and the DrugHheda Port Company Society The Boyne estuary is listed as a special protection zone under the directive of the directive related to the conservation of wild birds and is pending designation as a special conservation zone under the protection of the directive related to the protection of natural habitatsinternational.However, the Ministry of the Navy, the Lough County Council and the Local Corporation of Drughetda have authorized the development of a new port in the special protection zone and the desiccation, in Stegrennan, of a Barrizal that was recently added in the area of ​​protection to express instances of the Commission.In addition, a very large warehouse ship has been built there (without being easy to access the documentation related to the corresponding works permit) and the Droogheda Corporation projects other infrastructure works.How can the commission guarantee that this kind of development, financed by structural funds, does not clash with the environmental conservation needs?Is the commission ready to completely suspend financing as long as the area's development plans are not reviewed?The Commission has knowledge of the construction of the port, but knows nothing about the warehouse ship or the other infrastructure works mentioned by the deputy.The construction of the port is financed from the structural funds and means, in broad strokes, that the Boyne estuary must be dredging and that the material obtained will be provisionally stored in the coastal strip of Stegrennan.The Boyne river estuary is listed as a special protection zone under the directive related to wild bird conservation.This means that all works in the Boyne estuary that may affect the special conservation zone must respect the conservation standards established in the directive related to the protection of natural habitats.	es
More particularly, the Commission can completely accept amendments 6, 16, 21, 28, 31, 33, 34, 44, 45, 46, 48, 52, 53, 65, 67, 68, 75, 76, 78, 80, 84, 88 and 102. The Commission can partly accept the amendments 8, 18, 27, 29, 43, 43,94, 104 and 105. The Commission can in principle accept amendments 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 30, 32, 35, 36, 38, 50, 55, 57, 58, 63, 73, 79, 86, 96, 106 and 108.1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 87, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 81 (rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107. Thank you.(The President declares the common position approved as modified) Report (A5-0033/2000) of Mr. Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication of the Commission relating to a concerted strategy to modernize social protection (COM (1999) 347) - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182 (COS)) (Parliament adopts the resolution)This concludes the vote.Explanations to vote- Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000) I salute the quality and the ambition of this report relating to Life.I will briefly remind you that Life is a financial instrument at the service of environmental policies within the European Union as in third countries, that it acts from neighboring Mediterranean countries, the Baltic Sea countries or countries candidates for membership.The Commission of Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has proposed many amendments which, for the most part, have been retained in the common position adopted by the Council.For the third stage of Life (2000-2004), this instrument will be divided into three axes entitled Life-Nature (47 %of resources), Life-Environnement (47 %) and Life-Pays Third (6 %).In my opinion, the most important changes focus on: Life's contribution to sustainable development in the community, as well as to the development of community policy in the field of the environment, in particular with regard to the integration of the environment into other policies, and to update as well as to update the environmental legislation;Improving efficiency, transparency and methodology of Life implementation procedures, information and dissemination procedures with the public and cooperation procedures between beneficiaries;Life's objective: this must mainly aim for sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the Urban initiative, on which I had the opportunity to express myself elsewhere;The contribution of projects supported to the sustainability of socio-economic activities, and therefore to the creation of jobs.What seems essential to me is that the Life instrument will remain open to the participation of the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe.The other candidate countries (ex: Cyprus, Türkiye, Malta) will also be able to participate in Life when agreements allowing this participation will be concluded with these countries.	fr
We have submitted a communication on joint asylum procedures and a decision -making recommendation authorizing the Commission to negotiate with Iceland and Norway an agreement intended to extend to these two countries the rules applied to the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention.The Commission actively contributed to the work of the high -level group on immigration and the right of asylum.Finally, in December, the Commission presented a proposal for the creation of the European Refugees Fund.In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for settlement with a view to the communitarization of certain agreements: one on judicial cooperation and the execution of decisions in civil and commercial matters, (Brussels I);Another relating to the competence, recognition and execution of decisions in matrimonial matters (Brussels II) and yet another concerning the summons and notification of judicial and extrajudicial acts in civil and commercial matters.We presented, still in 1999, a communication on the victims of crime in the Union, by starting a reflection born of Tampere and by demanding the development of minimum standards on the protection of victims of crime, especially on their access to justice and their rights to the compensation for the prejudices suffered, including legal costs.I will also mention the presentation of the decision -making project on the fight against fraud and falsification of means of payment other than species.In the field of the Union's legislative framework, with regard to the fight against financial crime, the Commission presented a project to revise the money laundering directive.In 1999, we attended the entry into office of Europol.After what was asserted here by the Portuguese presidency, with the new cycle in the fields of justice and internal affairs, the start of the reflection relating to the implementation of the new skills attributed to Europol by the Treaty of Amsterdam, we sincerely hope that it will be possible to discuss in the same way with the Commission with regard to the question of democratic control and the articulation between Europol and the relevant judicial instances.In 1999, the Commission presented its contribution to a European action plan in the fight against drugs, which is the basis of the strategy adopted by the Helsinki European Council.This list of non -exhaustive actions allows me to reaffirm today before the presidency of the Council and the deputies, with great conviction, that if 1999 was the year of the consolidation of the action of the Union in this fundamental field, it will also have been the beginning of a new phase of acceleration of the creation of a space of freedom, security and justice.The year 2000 will undoubtedly be the year of truth for the European institutions and the way in which they will be able to meet the requirements of citizens in terms of guarantee of freedom of movement, in compliance with rights and the guarantee of security and stability, thanks to adequate judicial protection.This amounts to saying that the year 2000 will be for the Council, the Parliament and the Commission, a test year of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to contribute to the foundations of an extended political union for the next decade.	fr
The packaging continues to represent a huge mess in Europe and entail a load for the environment.A sector of the Socialists, headed by Bernd Lange, affirms that yes, that the principle is good, but that we should not introduce it until 2010 or 2012, as reflected in the amendment 45. The common position establishes the year 2006. This is, in the opinion of the Green Group, more than enough time for the automobile industry to prepare for the change.Therefore, I ask my colleagues not to support the amendment 38 of the democraticristians and nor the amendment 45 of a group of socialist deputies.When vehicle manufacturers must run themselves with the costs of recycling vehicles then they will design them so that it is easier and cheaper to reuse them.For example, problematic plastics, the PVC, will disappear from cars and will be replaced by biological plastics manufactured from plants.They will ultimately be cheaper, also for consumers.20 years ago, most of Parliament tried to get the European environment more ecological.Today, this environmental position is in danger, subject to the pressure, above all, of the French and German car industry.Therefore, deputies, let's vote against amendments 38 and 45. As a group of greens, we roughly support the common position.Mr. President, the remains of vehicles at the end of their useful life constitute one of the great environmental problems, both for the amount of spills and scrap and for substances harmful to the environment.For this reason, the GUE/NGL group advocates the implementation of norms, as broad and consistent as possible.This directive allows us to move forward, but provided that Parliament does not destroy or weaken the position of the Council.If they were approved, many of the amendments presented would considerably weaken this directive.I especially refer to the amendments of the PPE group, but, unfortunately, also to some amendments of Mr. Lange, according to my understanding.It is not difficult to imagine that the automobile industry of some countries, for example the German, has worked intensely, through pressure groups, about the approval of this directive.For us, it is decisive that the following points are considered: the one that contaminates, pays.This implies that the producer must assume his responsibility, even in economic terms, for the recycling of vehicles.You also have to have rules for cars that already exist.In this matter, we cannot accept that the position of the Council is weakened on the date of entry into force.The percentages and demands of recycling in certain years should not be worse.It is also important to limit the use of hazardous elements such as lead.We will vote against all amendments that oppose this.It would be very negative, not only from the environmental point of view but also for the credibility of the European Parliament in environmental issues, which the amendments that considerably weaken the directive are approved.	es
This paper is a farce!A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what is specified here in paper form so that in blatant contradiction is what is actually.Such a paper is not a basis for a scoreboard at all.It was advertised and celebrated as the great achievement, but I stand by needing a basis for a scoreboard.We as a parliament want to deal seriously on the basis of a program with future development in this policy area.What we expect are minimum standards in the asylum procedures to get a quick help for refugees, but also to create clarity for those who are not on the run.We want instruments for avoiding abuse.We want to develop a community immigration policy, which of course also includes the ability to integrate the Member States, and we need the expansion of the operational tasks of Europol, for example, in order to take a very concrete measures against combating organized crime.We deal with these tasks seriously and very intensively, and we can also expect this from the Commission, even if it is only about the submission of papers!Ms. President, Mr Commission President, Dear Commissioner, dear colleagues!I take the word to address the topic of world trade organization, an area in which there is no matches between the papers of the Commission and the positions of the parliamentary group of the Social Democratic Party of Europe, which, as already mentioned, is not the case in other sectors.There is an agreement of the views because we are for the worldwide trade exchange.We are for this exchange, but above all for the creation of common regulations, common regulations with which this world trade can be regulated on a goal: This trade should serve the development and in particular a harmonious development, in which the values ​​of citizens not only belong to the most dynamic and competitive regions in the world.On the other hand, what do we find with this remark about the principles?That this regulation and these norms at the level of the world trade organization for a greater trade exchange, i.e.h.have led to greater wealth.However, if we look at the indices of the distribution of this wealth, we unfortunately recognize that the gap between the richest blocks and countries in the world and the poorest and the least developed countries is still becoming ever deeper.Therefore, it would be legitimate and imperative that we ask ourselves what use the current common norms, the current common regulations.What value do the current negotiations, as they take place, and the current way of working of the world trade organization, if this increases the exchange of trade, but on the other hand, dysfunctions are caused and this gap between the rich and poor countries is growing further?That is why we said that we support the strategy here by the Commission for the Negotiations in Seattle and for upcoming discussions.Above all, we are for this strategic vision, but courage and boldness are required.On the one hand, for the impending negotiations on the inclusion of social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection must be imposed.	de
With this, your concerns, Ms. Peijs, should be at least a little scattered.(En) As for Mr. Evans's reference to the effects on the economy, a corresponding cost-benefit analysis should really be taken seriously.Finally, the publication of the white book serves to record reactions from companies and other sources.We have received numerous excellent information and information that offers us sufficient material for a cost-benefit rating for the economy.Before we submit a legislative proposal for a new regulation, we will very carefully check the entire material.As far as the effects on companies are concerned, one thing is particularly important that was addressed by Ms. Thyssen, Ms. Peijs and Mrs. Palacio Vallelersundi, and that affects the SME.This was underlined by many of my previous speakers.The legal certainty of the SME is particularly important to the Commission.We propose a system that significantly increases legal certainty for SMEs.How come?Is it just a political gesture?No.We propose to reform the material-legal regulations in such a way that most SMEs fall under the group exemption, similar to the vertical restrictions on competition.Most SMEs have only one market share of less than 30 %anyway.We have a de-minimis notification with the determination that SMEs usually do not fall under the strict prohibition in accordance with Article 81 (1), since they do not take a dominant position.We work on other group exemptions and guidelines that take the special position of SMEs into account.Our white book about the modernization will also improve the location of the SMEs, firstly by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the current registration system and secondly by introducing the direct applicability of Article 81 (3), which should be particularly advantageous for SME.(It) Fourthly legal certainty: Legal certainty, Mr. Evans, is undoubtedly - and I am the first to recognize this - important to the companies and not only for the legal professions, which nevertheless fulfill an extremely important role in the European structure.Legal certainty is important for the companies: The importance of this topic was also given by the chairman of the committee for law and internal market, Ms. Palacio Vallelersundi - which I would like to thank that, as always, in a wide sense, in the present case, in relation to the competition - they underlined in their last explanations.In my conviction, the present proposal will mean greater legal certainty for companies, for three reasons: Due to the direct effect of Article 81 (3), it will enable the approval of all competitive agreements that meet the exceptional conditions.He will create the possibility of helping companies in the event of doubts in the interpretation of the publication of justified statements;At the same time, this determines exemptions and guidelines to clarify the rules and to ensure their security.(Fr) Ms. Thyssen also addressed the question of legal exception for Justitarians.I just want to remind you that the Court of Justice, as you certainly know better than I do, made a decision on this question in 1982.This case law is still valid and there is no reason to question it.	de
The free recovery system, for example, of old vehicles and the increase in the percentage to recycle will increase as much the recycling activities and the number of jobs it generates.So, for the consumer, for the environment, for the new jobs to be created in recycling, it is absolutely not necessary to amend the common position of the council which is, in the current state, completely acceptable.Mr. President, like many others in this enclosure, I think it's a good measure.It is a useful measure that we all need.Most technical questions have been resolved.Some details must still be settled, but most technical questions have been resolved.We come to the final question.During the first reading, only the economic and monetary commission asked this question and I was the only one, as a rapporteur for the opinion of this commission, to ask the question in Parliament, that simply pays?Thanks to the common position of the council, a reasonable compromise has been reached, in the sense that the manufacturers should pay a significant share of the costs and not all, as Mr. Bowis said in an erroneous manner.In fact - and it is the lawyers who tell us - they should not pay more than 20 % or a fifth of the costs, which is not unreasonable.For example, consider consumers to the United Kingdom who buy a rover, as said Mr. Lange, or, in this case, any other British car brand and who, for years, pay an excessive price for these cars, higher than the price in other parts of Europe, why should they pay?They have already paid.Why should taxpayers or future car buyers pay again to get rid of the vehicle thanks to which the manufacturer has made profits?I cannot accept it.Some amendments offer it.I cannot accept it and I will vote against.Regarding these cars, the responsibility is the responsibility of the manufacturer.It is the manufacturer who must provide the infrastructure and assume a reasonable part of the elimination cost.The common position does not exclude the possibility of contributions made by the government.The common position constitutes a reasonable compromise.Certain amendments offered today are completely unreasonable in the sense that they unload the car manufacturers of the responsibility to pay even a small part of the cost of eliminating cars on the road.I cannot accept it and on behalf of the taxpayers and consumers of Europe, I vote against these amendments.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone agrees to say that we must think about how to treat vehicles out of use in Europe, but, in this case, the Council has not given an example of a judicious European environmental policy.The way in which the German presidency of the Council dealt with this theme was blameless.First, Mr. Trittin, the Minister of the Environment, did not conduct sufficient consultation within his cabinet;Then, the Federal Chancellor, Mr. Schröder, immersed himself in this procedure, like an elephant in a porcelain store, without knowing the file.	fr
"The seventh category must be provided with funds, where a review of financial perspectives must be carried out.This is the capital point.The most important thing is that the money of prior help to the incorporation for Cyprus and Malta is collected from category seven and a review of financial perspectives is carried out, because if the Council does not support it, it would actually be colliding with the decisions it adopted in Helsinki in December.With regard to the amount indicated in the Brok report, 130 million euros, I also want to say in the name of the liberal group that we have to find an amount that we can negotiate until we reach the amount of the sum.The most important thing is that a multiannual program and in the correct category are guaranteed, so that we can start planning in Chipre and Malta.Mr. President, the European Verdes/Free Alliance Group supports the decision taken by the European Council of Helsinki, according to which the solution to the conflict cannot be a previous condition for the adhesion of Cyprus.A strong pressure on the Government of Chipre must continue to be exerted, although the will of the majority of the population cannot be the object of a Blackmail, a blackmail of a part of it, also because we warm serious doubts about the representativeness of the government of that part of the island.It is evident that the window of opportunities - the ""Janela de Opportunities"", mentioned by the Presidency - must be used to the fullest.However, we are convinced that, although Turkish-shouting relationships have improved, this cannot be enough.The solution to the Cyprus conflict goes first and foremost due to the improvement of relations between the two communities with a view to the Constitution - let's wait not too far - of a federation.In particular, we must act in order to solve the question of establishing true freedom of circulation and the problem of demilitarization and disarmament of the island.The European Union, beyond financial aid, undoubtedly, must play an active role of guarantor and promoter of contacts between both communities establishing debate forums and confidential Building programs.I want to state that at this moment the absence within the Parliament of Alex Langer who was a peace builder and an example for all of us of how coexistence between the peoples is built.Mr. President, the mention of the dialogue between the two chipriota parts with the United Nations Aegis reminds us that, twenty -six years after the invasion of the island by the Turkish Army, the occupation of almost 40% of the territory with 35,000 soldiers, heavy military media and the installation of more than 50,000 settlers, in total violation of the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council continues, continues.What can the European Union do in this framework with a view to favoring - without interference in issues that operate exclusively to the chipriotas - the search for a fair and viable solution for that dramatic problem that affects a country linked to the European Community for almost thirty years and intended to integrate into the Union in the coming years?"	es
And, if we talk about serious and persistent violations, perhaps we can talk about certain member states, we can talk about Italy and France, first and third country, respectively, convicted by the Council of Europe, by the Strasbourg Court.We can speak, Belgian ladies, from Belgium, of the Dutroux case, of the dozens and dozens of children ineshed, tortured, raped, killed by personalities of that country and whose investigations are running, always embroidered.We could, lordships, impose on the Council and the Commission, with a third of the deputies, the obligation to question in that regard.We could interrogate ourselves for the fact that the Austrians reject ten years, thirteen years, of partitocracy that has corrupted and rotten a country -Austria-, as it is corrupted and rot countries such as Italy, Belgium and other member countries of the Union.We could, in truth, ask ourselves, ladies, why 76% of Belgian citizens do not have the least confidence in their country's justice, 56% of French citizens do not have the least confidence in the justice of their country, 53% of Italian citizens do not have the least confidence in their justice ... (the president withdraws the use of the word to the speaker) Mrs. President, my group, the EddConcern for this debate.We cannot support, and we do not do it in any way, the feelings or the policy of Mr. Haider and deplore the references he has made to the third Reich.However, we also deplore the fact that its Parliament raises the possibility of interfering with the policy of a elected government of any country, especially of a country that is part of the European Union.My party in my country is not at all racist, but we do not accept the dictation or interference of the European Union.Do you plan to interfere with the Parliament of Great Britain if we are chosen?Mrs. President, the population of Austria has spoken by choosing Herr Haider to her Parliament.I think it granted 28% of the votes, so a coalition government will be constituted.Your Parliament, allow me to suggest you, Mrs. President, should wait to see if Mr. Haider's party has repercussions on the policy of that country.Then, and only then, I could study if human rights are affected.His parliament can study appropriate measures to counteract that situation and then, Mrs. President, and only then could her parliament consider the possibility of interfering with the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union.Mrs. President, as deputy of the Liberal Party, respect the concerns of some and some colleagues for democratic evolution in Austria.They may be surprised by my reaction if I say that I fully understand the special sensitivity against Austria in issues related to respect for human rights, the consciousness of responsibility regarding their own past and the stability of democracy.Austria has to answer herself with frequently doubtful image that reigns abroad, justified or unjustifiably.	es
"On the basis of these assessments, we want to express our firm opposition to the ""modernization"" of the social protection promoted by the Commission in its communication, concluding that we cannot give our assent to the report presented by the Commission for employment and social affairs.With this, the voting declarations are concluded.(The session, suspended at 13.55, resumes at 15.00) next ""Human Rights"" session of the UN (continuation) The agenda bears the Declaration of the Council on the Union priorities for the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission (March 20, 2000), including the situation in China.Mr. President, deplo the absence of the presidency in office for the Council;It is a declaration of the Council, and it would perhaps have been useful that one of his representatives was present at the continuation of the discussion.It does not seem to me to remember that the need, expressed by all the political groups, which, before the next meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, the Parliament organized a discussion to make its voice on a topic that believes of fundamental importance.I believe that, after the declaration of the Presidency in office of the Council, we all agree that the current situation, as regards human rights, is very far from how we would like it to be.At the level of the Union we must say that the situation is not very satisfactory, since, for example, although the agreement for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms constitutes an element common to all Member States, the subsequent protocols have not been ratified or signed by everyone.In addition, it constitutes a clear inconvenience in this regard the fact that the European Union as such is not a signatory of the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, with all the consequences that this situation entails.I hope these problems can be addressed and discussed in the context of the debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.On an external level, I believe that most of the points inserted in the resolution provides us with a vision closely close to reality and does not invite at all to optimism, Mr. President, considering that aspects such as the abolition of the capital punishment, the torture still practiced in many countries that democratic or the situation of minorities in many areas of the planet require a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union.In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would focus on one in particular: the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations.Mr. President, in a world like the current one, dominated every day by the phenomenon of globalization, and not only in the economic field, we must give concerted and coordinated responses so that they can be effective.To ensure this effectiveness to our actions, it is necessary to implement coordination in practice that does not currently exist.For this reason, Parliament defends the principle of the need to participate in the activity of the human rights Commission and other international institutions that deal with these topics.In addition, Mr. President in office for the Council, the Parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible."	it
Mrs. President!The evaluation of the reform process was certainly very high, which can also be recognized, maybe a little with advance.My question: The reform is necessary not least through the accession of new countries and thus by expanding the Union.How can we - Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the accession states - also deal with this challenge even more effectively, taking into account the ideas that consideration of the accession states?The delegations do an active work - I do it in my delegation for the Czech Republic - but it can be noted that we often have a very senior teacher interaction with each other.What can the reform help to make the relationship and cooperation, the common work between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission more effective?I would like to thank the Lord for the emphasis on the fact that the reform, apart from the fact that it would be useful alone, by the accession process, the extensions is required, especially those extensions that the Union will go through shortly.It is important that we not only carry out this reform for the sake of the current union, but also to enable the accession.In the coming years I will maintain the custom that I have naturally introduced together with many of my commission colleagues to have detailed discussions with the governments of the future Member States.We do this because we want to explain the system to which you will join you in every respect.Likewise, I would also like to point out the enrichment through the further training, which is carried out in general by the Member States and the Union, so that when the new employees add to the Commission and the officials and administrative employees in the member states with the realities, the difficult realities of membership in the Union and in the domestic market, the breaking points will hardly be identified.I would like to experience such a high level of development and such a level of preparation.All I can do now is to make the promise to strive for this.First of all, I would like to wish the Lord's all the best for St. David 's Day.Thank you for your lecture.For the Commission, it is now important not to lose sight of the fact that the reform process would be a full waste of time without restoring the connection to the European public.Above all, this must never be lost sight of.The Commission must serve the public, and the recommendations for reducing payment delays are certainly highly welcome, but another great allegation of the people we represent applies to the paper war.Is there - without drawbacks in financial control - the intention of restricting bureaucracy and the paper war for applicants for European funding?This is constantly complained and there is a need for action.My second question concerns the committee for auditing.Of course, I very much welcome this, but it is also important to indicate a hint to monitor the recommendations that we pronounce from the European Parliament as part of our relief procedure.Will you include this in the work of your committee?In conclusion, I would like to say that the parliamentary group of the Social Democratic Party agrees to the measures -related budgeting and the transfer of responsibility.As Mr. Prodi put it, they will be measured on their actions and not in their words.	de
"In contrast, the 1995 Convention enables the opening of secondary procedures.In this way, exceptional situations are created for the general regulation that the Commission would like to see.After the contract of Amsterdam came into force, the Commission would have preferred to accept a new text in which the thesis of uniformity is expressly anchored.Nevertheless, in my opinion it is now not the time to question the agreement that was achieved in connection with the 1995 Convention - which was negotiated in a period of about thirty years.As a result, the Commission refused to submit a proposal and was limited to the questions of institutional nature.For this reason, the Commission also believes that it does not apply for a change to change the regulation, but would like to explain their view of the changes on the table.The Commission therefore agrees with the amendment applications proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner, Mrs No. 1, 2, 3 and 5, but not to change application No. 4. The Commission is of the opinion that the parliament should rather support the amendment no.4 of the Committee on Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Internal Affairs, so that the Commission can be changed to the regulation, andSupported by a regulatory committee in accordance with Article 5 of the decision EG 1999/468.As a result, the committee agrees with the amendments No. 3 and 4 submitted by the committee for freedoms and rights of citizens, judiciary and internal matters, but not the amendments No. 1 and 2 on the term ""center of the main interests of the debtor"".The center of the main interests of a society or a legal person is sufficiently defined in Article 3 as a term.For all other cases that are not treated directly, the reference in the Recording reason 13 should be regarded as sufficient.Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.(The session is closed at 00.05.) Shipwreck of the Erika According to the agenda, the pronunciation of Mr. Varela Suanzes-Carpegna follows the oral request (B5-0011/2000) on behalf of the fishing committee to the Erika Commission.Mr. President, Commissioner, Ladies and Members!First of all, I would like to point out the appreciation that Mr. Fischler brings us towards with his present presence.Yesterday our President announced that he would be absent for schedule.I think he has covered it again and did what you get used to: he has shown this parliament of his appreciation and respect for how he always did it, and I thank him for that.Today I raise my voice in this plenary on behalf of the European Parliament's committee in order to once again draw attention to the shipwreck of the oil tanker Erika and to express our concern.A two -time political consideration causes our committee - and as its chairman - to come back to this matter again.First, to prove to the Commission, the Council and the Member States that our parliament can neither forget this serious misfortune."	de
We must have the assurance that the Council act in accordance with the way of proceeding from the Parliament.For other themes, no initiative has unfortunately been set up so far.At the time it is, we are still waiting.The European Space of Freedom, Security and Justice remains an area without clear regulations in important areas.However, we owe it to European citizens.After hearing the words of the Ministers of Justice and the Interior, I am optimistic.I conclude that we will succeed in the next six months.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I believe that the oral question of Ms. Terrón I Cusí is of interest to set foot in the dish, because six months after the establishment of our new parliament, we must be able to send a strong political message to European citizens.I believe that the Portuguese presidency can contribute positively.We all know today the immense expectations of our fellow citizens in matters of freedom, security and justice, especially social.But their disinterest, their distance, sometimes even their disgust for the political thing involves taking concrete measures in the face of their difficulties.This is the sine qua non condition to reconcile them with politics.For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity, it takes a daring and generous policy, to help the poorest.A real plan to combat unemployment must be put in place, because it is the scourge on which racism, xenophobia, nationalism and racist far-right movements.Among the most deprived, and it is important that I intervene on this point, there are immigrants and refugees.Thus the conditions of almost systematic detention, the criminalization of the asylum seeker are no longer acceptable.Any asylum seeker must benefit from the right to a fair hearing and a suspensive appeal.I attended, last week, a little by chance, at Roissy airport, with a scene of rare violence where two young women, certainly clandestine, were renewed in Conakry.They were treated as the worst criminals.They were naked, dragged on the ground by the hair, framed by a horde of CRS.The Portuguese presidency must end this kind of barbaric practices.On the contrary, our role is to support, reassure, help those who flee dictatorships.The Commission had proposed the creation of a European fund for refugees.Parliament was very favorable.Instead of procrastinating on the budget granted to this fund, I think you can make the decision to set it up.The presidency and the council can concretize what has been rejected in an incomprehensible way to Tampere, even if Tampere was an important foundation.In the same way, we cannot be content to see the rise of xenophobic currents in Europe, the trivialization of discrimination, without taking major measures.The harmonization of legislation against racism is essential.What sense do you intend to give to article 13 of the treaty?What do you plan to do to promote equal treatment in terms of wages between men and women?How do you intend to work on the eradication of homophobia, racism and sexism?	fr
"Mr President, Ladies and Members, at the end of this debate, which I have followed with great attention and a lot of interest, I would like to give some considerations that add to what I have had in recent weeks in the presence of President Prodi before you.Your two rapporteurs, the Messrs of Dimitrakopoulos and Linen, recommend that the Parliament be accepted a formal statement in accordance with Article 48 in their very thorough and carefully developed report, so that the government conference can actually start work on February 14, as the Portuguese presidency proposed.On our part, after we have submitted the statement to be drawn up by the Commission on the basis of the Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that this conference can begin - otherwise thought earlier than originally thought.We know that the weeks obtained will be very useful.After reading the design of the statement and after the explanations of the speakers of the individual factions, I would like to add a few comments.First of all, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has an understanding of the concerns expressed several times about the scope of the agenda of the conference.I understand these fears, these concerns that the agenda is too scarce;And yet I believe that, as I did after the Helsinki summit, you can work for constitutional questions in front of the committee, based on Helsinki's mandate.And in this spirit and within the framework of this mandate, the Commission has developed its own statement, whereby it fully exhausted the mandate and also read between the lines.We have not limited ourselves to what is incorrectly referred to as the three ""remnants"".Like Richard Corbett, I don't like the expression ""remnant"", which gives the impression that these are three insignificant or incidental topics.However, there are three extremely serious, important and difficult topics - so difficult that in Amsterdam the common political courage was not sufficient to treat them exhaustively.As for us - here I answer Mr. Seguro, who was concerned beforehand - we did not satisfy ourselves with these three topics, even if I think that they have priority and have to be treated now.They are the first, but not the only topics of which the conference must take on, Mr.We have also dealt with other topics, and we have shown our idea that because of the difficult situation before the expansion, other topics at the conference would have to be addressed - if the Portuguese and then later the French presidency are ready.We are ready - whether it is now the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the elaboration of which has started, the GASP and the effects of negotiations on a defense policy on the institutions or the very difficult topic of revising the contracts where we will continue to work.There were many comments on the commission's statement;All of these topics were addressed and often treated in detail, some based on exact suggestions for new articles.But nobody mentioned that we were outside of Helsinki's mandate."	de
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen the commissioners, when this assembly is called to reflect on the theme of human rights, it runs a great risk which in a way was also emphasized by the climate in which we are called to debate this theme so important.The absence of the Council and almost all the deputies makes us aware of the abyss which still separates the noble deep and useful declarations on the formal level of the concrete application, in the field of daily policy, of human rights.I think that this Parliament, starting with the contribution that Europe will bring to the meeting of Geneva, must climb this chasm and act, not only in terms of principles, but also on that of truth and even loyalty.Human rights should not be the subject of an interpretation that is only linked to denunciation or punishment.We must, as Parliament, look at the subject of human rights especially in the sense of prevention.We must therefore be able to export a culture of legality, a culture of law, compliance of law.I believe that the long season of accumulation of treaties and signatures of treaties has definitively ended.Today we have many, perhaps too many, treated that intervene in terms of human rights: if these treaties remain only a simple utterance, they will only constitute unnecessary collections of reflection.We must go today to the next phase, that of the daily and coercive application of what is written in our treaties, even if we must not forget that certain fundamental treaties must still be accepted.I am thinking here of the Rome conference and of the fact that fourteen of the Fifteen States of the Union have not yet ratified the Treaty on the International Criminal Tribunal.I think we must verify and modify certain political instruments that serve us to measure the quality of human rights in the world.We have often used instruments which, formally, can be practical but which, on a political level, prove to be completely useless.I am thinking of the use, or even abuse, of embargo in recent years and of the too cautious application of the suspension clause of agreements between the European Union and third countries in case these do not respect human rights.I believe that we are mainly invited to update the horizon of the protection of fundamental rights.Globalization is likely to be interpreted as essentially repressive.In many countries, the principle of human rights are for the moment calls into question;It is believed that these rights and the right to life, denied by the death penalty, are dependent variables, while globalization, often taken in a punitive sense, risks being the only unifying tissue of the rights, actions and policies of all the countries of the world.	fr
Therefore, I think it is necessary to act in two directions.On the one hand, we should ask the Commission to grant special measures as part of the aid sector intended for the fishing sector in order to relieve the effects of this catastrophe on the productive sector of the affected areas, and also ask them to demand strict control of the ships driving under cheap flags.In this regard, the current negotiating process on Malta's joining the European Union must serve to demand from this country that it is rigorously checking the oil tankers driving under its flag.On the other hand, it is necessary to prevent.Portugal is a country that has given its sensitivity to the topics associated with the sea.I would like to ask the Portuguese presidency to examine the possibility of starting a comprehensive strategy for contraception of marine pollution at European level and to concentrate all means - technological, structural and socio -economic nature - from which we already have to prevent a disaster like this in the future.Finally, I would like to highlight the work done by the volunteers and the local authorities, which reminded me of old times when I experienced similar situations at the time.One has to thank them who, given the defenselessness and missing funds, courageous against the serious effects of this catastrophe for the coastal regions, for the ecosystem of the sea and the fishing resources of Europe.Mr President, as chairman of the committee for regional policy, transport and tourism, I would like to congratulate the Commission, especially Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, as to this incident, which was deeply shaken by all of Europe.In the traffic committee, we are ready to debate questions about marine safety and later, of course, about the conclusions that result from the conclusions that arise at the legal level.Allow me a few more remarks: First, the Commission has really focused on what guilt the Italian classification company Rina affects, because it must be checked whether the joint law has been applied.Here we have to start with our efforts.Secondly, in such cases, we should examine whether the charterers, for example the oil companies, are responsible in addition to the shipping companies, since they are complicit on environmental disasters like this and consequently must also pay for the removal of the damage.Apart from that, the reactions to the ecological disaster are justified in every respect.However, this must not tempt us to pillorate the entire merchant shipping, this sector that is so important for the economy, which covers around a third of the transport volume.So we have to react moderately, strict, but also sensibly.I am not at all against the fact that it is considered about the tightening of community law, but we, as other colleagues, must have emphasized from the implementation, because - and we must not forget that - there is already a legal framework at the level of the European Union.This frame is developed enough, at least if you compare the different regulations worldwide.As a result, the Member States, even under the supervision of the Commission, must finally begin to apply community law.	de
I have the great pleasure of immediately giving in the word to Prime Minister António Guterres.I thank the President in office for the Council, António Guterres, and I immediately pass the word to the president of the Commission, Romano Prodi..Lady president, first of all I would like to make my hottest congratulations to Prime Minister Guterres for the initiative that was taken for the Lisbon summit, and congratulate me for the quality of the preparatory works.We fully share his analysis that we have heard and that has been so highly applauded, and we support his initiative.I think together we can make Lisbon a successful summit.In this intervention of mine I will limit myself to presenting the contribution of the Commission for Lisbon: our long -term strategy and our vision for this summit.In Lisbon we have to decide on something extremely simple, namely if Europe will be able to regain its leadership position, for a long time lost, within the economy and technology.This depends on us, on the economic growth that we will be able to impose on the European system, on the degree of employment that we will be able to create, from the level of education of our citizens, from the formation of our working class.These are not new themes, as has been said by Prime Minister Guterres.We do not do, in fact, another exercise like Luxembourg, like Cardiff, type colony, but we want to deal with these themes, which we have already addressed, with a completely new approach: not one topic at a time but all together, to finally build a system of interventions.We do it now because it is the moment when all this may be successful.In fact, we have a unique opportunity in front of us, an opportunity that has been built on the success of a wise policy implemented in the recent past: we have low inflation, a balance of globally healthy payments, public accounts in order, and we finally have the unanimous forecasts of very strong economic growth, forecast, as the Portuguese Prime Minister pointed out, which do not mean certain of economic growth.Never as now, in the last generation, there has been unanimity by all scholars in Europe on providing for a possible long period of high growth.Not even with the increase in the price of oil there was an interruption in this growth or a recovery of inflation, as could be feared.However, there are some worrying signs, but they do not prevent us from continuing a development policy as we had thought and planned.The challenges of Lisbon are therefore very simple: to the technological challenge we must respond by recovering the lost ground in the field of knowledge, knowledge, technologies, especially of reforming technologies.We can thus return to a head position;For this reason we took the E-European initiative, thanks to which the Commission decided, in its administrative reform, to give a concrete example.We are committed - and it is a commitment that I confirm in front of you - to create a commission, we could better say an e -commission, in the sense that any relationship of supplies, research, etc. with this institution will no longer have to take place by paper but by direct electronic way.	it
"Large public investments have been made at federal, state and local scale.They have been huge and have been investments in the new infrastructure.Be careful, here our direct effort, I repeat, direct at public level and at different levels is to build telematic highways, that is, the roads through these new vehicles circulating.The market, individuals, companies will build vehicles to circulate, but it is we who have the obligation to build the new highways.Therefore, what Prime Minister Mr. Guterres about computers in all schools, about the network that must include all peripheral regions, is not an obligation that can be imposed exclusively to the market, since the market does not do so and, on the other hand, without it we do not reach those new development and productivity objectives that are necessary.Therefore, our problem is to avoid the crisis of peripheral economies, which does not imply a centralization or centralized programming, but it means to provide peripheral economies with the same opportunities that we provide to centralized economies.This is why the program must be directed to schools, so we must take a whole kind of age and insist, get that in that class there is no longer anyone who is outside the new literacy.Lisbon, therefore, has a very precise strategy.In Lisbon, in my opinion, the real problem is to inject a new value for employment, for growth knowing that we can do it and, therefore, we must go to this model that is based on safe balances.To summarize today's debate, I want to remember a phrase used by one of his honor, if I remember I remember Mr. Goebbels, who said: ""We have a future deficit in Europe.""It's simply this.We have complained for a long time, while maturing, on the other hand, the seeds of what we had put with great sacrifice in the roots of Europe.Now, please, let's also try to close the future deficit and make sense of new generations thinking that we are working in sobriety but seriously for something lasting.It is clear that then it is essential to gather the three processes.Unfortunately, our terminology is horrendous, but the problems of macroeconomy, work and structural problems really brought them together, now, and then we have the ability and possibility of achieving the results we wanted, with very simple, even specific actions.We remember European society: we have not yet achieved unanimity in relation to European society, but there are hundreds of thousands of companies that ask us.It must be done at all costs because only the idea of ​​acting in fifteen states that are becoming only one with different rules regarding the basic principles of the company is an unsustainable idea: we do not manage to sell it because it makes no sense.The same applies to the European patent: we also neither manage to sell it;the provisions related to public competitions, the capital market;Also the seeds of the Social Security Coordination, because it is useless that we think of great mobility opportunities, that we make very successful programs such as Erasmus, Socrates to make people more mobile, if we do not have social security standards that do not help us in this mobility."	es
Mr. Commissioner, we are facing a reform that there are no qualifiers that are exaggerated to say how important it is.It transcends competition, transcends the cohesion of the internal market, I think it deeply affects what is the sense of European integration, the sense of the legitimacy of European integration.Therefore, we count, Mr. Commissioner, with that inter -institutional dialogue to profile a reform that we all expect and to which we consider that we will bring to fruition with its piloting and our cooperation.Mr. President, Lordship, I thank the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great interest shown by the issues of the competition.Mr. President, in my opinion, this joint debate is the most living and valuable testimony of it.We have heard very deep considerations that, at the same time, are of philosophy of economic policy and analysis of the institutional structure.Our common attempt is to modernize and strengthen the policy of competition, pillar of the social economy of market and European construction.The conductive thread of all these aspects of reform of the competence policy, which we are going to deal with jointly, is a conductive thread oriented to guarantee a more effective protection of the competition, to reduce the bureaucratic weight that taxes on companies and to bring the processes of decisions to citizens closer.I want to thank you personally and deeply to Mr. Von Wogau the effort with which the white dossier and the quality of his report have examined.I would like to group the considerations that have been made throughout the debate on the Von Wogou report in four points that I do not consider as criticism of the Commission, but fundamental contributions, since there are concerns that it is fair to have and that we want to overcome together: the question of efficacy, the question of the risk of renationalization, the question of coherence in the application, the question of legal certainty.I will examine them one by one very quickly.Effectiveness: I am convinced that this reform allows reinforcing and not weakening the protection of competition in the scope of the single market.Avilies, the current notification system no longer allows this objective to be achieved, because it does not guarantee the information of the Commission on the most serious restrictions - a agreement that only nine prohibition decisions have been adopted after a notification and in the absence of denunciation - it does not guarantee transparency and does not provide a true legal certainty to the companies that, in most cases, receive a simple administrative letter of file.The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, first of all because it will allow the commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions and, therefore, because it will imply a greater extent to national authorities and competition in the repression of violations and, finally, because it will allow the victims of infractions to go directly to national judges, whose mission is to protect subjective rights.The issue of renationalization: first of all, although it is superfluous, I would like to remember and underline, if possible three times, that the white paper does not affect the most concentrations and state aids - we are not thinking of a return in these matters - but, as regards regulation No. 17, there is a risk of renationalization.	es
"We know the rest.It would then be necessary to establish a reliable technical control like the compulsory technical control in France for vehicles of more than five years.It would be necessary to regulate the use of pavilions of complacency, require the double hull for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, innovate in technological matters to manage to treat or collect hydrocarbons at sea. It would be, I think, a minimum, at the dawn of the third millennium.It would be necessary to prohibit the non-compliant ships access to European waters, determine the responsibility of polluters, shipowners, charters in the name of the ""polluter pays"" principle, strengthen maritime surveillance to avoid degassing, impose a serious and reliable control of tankers, restore a budgetary line ""natural"" consequent "", for member countries, and in the meantimeeligible for structural funds the disaster departments.I also deposited on behalf of the EDD group a resolution on this subject.The President, in recent years, of disasters involving oil tankers have regularly occurred around the world, without taking measures worthy of the name or effective.This time, it is particularly serious, and this too because it affected a great European state, an event that can happen at any time.To limit these dangers, we have the urgent need for a directive.Fifteen manifestly are not enough for it.Without claiming completeness, it would guarantee at least three points: no cargo or oil will no longer be able to wet in a port of the European Union if it is good for breakage;All those concerned, including the transportation of transport, are responsible for the damage that may occur;And these people must contract sufficient insurance.It is only in this way that the victims will have a chance to see their requests for compensation.However, we must see that the long -term objective must still go further.This means that we must really establish the truth of costs for the entire energy supply system.Mr. President, let me start by thanking Ms. Palacio Commissioner for the appropriate, clear and firm answer that she gave.I thank him very, very sincerely.This means that I also have the biggest esteem for the information note that she sent us on January 10 but also for the actions that she announced today.The Erika disaster highlights the fact that when strict transportation regulations are lacking at European and international level, nature and the environment always suffer.The resulting damage, especially from an ecological point of view, do not express themselves in money.This is also why the debate takes place in common with the colleagues of transport and the environment.During the Christmas holidays, when the Dutch media looked at the disaster of the Erika, I went to throw a stroke of the Internet to get an idea of ​​the situation and see what measures it would be necessary to take, especially after Prime Minister Jospin said that Europe should be more active in this area."	fr
The commission's delays must be reflected in the proposed calendar, so the date of 2003 must necessarily be reviewed.At the same time that defines a sector reserved for postal public operators, based on weight and price limits, the directive on postal services would allow liberalization of stages and controlled.The brutal reduction of these limits calls into question the balance between public service obligation and economic viability for postal services.In a context of globalization, where the logic of profitability and benefit is increasingly opposed to the interest of balance of territories and social cohesion, it is urgent to remember here our adhesion to the European public service well ties today to the postal sector, tomorrow to the railway or the day after the health sector tomorrow.Mr. President, I take the floor as well as other Scottish members of this assembly, representatives of Scotland, to protest against anything that gives rise to a decrease in the quality of rural life in remote areas.The service and post offices are an essential element of the life of rural communities throughout Europe, not to mention Scotland.It would be a disaster that, intentionally or even without knowing it, measures will be taken whose effect was harming them.I don't think it's anyone's intention to do something like that.Nor do I believe that the commission has proposed to declare war on the islands of Scotland or Greece.But they could accidentally cause great damage.The question is to determine at what speed and with what methods the gradual liberalization of postal services would have to be carried out.If a limit too low was set to continue the right of monopoly of the postal service, it would be antieconomic to maintain the universality of the service in remote areas with a price that remained affordable.The crucial issue is to find a balance between universality and affordable price.The message that is transmitted today very clearly from all parts of the Assembly to the Commission is that it must walk with lead feet.I should not, for example, take a leap from 350 grams to, as someone has suggested, 50 grams.On the contrary, I should be careful.I imagine that anything less than 150 grams would be extremely reckless in these circumstances.The solidarity and cohesion of the peoples throughout Europe depends on thinking that a letter can be sent anywhere and that will deliver anywhere else, all with a reasonable price seal.Let's defend universality and affordable price!Mr. President, to guarantee a quality postal service of quality, it is essential that its public character be maintained.The Universal Service, which entails an offer of quality postal services at affordable prices and provided in all points of the territory, constitutes the basis of the entire operation of the postal system and must promote a uniform rate throughout the national territory.Now, so that it is, it is essential that it be maintained as a public service.Only in this way is it possible to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, is a comprehensive network that cannot be fragmented or used only in part according to the conveniences of postal service operators.	es
However, unfortunately the fear that this leads to the creation of a European institution that restricts subsidiarity remains too great.In any case, I am going to contribute to the part that corresponds to me to swell the support in favor of Mrs. Theato's report.Mr. President, we are basically in favor of the resolution that has been presented to us, although we think that it can only be an invitation from Parliament to the Council so that, through a modification of the treaties, an effective criminal protection of the financial interests of the Union is guaranteed.The institution of a European prosecutor and the establishment of criminal figures common to all the states of the Union is, without a doubt, a good idea, however, I consider impossible to think of putting it into practice without first having created a court order of the Union.We are talking, in effect, a criminal law, a field in which the resistance of national states to community is and will always be strong.In fact, it is unthinkable that substantive and procedural legal norms can be established for a single area such as the protection of financial interests, without having previously created a European court order.It is enough to read the precise and exhaustive motivations of the Theato report to realize how many and what are the problems still pending solution.However, this idea must be promoted and there is no doubt that in this attempt to protect financial interests we will realize the need to have a community juris corpus that must be incorporated into the treaties.On behalf of my group and in mine, I also express the desire that the financial soul of the Union serves as a guide for the establishment of a European court order respectful of the rights and guarantees of citizens, that is, of a court order that increases the guarantees that, unfortunately, in many states there are no acceptable levels.Consequently, on behalf of my group, I express a favorable judgment on the Theato report;However, I consider that, in the substantial aspect, it is an issue that must be included in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.Mr. President, the report of Mrs. Theato on the protection of the financial interests of the European Union proposes, in particular, in a first phase, centralize the criminal proceedings through the creation of a European prosecutor.This proposal is radically against the spirit of the current system, in which criminal law and criminal procedure, which constitute the core of national legal systems, must depend on the sovereignty of each people and be the exclusive competence of each State.Now, the idea of ​​a European prosecutor, on the contrary, aims to relegate the states to a subordinate role in these issues.In addition, this proposal would trigger a succession of absolutely unpredictable reforms.According to the Theato Report, the European prosecutor would be necessary, in particular, to better frame the investigations of the Office to Fight Fraud, the Olaf.But in parallel we find out, in the Van Hulten report that is debated today, that the European prosecutor would also be monitored by a European Union court.	es
I therefore delighted that the responsibility is attributed to individuals without the commission relieving its responsibility.In practice, experiences - only 9 files have been refused, 94 % of the cases that the Commission had to deal with were not formally settled but via unpublished administrative letters, legally non -binding, or simply by expiration of the time -clever period clearly that at the age of globalization and the enlargement of the EU, the work of the Commission is limited by temporal, personal and financial constraints.To conclude, I would like to say what I expect from this reform: fair competition and the same conditions of competition for all, legal security for all businesses, a uniform application of competition policy, a simplification of procedures in accordance with the principle of the one -stop shop, the coordination of the national authorities that I believe I should be independent, close cooperation of the authorities and national courses with the Commission as well as a clear distribution of skills andnationals in the application of European competition law and agreements.From the Commission, I expect that it focuses on the essentials by accomplishing its main guardians of European competition policies.I look forward to seeing what form will take the vast discussions in the first legislative proposal.The Commission's report confirms that, aside from Germany, state aid to businesses are increasing.This only worries the Commission from the point of view of the conditions of competition.For our part, we place ourselves from the point of view of the interest of laborious classes.The company does not gain anything from these enormous transfers of public funds to private companies.Look at the automobile, where subsidies and various aids of states increased by 24 % during the reference period.What to do?It is not to preserve jobs.All of these companies have made job cuts, or even layoffs.It is not to improve working conditions, because by producing more workers, working conditions worsen.Do these companies need the help of states to survive?No, car companies have had colossal profits for years.State aid is not only perverse, because, as the Jonckheer report recognizes, they lead to a hunt for subsidies by relocations from one country to another, they are unacceptable because they devote public money to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders.It is because everywhere we promote the richest with state money that everywhere in Europe we reduce social protection, we abandon public services, we close hospitals.The meaning of my vote against the Jonckheer report is to assert the need for another policy, that is to say the cessation of all aid to private companies and the use of money thus saved to develop public services and hire staff.Mr. President, the debate that we hold today is of extraordinary importance because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the domestic market.Pursuant to the principle of competition, the regulations have developed articles 85 to 94, properly said competition policy, the revision of all state aid and tax provisions likely to distort competition.	fr
In the next resolution of the CIG, the Parliament will have to deal in depth the issues of diversification and flexibility.If we cannot create that system with concentric layers proposed by the liberal group, we will endanger the expansion and integration process.My colleagues, the honorable Frassoni and the honorable Honesty, have already expressed a somewhat skeptical opinion on some aspects of the question we are dealing with;I would like to manifest my concern regarding subsidiarity, not so much as regards the relations between the Union and the Member States, but rather for the relationships between the individual Member States and the Regions who, within them, enjoy administrative autonomy.It is a topic on which it has not been reflected enough and which is a source of concern from many points of view.I would like to point out above all one of the consequences that the expansion will have on this parliament.A roof of 700 deputies has been set, which represents the maximum number of members with which Parliament can continue to work as a deliberating assembly.By applying the principle of digressive proportionality (six seats for each state and then one more seat for every half million inhabitants) we already reach a situation for which Luxembourg, with 367,000 inhabitants, sends more deputies of Wales in this parliament, region which, within the United Kingdom, enjoys a partial administrative autonomy;Scotland, who has 5 million inhabitants, today has 8 deputies to the European Parliament, while Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have 16. What will happen now if we keep the roof of 700 members, we gradually increase the population of the European Union of 26 percent and then we adopt the proposal (in my opinion unhappy) of the Commission to form a list of candidates on a European basis?What will happen to a country like Scotland that I represent here?It will become completely invisible!Given the circumstances, the deputies of this Parliament should not be surprised if, discussing these issues, public opinion, in Scotland and in other countries that are in the same situation, begins to ask whether the expansion should not take on the form of an admission of new member states belonging to those already existing.In Scotland an ever stronger current of opinion is being oriented in this sense.Mr. President, he has often heard that the European Union is at a crossroads.This time it is the truth: we have started - with great success - the single currency and the expansion awaits us.We wonder if we head prepared or not towards the expansion.Will it be an expansion on the surface or in depth?This is the hazel of the debate when it comes to the intergovernmental conference, the agenda and the method.Evidently the Council has chosen, for now, to expand without deepening.This is a danger to expansion;A danger to any perspective of political union.Public opinion will have difficulty understanding.The advice must realize that, if we want the future of the union to be built on the foundations of a solid expansion, it is necessary to go much further in the next intergovernmental conference.	it
The crisis of the Commission was, in fact, a crucial point of the relationship between Europe and its citizens, and the low participation in the European elections was a worrying sign.Even deeper, however, is the sense of insecurity, the feeling of unpreparedness in the face of a new world that advances, a world that changes totally, which through globalization ends up changing even our reference points.It is not a completely new fact in history: already Europe has already found itself in front of an similar change, an explosion of its markets, to a change in the reference parameters, to a different perception of the world.I am referring to the sixteenth century, after the discovery of America, in which everything has changed.Some countries - such as France and Spain - have been able to respond to the challenge giving life to the great national states;Other countries - such as Italy - have not held up to this challenge and lost all the primates who in the first part of the millennium had accumulated: primates of science, technology, economic progress, defense and military organization, thought and literature.Today Europe is faced with a similar challenge, and we know that, as history has not forgiven in the past, so it does not forgive today.In this perspective of great changes, to prevent our national states from disappearing in the face of globalization, which places unprecedented dimensions and challenges in our history, an economically strong Europe is necessary, because globalization imposes unity, because every day there is news of new agreements worldwide and every day there is news of changes even at European level.But even more necessary it is a Europe that feels strong in the political field.In past years the single market and the single currency have been the fulcrum of our action, the main element of European life.Today, the new frontiers of European integration are political borders: foreign policy and common security, justice and internal security and - in order - the crucial question of the fundamental political values ​​on which our coexistence stands.For this reason, the Commission approved the 2000-2005 strategic plan, a plan that was immediately sent to the European Parliament, which you already know and which, therefore, in this speech of mine I will not resume in detail.Someone may consider it perhaps too synthetic, but no political structure produces detailed five -year plans.This is the European Union, it is not the Soviet Union.Our plan identifies the great reference points, the great directions of intervention: first, the development of new forms of government for Europe;second, the expansion and enlargement of the peace, freedom, security area;third, the launch of a new phase of economy development;fourth, the protection and improvement of the quality of life.These are our great action directives for the next five years.Regarding the first - the new forms of government for Europe - you already know that the Commission has committed itself to presenting a white photographer, and not a complete legislative text since, in the face of the great problems that structurally change our way of being together, the commission first prepares the debate;Then discuss the content with you;Hence a political document, finally a legislative document was born.	it
It will then be necessary, as I pointed out, to change the paradigm and to forget the post-colonial paradigm to give a more European dimension to development policies.From this point of view, I think (like some stakeholders) that the new convention called to replace Lomé conventions constitutes an important instrument for renovation and new dynamics in the approach of a partnership with such a large group of countries in the South, at the time when there is stability around the negotiation processes on an international scale, like those who characterized the first cycle of Seattle negotiations.I feel a certain degree of frustration in many contributions to this debate.I made before you a declaration on behalf of the commission which, I think, offers a useful framework for this discussion.We will provide more detailed information directly linked to all consistency issues.This debate is not new.We are working there for the time in the Commission and, the work completed, I will present a report in the matter, since many were those who asked if it was possible to see the report on consistency.I have no doubt that, due to the growing political attention granted to these problems which clearly emerged from today's debate -it will be easier for the Commission and the DG of development to place the question of coherence at the top of our work order.This also requires the introduction of new additional mechanisms within the commission system which may very well include, as some political groups of this Parliament suggested, the establishment of a special interservice working group and a form of coherence control within the Commission.I read - and heard during the debate - that consistency is used as a kind of miracle formula that suits everything.I think it is important to leave it to the relatively well defined discipline rank aimed at trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist, and there are most certainly.This is largely linked to a real disagreement between sectoral interests in each Member State, as has been said with great honesty in this assembly.People identify in a way with their spheres of interest, which is legitimate.However, I would like to warn against the illusion that the inconsistency results from a certain mechanical disability of the system.This happens but represents only a small part of what we are talking about.Most of the debate relates to the well -known differences in interest established between the sexes and so on, and there is the problem.Mr. Mulder said that no farmer will begin to produce anything if the price is too low.This is true in our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective.They are farmers, not only to earn a living, but also to live, that makes a difference.	fr
Just recently we had the opportunity to resort to the precautionary principle to prohibit phthalates in soft PVC toys and of course we apply it in numerous environmental sectors.Mostly it is used when it comes to environmental problems, but of course even when human health comes into play.We will therefore try to define the cases in which this principle must be applied with extreme clarity.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, as regards the relationship between science on the one hand and appeal to the principle of precaution on the other, in communication it is argued that the use of this principle always requires a political decision in the event of lack of scientific evidence.With this statement, great power to science is attributed.We can ask ourselves who the experts who will provide the required documentation and what a position will defend.The communication also reads that even a sufficient and recognized minority of scientific experts can invoke the precautionary principle.I would like to know then what is the definition of recognized minority.How can you give a description of this concept?How do you create a recognized minority?If then it is a political decision, I would like to know who will adopt it.The Commission?The advice?What will be the role assigned to the European Parliament?What is the role of scientific committees?What will be the role of the authorities in the food field that will be designated shortly?Finally, will the decision -making process occur to the sign of transparency and advertising?These are the three questions that I would like to ask.This is the right, Mr. President, the problems have been many, complex and sometimes dark, but I will also try to respond.Who will you have to decide and what are the decision -making centers?It depends on those who play the role of legislator;It is part of the management of risks.For example, we will need to consider the concerns of public opinion on a specific problem and judge according to the scientific tests available for a certain case.It is true, however, that a strong majority of the scientific community is not necessary to resort to the principle of precaution;It is sufficient that there is evidence made by a minority, or that science is not able to give precise answers.In this way, a balance is maintained between the use of this principle as a political tool and science.It is not always easy to precisely describe the performance of this process, but it is not a question of changing the scientific method.We resort to experts to acquire as many information and scientific facts as possible before making a decision and it seems to me that in the future it will be good to behave in this way.This method must be considered as a tool for the management of risks: it must be decided, for example, if you have to allow the population to be exposed to any risk, or if you want to protect the environment.It is therefore necessary to take into account the available scientific data.We must evaluate all these factors and evaluate what science tells us, and then decide whether or not to adopt a measure, whether to act or not.There is therefore no answer to all questions, but this does not change the scientific system we have today, nor the way we use the experts today.	it
Amendment n.18 refers to Directive 96/71 relating to the minimum wages, a directive that already finds application for which no changes to the text is needed.If the Commission welcomed amendment no.17, this would imply the introduction of a simple notification obligation in case of non -release of a valid card.It is evident that this provision is in contrast with the interests of the Member States on public order.We cannot also welcome amendment no.19 For the considerations that I have already presented in relation to amendment no.10. The position of the Commission is substantially the same also in relation to similar amendments presented for the second proposal.I also allow me to add that amendment no.10 The second proposal is absolutely unacceptable.Compared to amendment no.15 relating to the definition of self -employed workers, as I have detected a few indeed, the Commission will seek an adequate solution that takes into account the objections raised.I now come to the observation of Lord English.He referred to the existing borders checks for the United Kingdom.In this regard, I would like to note that there is no obligation by virtue of which a Member State - and therefore also the United Kingdom - must abolish or modify the controls on the still existing boundaries.This applies, as I said, for the United Kingdom, but also applies to Belgium, where the problem has recently emerged.As for the observations of the honorable Karas, I have the impression that he refers to the possibility that workers from Poland will be employed in his country.The Commission would like to propose a solution applicable to all companies established in the European Union that employ workers from third countries.The problem is if the two cases must be addressed simultaneously.In my opinion, the question falls within the debate on the expansion of the European Union and perhaps should not be addressed here.On behalf of the commission, I would like to confirm to Honorable Karas that he is at his complete disposal if he needs more information on this really important point.Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the extremely constructive debate dedicated to the most important aspects of these proposals and, of course, express my gratitude to the rapporteur, honorable Berger.Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, at 11.00.Court of first instance Mr. President, I would like to start congratulating myself with the speaker for his relationship which, at a first reading, gives the impression of limiting himself to confirming and accepting.Behind this relationship, however, there is all long and effective work that has already produced some fruit;In fact, the commitment to expand the agenda of the intergovernmental conference to understand the study of a future modification of the organization, composition and competences of the Community courts was included in the document of the Finnish presidency of 7 1999.I therefore express my recognition to the work of the vice president Marinho.Mr. President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an urgent necessity if in the future you want to do justice within reasonable terms, if in the future the European Union wants to have justice at the height of the political project already started.	it
Mr. President, the Commission's proposal regarding the further controlled and gradual opening of the postal market to the competition is essentially late due to the reorganization of the services and the re -attribution of the Commission's skills, as well as the need for the new College REASAMINI these problems.As for the different resolutions of Parliament concerning the postal sector, my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, has already responded to the main observations during the hearings that were organized last year by Parliament.In addition, as regards the consultation of the Parliament, Commissioner Bolkestein will meet, next Monday, the Commission for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament.Studies were sent to this commission in September 1999, as well as to the parliamentarians who requested them, and are still available.These studies can also be consulted on the Commission's website.I am sure that Commissioner Bolkestein will pay due attention to all the observations of Parliament.The Commission, Mr. President, is firmly convinced of the need for a new proposal for the further development and evolution of the postal sector.In addition, the presentation of a proposal constitutes a legal obligation.They are able to confirm that it is a firm intention of Commissioner Bolkestein to present such a proposal to the Commission, to transmit it to Parliament and the Council, within the first half of the year.The date established for the realization of the next phase, on 1 January 2003, remains the ambition of the Commission.The proposal will take into account the studies carried out, and in particular of the need to ensure the universality of the service, the development of efficient safeguards for consumers, the creation of a climate favorable to new jobs and the solution of the problems related to competition.The role of the opening of the market, in view of the further modernization and improvement of postal services of the whole union with new technologies, will also be examined in view of the potential benefits for the industry as a whole.The proposal, when it is presented, will take into account the points of view expressed by the Member States, by Parliament, by users, by the loans of universal services, their competitors and other parties concerned, with which in -depth consultations have been carried out.The goal is to guarantee the proper functioning of the internal market of postal services in the interest of consumers and companies in the whole union.Mr Markov, he will be granted the right to intervene between 5-6 minutes, but in the meantime he has the courtesy not to interrupt the honorable colleagues.Mr. President, here is a mystery.What happened to the postal services directive that was approved on December 15, 1997?From that moment there has been a heavy silence from the Commission.I'm sorry that the Commissioner Monti has to answer.I respect him a lot and I think he is one of the most diligent and active commissioners.Unfortunately I can't say the same for some of his colleagues.In this period no progress has occurred in relation to the postal services directive.Commissioner Monti said that this must be partially attributed to organizational reasons and the re -attribution of skills.	it
This second option has prevailed and I congratulate myself, but I hope that, in the future, the coordination between the two institutions and the council is closer so that our work is more understandable, more fruitful and more productive.Mr. President, our objective by establishing a framework for investment funds and other OICVM is to guarantee the maximum benefits for the savings of our investors without subjecting them to large risks, which is why I want to refer to the issue of derivatives in my observations today.I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can contribute to consolidate more safe and higher benefits.Despite their dangerous reputation, derivatives are generally used by asset administrators as prevention.A contract that, for example, pays a substantial sum, if, say, the NASDAQ or CAC 40 index falls, causes an additional payment by the investor if the Nasdaq or Cac 40 index rises. Is that speculation?At all.Imagine that we have dedicated several months to create a portfolio of assets of companies that inspire us confidence: they are companies that have good management, good perspectives and represent a good investment.Then we are concerned that the entire stock market may fall, as happened in 1987. In that case we will have the option of selling everything and turning it into cash, but that would mean losing everything we have investigated on the winners.It would also mean incurring all the transaction expenses involved in the sale of our participations and then buy them again after the fall.The solution consists of taking out a derivative that compensates for us if Nasdaq or Cac 40 falls. But even with custom -measure or OTC derivatives, which would be cheaper, that they could ensure a relative fall of our portfolio with respect to the index, we would continue to have the portfolio and the participations, but we would have protected ourselves against the dangers of a plumme.In return, we may have undone of some of the most raising values ​​in the market.In that case, which may be the most widespread use of derivatives by asset administrators, we reduce our possible reward, but we also reduce our risk factor.It is a desirable development in a well -managed fund.History shows that investors benefit from a liberal and light approach.An authoritarian system - a prescription of how private sector administrators should invest and where they should invest - will only reduce the benefits for investors.The pension funds that are subject to the regulations on where they can invest and where not, as required for our state bonds, obtain benefits of annual 5.2%, barely half of the 9.5% annual benefits that obtained free funds between 1984 and 1996. We are naturally talking about benefits after having deduced all losses.Let's not confuse the real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of a new, innovative and liberal approach that is worth it.That's what we should take here today.Mr. President, the report that is presented to us aims to end the free movement of financial investments in Europe, even in its most sophisticated forms.	es
What can the European Union do in a context that, without interference in matters that are the exclusive competence of the Cypriots, can encourage the search for a right and lasting solution to this dramatic problem that affects a country linked to the European community for almost 30 years, which will be called to join the European Union in the coming years?I listened, in particular by the Council, proposals or somewhat ambiguous silences, which in my opinion must be clearly precise.I think it is up to us first to remember the main reference for the whole international community, i.e. the resolutions of the United Nations.According to the Security Council, the solution to the Cypriot problem must be sought in the framework of a bizonal, two -ome federation, in other words a unique state - Commissioner Verheugen has made an allusion to you - which entails two local mandatory administrations of the two communities.Sovereignty, international personality and citizenship must be unique and this state must be demilitarized.In this way the international community clearly indicates that it refuses the fact accomplished by force.Secondly, the European Union gains, I think, of reducing the position of interpretation of the position defined by the European Council of Helsinki as much as possible.The solution of the Cypriot problem cannot constitute a preliminary condition for the adhesion of Cyprus to the Union, as the honorable Poos recalled, otherwise it would in fact confer to Turkey a sort of veto right regarding the adhesion of Cyprus to the European Union, which is unacceptable.Finally, thirdly, the position of the European Council of Helsinki cannot instead lead to a reduction of the efforts we make to solve the cypriot problem before the entrance of the country in the Union.From this point of view, Helsinki's other decision, that is, the recognition of Turkey's candidacy for the Union, gives the fifteen a new responsibility while offering new possibilities to the Union.In my opinion, the dialogue with Ankara can and must integrate the determined will to obtain from Turkey the expression towards the dialogue between the two Cypriot communities of a constructive attitude, respectful of international legality and which allows you to get to the reunification of Cyprus and peace in the eastern Mediterranean.Mr. President, if on the importance of financial support in Cyprus and Malta we are practically all in agreement, the same cannot be said regarding the budget address book to draw on the necessary funds.The Council and the Commission propose to insert the protocols in Rubric 4, a proposal that is in line with the budget decisions adopted by Parliament last December;The speaker returns to his position and now proposes to enter the financial support in Cyprus and Malta in address book 7. For his part, the Commission for Budgets even proposes to postpone the approval of the Brok report until the Council decides to raise the ceiling of address book 7, but this is an extremely risky strategy because, without the preventive vote of Parliament, the financial protocols cannot be activated.Cyprus and Malta therefore find the costs of a political game conducted by the Council and Parliament on the ceilings.Moreover, what is the point of establishing ceilings if, then, at each new action, are they continuously high?	it
The presidency takes note of its concern and will forward it via the corresponding channels.Violence between the population groups in Mitrovica and the location of the Albanian prisoners in Serbia, especially the Flora Brovina case).(Fri) Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!We have not signed the present compromise closure application for two reasons.First of all, one of our colleagues, who is known for his open and tolerant attitude, made Mr. Sakellariou - as not to name - inserted his vehement veto against it because he wanted to defend their moral values.I do not doubt, and you will probably not doubt that this is a newly important contribution that he makes to the fight against racism and against intolerance.Second, the present application for a resolution is unfortunately not of very large scope.Through a number of tricks, it was possible to carefully avoid the treatment of the central question, namely the final status of Kosovo.Probably none of them should assume that Kosovo could one day belong to Yugoslavia.Likewise, none of them will accept that Milosevic could last for a long time if the international community would finally find a solution to the question of the final status of Kosovo.After all, none of them will believe that in the current situation Milosevic will have no interest in doing everything possible to destabilize Kosovo, which he does and what we have already experienced.Finally, in my opinion, none of them can believe that the current status quo only contributes to the stability and thus to the development of Kosovo.Incidentally, it is interesting to read a lapsus undertaking in the compromise application, which has undoubtedly missed them.They condemn the first immediate attack on KFOR members.I don't want you to be misfortune, but I'm afraid that you will ultimately be if you don't treat the real problem, and I make you fully responsible for what can happen.In my opinion, we have to ask the Commission and the Council, which is unfortunately absent today, to emphasize the question of the final status of Kosovo, the growing number of small states in this region, the development according to Dayton and finally the question of real stability, which finally enables the development of democracy in these countries.In conclusion, I would like to point out that we had asked for a determined action on the part of the Council and the Commission for the release of the 3,000 Kosovo-Albanian prisoners as well as Ms. Brovina, Mr. Kurti and Mr. Hoti.I find that the Union is facing a certain relaxation of the sanctions without so far only one of these prisoners have been released in return.For what reason?Mr. President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is terrible and reprehensible.Violence leads to violence, revenge creates revenge.The police forces sent are not strong enough to put an end to the processes.The senior police commissioner, Svend Frederiksen, has expressed his despair that he can only have over half of the agreed forces.	de
I have been informed that AIS is not pathological in the case of humans and mammals.The disease has existed since 1984 and it has not been reported that it has affected human health or mammals.The virus damages cold -blooded animals.It is not reproduced at temperatures above the 25th Celsius and if it were present in the fish destined for human consuming it would be inactive at the time of being ingested.However, no fish infected with human consumption can be used.As an added caution, I have made a consultation on this issue to the scientific committee.During the debate, several important issues have been mentioned, including compensation, related to our disease control strategy.I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry.They may know that with effect since January 15, 2000, within the framework of the new financial instrument for fishing orientation, Member States will support the eradication of diseases in aquaculture.The commission services are preparing execution standards to guarantee the practical application of this instrument.The decision of the Council 90/424 constitutes another instrument of community financial support in the case of disease outbreaks.However, I must emphasize that there are important impediments.Budget resources are very scarce and priorities with other diseases must be established.Therefore greater reflection is needed.I regret, therefore, not currently be able to accept amendments related to compensation through decision 90/424.This is especially the case of amendments 3 and 5. However, I agree with the affirmation of amendment 2 that says that no compensation has been paid to salmon fish farmers.I am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance.The Commission has included in its proposal the possibility of vaccinating salmon.The objective of this proposal is to introduce an instrument to combat the disease in emergency situations.I believe that a vaccine should not be used for preventive purposes as the amendment 4. The experience in other sectors has shown that preventive vaccination has the perverse effect of creating healthy virus carriers.This could perpetuate an infection.Therefore I cannot accept the amendment 4. You have also referred to the need to deepen scientific research on the nature of the disease.I agree that this research is necessary and I understand that it is currently being organized in the United Kingdom.I will follow the results of this investigation very closely and I will completely take it into account in future legislative proposals.It should be examined whether it is appropriate and how investigations should be organized in other places in the community.In this context, I am pleased to partially accept amendment 1 taking into account, however, that scientific research is not carried out by the Commission although it trusts the results of the investigations carried out in the Member States.I can also partially accept the fragment of amendment 6 that says that Directive 93/53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence.As I have highlighted the scientific evidence available are that AIS does not constitute a threat to health.	es
The opportunity to extend the agenda remains to be discussed.In this regard, I wish to praise the political attitude held by the Portuguese presidency which, before Parliament, has repeatedly committed to making the necessary efforts in this direction.On the other hand, the possible extension of the agenda must not affect the importance that each Member State must attribute to the CIG, since the institutional framework on which the Europe of the future will be based represents the foundation of European integration and is therefore a question of maximum importance for each country of the Union.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, in light of this I ask the assembly to approve the opinion presented by the Honorable Leinen and the undersigned, so that on February 14 the works of the CIG begin, where our representatives, honorable Brok and Tsatsos, will face a difficult task on the basis of the opinion in accordance with Parliament.This also applies to the commission and I take the opportunity to thank Commissioner Barnier again for his contacts with Parliament and for his very constructive proposals.Mr. President, the group of the European People's Party is not satisfied with the result of the European Council of Helsinki.The agenda seemed small in it because we wanted to focus on the treaty, with particular attention to the protocol on the institutions of the Union.In Helsinki, governments have agreed that, until the union is made up of less than 21 states, a minimum reform will be sufficient;In reality, a profound reform would be needed.Helsinki's European Council itself has approved the expansion to thirteen new Member States.There is evidently a contradiction between the opening of adhesion negotiations and the will of a minimum reform.Our attention is turned to the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next intergovernmental conference to reach a deeper reform of the Union.Mr President, this debate takes place today because we did not want to postpone the start of the conference.We could have done it;We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the conference could not have started on the 14th. However, we did not do it because we wish to launch a clear political signal to governments and the countries candidates for membership regarding our desire to proceed with this reform precisely to facilitate the expansion.I am pleased to be able to say it to the Portuguese presidency, which has acquired great credit in the eyes of the classroom. The Portuguese presidency shares many aspirations of this parliament and has committed itself to do everything possible because the agenda of the intergovernmental conference is plumped with other absolutely necessary themes.This aspiration of the European Parliament, Mr President, is not an interested aspiration.However, the European Parliament will come out politically strengthened by the Treaty deriving from this intergovernmental conference, for a simple reason: the conference, according to what was agreed in Helsinki, will examine on what topics will be moved from the current decision to unanimously to the decision by qualified majority.It is therefore destined to increase the number of themes on which it will decide by qualified majority.It is now a community heritage that in the legislative issues for which it is decided by qualified majority there is also the codecision of Parliament.	it
That can't go on like this.In the event of a crisis, it must be clear from the outset that the polluter is liable.President!It was a very good white book and not a word from me to the authority.My questions affect the positive list for feed.You are unclear in your white book.What is your schedule, how quickly will you come with a positive list?When are the same requirements for feed and generation placed as in the production and control of the production of food?The last part of my question: When will BSE tests be binding in all member countries?Also there they have remained somewhat unclear in their white book.I would like to thank the commission member for his statements.I think the criteria set for the food authority are a concession to reality.The Member States would not accept an authority with regulatory powers, so such a proposal would therefore have little sense.Some areas of the food industry clearly need better regulation, and this applies in particular to feed.As chair of a committee, which will probably deal almost exclusively with food in the next three years, I have to ask the following question: If Europe, as you said, has the safest food control system, what do we need 24 new guidelines and regulations and 20 new guidelines to change guidelines?Secondly: Will this not increase the problem of over -regulation by Brussels and the lack of implementation by the Member States?To expand: How do the commission's plans for the involvement of the candidates to be included in the debate about these new laws, especially since the Commission clearly assumes that the laws provided for in the white book will be part of the common acquis?Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Ms. Ahern, Ms. Roth-Behrendt and Ms. Jackson for her support for the white book.I find that encouraging, and I look forward to further discussions with you and other MPs of Parliament on the topics mentioned therein.Ms. Ahern asked about liability.This question is not expressly dealt with in the white book.It is only mentioned that we will make regulations regarding traceability.There are already some of them.Then we can devote ourselves to the problem of liability.Despite my own background, I have not yet dealt with problems with the question of liability, but I believe that subsidiarity may play a role here.But I have taken note of your proposal and will check this question again.Ms. Roth-Behrendt asked about the positive list.We will deal with this topic in the appendix to the legal regulation.It is intended to set up a positive list for feed.There is currently a negative list, so to speak, that is completed if necessary.The establishment of the positive list is one of the measures for which an appointment is mentioned in the appendix, and this will be in 2002.The quick warning system for feed is one of the points that, in our opinion, represent a weak point in food law.There is a quick warning system for food, but not for feed.It's a shame, and that's wrong.Regulations must be made to close this gap, and that will also happen.	de
"In other words: a decisive leap in development policy is needed, if we do not want rich countries, including the member countries of the European Union, build bulwarks around them to prevent massive immigration.In the global village, the great differences in the world will no longer be tolerated on its poorest part.At one point there will be a revolt and will be absolutely justified.I therefore invite the Prime Minister to start the announced debate as soon as possible and above all to conclude it, so that we can also realize us, also we European citizens, of the implications of globalization, and so that we understand that a central element will consist of radical changes in the field of development;As for our development aid and its level, we are far from 0.7% on average in the European Union that had been promised.It is possible that others do worse than us, but this certainly does not help us.But above all we must give countries the opportunity to trade with us.As far as I heard - however, it is possible that he lost something - the word trade was not even mentioned in the speech of the Prime Minister.To the Commissioner, I would like to simply say that I hope that his proposal can pass to the Commission and the Member States, and I would also like to ask the Commissioner to provide some concrete examples of sectoral interests that make up blocking elements, not only to the Commission, but also in the Member States.Furthermore, I would like to say that in my opinion, the most effective thing would be that Parliament required a proposal to the ""Development"" Council respectively and the Commissioner for Development;In this way we would perhaps have a starting point on which to discuss, instead of requesting a proposal from all governments and the whole commission, because something good would hardly come out.I will conclude with a few notes to the Internet revolution.As commissioner Liikanen is saying, in Europe we have a certain advantage in the mobile telephony sector.Let's use it, not only in favor of our populations, but also in favor of developing countries.This technique allows the necessary decisive leap, and in this case, the European Union can establish the agenda, can influence development and prove to be at the height of its global responsibility.Mr. President, to mention the title of a newspaper article that appeared last week on the issue of the policy of the development of the Union, I will say that ""the cooperation of the development of the European Union is in a miserable state"".There is nothing new in this statement.Ever since we have tried to progress cooperation for development, effectiveness and quality of our efforts in Europe, they are doubtful.There is the danger that the distrust on the possibilities of improvement spreads, given that the commission continues to refuse to look in the mirror.Why has the critical relationship on the consistency of development policy not externally spread?An important conclusion which came that relationship concerned the internal contradictions of European politics."	it
"But I also believe that in the future it will be necessary to configure a properly attractive universal service.We have to define it in a precise way, provide it with a catalog of services and take it to public tender.In the interior of the country, where we are reasonable suspicion that the service will not be profitable or to cover costs, they should, in my opinion, establish the services through a regulation that guarantees fair and appropriate bidding conditions, so that all market forces and also, naturally, the existing postal service can attend it following the strategy of offering the user a varied range of quality services.I think we must prevent more subsidies from finding and, instead, we concentrate on both the private and user are favored by the new system.Mr. President, Lord Commissioner, Ladies, postal services, such as any European public service, contribute to the social cohesion of the community territory, according to the terms of article 16 of the Amsterdam Treaty.By guaranteeing an equitable distribution of rates, that is, a strict equality of citizens and economic actors against the cost of the service, by assuming the obligations of the universal service and when adapting to a requirement of quality of services, postal services are part of our concern to promote the equality of the territories and of the people who live in them.Postal services also constitute a powerful, negligible element of civic ties.Indeed, as it has been remembered many times in this Assembly, the email employee is not the last contact in the territorial areas that are called ""deserted"" or ""fractured"", it is either in isolated geographical areas, or of sensitive outslets of our cities?I will cite as an example the initiative of the administration of French postal services, which is prepared to guarantee, among other services, the presence of interpreters and public notaries in the Post Offices of the sensitive urban areas.Not to mention the jobs that this represents, the European Public Postal Services Administrations today use a million and a half agents, which can be clearly threatened by the spectrum of a brutal and not controlled liberalization.The European Parliament has pledged to reconcile opening to the competition with a universal service obligation of employment.We can congratulate ourselves for it, but we will ensure that this path is continued, and for this reason we can not deplore that the European Parliament is maintained today outside the decision -making process that presides over the future of the postal sector in Europe.It is unfortunate, in effect, that until now - as this resolution underlines it - the Commission has not taken into account the resolution of January 14, 1999. This required, as it should be remembered, that the European Parliament was associated with the elaboration of the planned measures and that the reliability of the studies of the effects on liberalization was strengthened.These studies on the effects are necessary to evaluate the consequences that any wild liberalization would have not only for the economic organization of the market, but also for its human and social dimension."	es
We therefore agree with the relationship, as we agree, Mr. Commissioner, with the underlying principles of the White Paper.Community law on competition represented, since the entry into force of the Treaty, one of the fundamental chapters of Community policy.Well, about forty years after their entry into force, those provisions began to manifest signs of failure.It was therefore necessary to urgently proceed with a modernization, and this particularly in five areas.First, the system for the release of authorizations;secondly, decentralization in the application of the provisions;thirdly, the procedural rules;Fourth, the application of those provisions in justice;and, in fifth and last place, excessive formalism.The system for the release of individual authorizations required an urgent reform, as required by unison from companies, experts on the subject and specialist lawyers.I have never witnessed an assembly of competition law specialists in which a change of the system was not requested.A system capable of offering such a small number of decisions, both of authorization and prohibition, such as the one in force today can be considered everything except a valid system.For some time, the national authorities responsible for the competition had the right to apply articles 81, paragraph 1, and 82From as many German courts, in which the national judge applies whether it is possible to apply article 81, paragraph 1, without being able to use paragraph 3 of the same article.A reform was therefore necessary on this aspect.The procedure to be followed on competition is substantially contained in Regulation n.1762.The voices of those who asked for the modification were unanimous.This unanimity in requiring its reform was motivated by the fact that that regulation did not define a real procedure, which did not establish terms of time, did not regulate access to the employment by the interested parties and did not adequately recognize the rights of the defense.The Court of Justice has recognized, for some time, that the Community law regarding competition could be applied by the National Judge, and the Commission already published a communication in the matter in 1994.It was therefore necessary to facilitate the practicability of this street.One of the criticisms made greater frequency to the Community law of competition concerns its excessive formalism.As a consequence of the continental legal tradition, the definition of a given agreement as opposite or not to the competition depends more on the analysis of its clauses than on its effects on the market.It was therefore necessary to introduce the concept of economic analysis.The White Paper aims to solve all these problems and, therefore, we support the proposals.It is true that there have not been some deficiencies, on which the relationship focuses.In the first place, the fact that, despite addressing the issue of the modernization of articles 81 and 82, importance was attributed only to article 81, and not in article 82. In the current phase, in which the concentration processes of companies or privatization of monopolies have left the dominant positions intact, when they have not even strengthened, pursuing the abuse of the dominant position in court acquires particular importance.Secondly, Regulation n.1762 must be repealed and replaced by a new regulation.In these terms, we intend to support the report.	it
It is she who is competent in terms of technical security against false coinage.As we have already pointed out, the Commission presented in the summer of 1998 a communication drawing up the list of all areas where measures are required, namely the field of information, the field of permanent training -an important point -, the field of cooperation between the states of the euro zone and of naturally cooperation beyond this simple framework and in the field of criminal measures.This is what it is in the framework decision subject to your exam.Madam Rapporteur, I would like to thank you very sincerely on behalf of the Commission and, before anything else, I also thank Parliament for having been able to develop an opinion in such a short time.I attach a Grand Prix to it.In the framework decision, it is a question of ensuring that the member states use the definition of false coinage crimes.Having the same definitions is obviously the essential condition for reacting in the same way everywhere, because, as we have already pointed out, it is essentially to ensure that the euro will be protected even before being physically put into circulation.Of course, the Commission is also grateful to Parliament for having made its decision quickly -I hope that the text will be adopted just as quickly -which now allows the entry into force of the framework decision as soon as possible.As a result, implementation measures may be incurred.The Commission is now invited to present, during the first half of next year, a report on the implementation of the framework decision in the Member States, so that the importance of the subject is reflected in adequate actions.It has been noted that this framework decision is precisely criminal law.It is therefore advisable to recognize this innovation, this advance, even if Mr. Schulz pointed out that by completing this fairly old convention, the advance of which is rather timid.To the question asked whether the Commission is of the opinion that the framework decision is based on a legal basis sufficiently solid in accordance with the Treaty, the Commission is of the opinion that the applied legal basis is the right one.However, the framework decision must then be supplemented by other laws of law.The Commission will propose a proposal for the cooperation of all the competent authorities and on cooperation with Europol.This proposal must provide for a duty of cooperation and must also force the national authorities to report the cases of counterfeiting to Europol and to subject the counterfeit money to the ECB for identification and classification, which will make it possible to take effective measures in this area.As for the question of coordinating the various measures, since 1998, the Commission - and subsequently the OLAF - has worked with the experts of the Member States, the BCE and Europol, in order, in advance, effectively fight against the counterfeiting of euros.For its part, the Commission has already presented - as noted Mr. Karas - a campaign proposal on the Euro whose proposed budget is still rising to 32 million euros.This is an amount that can be spent in a judicious manner, a substantial amount.This campaign will of course focus on the security of the euro in the face of the false coinage.	fr
Consequently, any proposal suggesting a major reform of the system for applying the competition policy must be carefully examined.The truth is that the single market is not yet completed.During the six months that I spent as a deputy within this parliament, I became fully aware of the determination of many deputies to promote what is called the European project.We intend to say daily that we must promote a broader and deeper Europe.However, in reality, all this is from rhetoric in view of national, regional and local obstacles which continue to hinder the functioning of a real European single market.It is in this context that I want to assess the commission's proposals.I would like to say clearly that we grant the greatest confidence to Commissioner Monti and that we respect him deeply.We consider that he is the appropriate man to dismantle the cartels.However, he must recognize, like everyone else, that his specific proposals should be assessed and subject them to a rigorous examination, a work accomplished by our rapporteur of the Economic and Monetary Commission, Mr. Von Wogau.I would like to congratulate him, in his absence unfortunately, for the exhaustive and meticulous way in which he undertook the preparation of his report - as well as for having supported me, as a source of constant irritation!He mentioned earlier the fact that the report was adopted by a large majority but without my support.Although I do not share his conclusions, I believe that he illustrated, in his report, a large number of questions that the commission must take care of.First, the possibility of renationalization of competition policy.I know that the Commission is not favorable there but the possibility exists.I remain worried about the capacity of the jurisdictions and national competitions in matters of competition.I remain worried about the entire operation concerning the judicial process.I asked Commissioner Monti a few days ago what would happen if he was wrong and that a renationalization really took place.Mr. Von Wogau declares that we can turn to the European Court.Well, in Great Britain, that's what we are doing for the moment.We see that the European Court is not able to set provisional measures with regard to a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment, for which we have the support of the European Commission.Unless it is estimated that this constitutes a purely nationalist argument, the European Court took ten years to render a judgment with regard to the Factortame affair, in which the British government was the defendant.So, from a judicial point of view, measures should be taken.I ask the Commission what can be undertaken to accelerate the implementation in this particular area.As for legal certainty, I approve of the argument put forward by Ms. Thyssen.It is important that companies enjoy legal certainty.I said it again to Mr. Monti recently.He said we shouldn't always have lawyers.	fr
"Finally, it should be remembered that the real solution of the comitology problems for the European Parliament in any case and in principle in the change in the procedure provided for the implementation of the regulations and the gradual abolition of the committees, the existence of which is an abnormality, by which the authority authority of the Commission is severely restricted and the legislative law of the European Parliament can be impaired.President, dear colleagues!Comitology is a term with which most people cannot do anything, and very few people know what is meant by it.It is reminiscent of secret and conspiracies, and so it was earlier.However, there is nothing else behind it than the determination of the modalities for the exercise of the implementation powers assigned to the Commission.The modalities of these implementation powers consist of a limited number of committee proceedings.Until the Treaty of Amsterdam, there were around 20 variations of this committee procedure, which did not contribute to the clarity of the legislation or for transparency for the citizens.On the contrary, even the European Parliament was not even informed for a long time.The first progress in the fight for more transparency in this committee jungle was for the European Parliament in being informed at least about what the European Commission intends to regulate in the context of these various committees.This was done in 1988 as part of the correspondence in Plumb/Delor.Another step towards transparency and participation of the European Parliament was the so -called Vivendi mode on September 20, 1994, in which not only the information was granted to the parliament, but also a certain way of objection.The parliament also received control options.With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation has improved significantly in that the number of committee proceedings - as the European Parliament had long demanded - was drastically limited to three procedures, namely the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure.The information and control rights granted to the European Parliament in the past must now be again stipulated by an interinstitutional agreement according to Amsterdam's contract.Our rapporteur, Ms. Frassoni, has done a very careful work and showed which questions are clarified within the framework of this interinstitutional agreement and which administrative procedures within the parliament may have to be changed.A main problem is the time factor.If the European Parliament is informed, it usually has to comment within a very short period of four weeks if it wishes.In the event of questions that affect the health and security of people in the European Union, the European Commission must be able to react very shortly, if necessary, within a few hours or days, as a guardian of the contracts and the only institution that is entitled to initiative rights.Nevertheless, the law of the European Parliament must remain preserved on information and, if necessary, reaction.For these difficulties, our rapporteur shows very useful solutions that I can only fully support with my faction.I only have one request.In the German text of section 2, a little misleaded, and I urgently ask for clarification, even afterwards by those who are responsible for the pressure.Instead of ""must be continued"" in my opinion, ""must be preserved"" should be called."	de
This proposal is in stark contrast to the current system, in which criminal law and criminal proceedings as the heart of the national legal systems fall under the sovereignty of every people and the exclusive jurisdiction of each state.In contrast, the idea of ​​a European public prosecutor's office aims to push the states into a subordinate role in the long term.In addition, this slope would result in an absolutely unpredictable chain of reforms.According to the Theato report, the European public prosecutor's office would primarily be necessary to guide the investigations of the Olaf Office for Fraud Control.At the same time, however, the report from Van Hulten, who is advised today, can be learned that the European public prosecutor in turn should be monitored by a court of the European Union.This can hide a large reform behind a small European reform and a medium reform.Apart from the fact that a huge reform can be hidden behind the large reform, because soon you will be a European criminal law and why not then propose a European Minister of Justice that would be controlled by an expansion of the powers of the European Parliament.In my opinion, you should think well about the power weight that could be disturbed if one suggests such an apparently punctual reform.Ultimately, it becomes clear that suggestions such as the inability for a European public prosecutor reveal the inability to Europe differently than pyramidal and centralized, i.h.to present in the form of a super state.In contrast, the Group of Europe of the Nations is aiming for a Europe that is poly -centered and in which the nations are networked.As a result of such networking, for example, a better coordination between the national courts and possibly the formation of national structures that specialize in violations of the damage to community finances would be conceivable.The legal framework already exists.It is in order in principle and should only be perfected.President, Ms. Theato, suggests an institutional revolution for two reasons.The public, the 20 million unemployed and thousands of cows affected by the beef madness indifferent, should be worried due to the fraud that allegedly endangering financial interests.And these two reasons should justify a double instrument: a European Criminal Code for violations of community law and a European Attorney General.Ms. Theato probably forgot to mention a European prison because the FBI, the European police, already exists with Olaf.The whole should be regulated by two regulations, one for the prosecutor, one for the criminal code that is to be passed on the basis of Article 280 of the contract, i.e.h.According to the derived right, because one of the special features of the derived right is that it allows all the absurdities.We are dealing with a double absence.First of all, there is the classic, euro -fermentation ideological absurdity: a uniform market, a uniform VAT, uniform diplomacy, a uniform army and now a uniform criminal law and a uniform public prosecutor.And all of this to fight frauds that make up less than a billion, while the APS, the free trade zones or customs gifts on Chiquita are thrown out of the window many times over and, as a result of the household rationing package, another billions from the fourth source of income, GDP, are lost.	de
And it could go on like this.Mrs. Commissioner, since the time available is short, I would like to quickly list the seven points, she has mentioned some, which seem essential to us and on which to work: the obligation, as soon as possible, to navigate in our waters, of the double hull;the most severe possible control by the landing state.In addition, classification companies must be obliged to make their relationships public because they are not made known.Harmonization of sanctions between the fifteen Member States so that they must not differ but be equal everywhere.Greater severity for convenient flags, not because the ships that beat these flags necessarily are bad ships but because many bad ships use these flags;Improve the information on the set of world fleets but this is already expected;define and make responsibilities heavier.In this regard, I would like to know who the owner of Erika is because the notion of legal person in our right is one thing but there are always shareholders behind, natural persons;Where are the owners of Erika?Perhaps in beautiful villas, on beautiful beaches to tan in the sun.We would like to know their names and faces.Finally, the improvement of crew formation.There is no zero risk in our society but at least you have to take maximum precautions.Mr. President, I appreciated the declaration of Mrs. Commissioner.I have been to the sea for a long time and therefore in experience I know the power and destructive power well that make the correct design and maintenance of ships and boats a fundamental factor.I would like to express my solidarity to all those who are dealing with the consequences caused by the split in two sections and by the sinking of the Erika oil tanker.It was an environmental disaster and also a deplorable waste of resources.I remember that the oil industry, through the International compensation Fund for pollution from hydrocarbons (fippol), pursuant to the 1969 convention and the 1992 protocol, assumes responsibility for over 90 percent of the estimated costs of the accident, that is, about 170 million dollars.This leads me to believe that we should think of a partial assumption of responsibility also by shipowners, the flag state and the inspection authorities.However, before launching us precipitously in a new regulatory impetus, we carefully examine the provisions in force to be sure that they are applied correctly: better to respond to the request to amend and improve existing legislation rather than embark on new proposals.In this sense, they are in favor of requests intended to strengthen the controls of the landing status to guarantee complete and effective inspections, as well as requests aimed at ensuring that classification companies actually verify the structural conditions of the ships and are held responsible for their actions.The request to improve the design in the construction of the hull, especially of double hull ships is reasonable but takes time to be applied to the whole fleet.	it
The great displacement campaign of the Serbs could be stopped, but almost every day there are unacceptable incidents where people are killed where people are prevented from living there and living as they want.Every day there are attacks on Serbs, Roma, on Bosnier, but there are still attacks on Albanians.The report actually made me startled when he is true that an Albanian doctor who certainly worked in the Hospital in Mitrovic in the Serbian part ultimately gave it up to be there for his population in this hospital because his life was repeatedly threatened.These are incidents and situations that we cannot tolerate.I hear - whether it is true or not, I don't know - that the Serbs still operate a mine in Kosovo, in the Serbian part.There are at least rumors that Serbian militias are still active.For me it is irrelevant whether it is a Serb, a Roma, a Bosnian or an Albanian who is threatened or killed in Kosovo.For me it is irrelevant who is working towards a division and separation in Kosovo.It is crucial for me that the organs we finance achieve what we want to achieve, namely a multi -ethnic Kosovo, a coexistence in Kosovo.We need more police, there is absolutely not enough police.We need an independent judiciary - certainly difficult to build - we also need funds for the high commissioner for human rights.All of this has to happen, and quickly.If we do not help quickly, the situation deteriorates and there may be new conflicts and crisis situations.So I think it is correct that we acted quickly, that we have given urgency that we provide the money.Only, we want to see the actions, and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I ask the Commission to make sure that this money is also used successfully, in particular to expand the police and to build the judiciary.President!First of all, many thanks to the ladies and men and especially the rapporteur for the speed you dealt with this topic.This will undoubtedly enable us to quickly instruct funds for Kosovo and to counteract the concerns that both Mr. Swoboda and Ms. Pack have expressed.In the pronunciation tonight, I think I can see three types of main worries.First: Although we have progressed far, we could mention customs administration, bank management, tax administration, it is true that we have to go forward further.Forward to finance what?Here we have a first little disagreement.In some of their amendments, they require that the type of facilities are being tightered to which the Union's financing contribution refers.For example in amendments 3 and 5. But after our perception, in both aspects of the administration of the United Nations, which knows the reality better than we do, a greater scope of maneuver should be left.We believe that the intended determination of the resources at the moment would create more practical difficulties.	de
"One should not forget that in 1999 there were 717,000 that came to compensate for our low birth rate.Therefore, an immigration policy with social consciousness is essential in the social order, as President Gutierres recently explained in Spain.It is necessary to take special consideration of the situation of those who are threatened or weakened in terms of economic changes, mergers, mergers, takeovers, new technologies, etc.Here, an educational policy for the ability and preparation for new jobs is imperative to secure existing employment or to have a second chance, because sometimes the postman rings twice, as the film title says.I just believe that it is the responsibility of all European, national and regional governments to ensure that it rings several times.I mean, Ms. Commissioner, that the Commission is responsible for promoting and coordinating these opportunities.Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Andersson on his really excellent work - that's why there is also extensive agreement - and thank the ladies and men for their contributions.Let me make some remarks about the explanations that have already been heard.First, I would like to emphasize that the debate about social protection between the European organs was admitted a few years ago.In 1995 there was a first message entitled: ""The Future of Social Protection"", reports of the European Parliament, by Ms. Weiler and Mr. Pronk.Today we treat Mr. Andersson's report.In my opinion, we have made a lot of progress, especially since we are already debating on the modernization of social protection.Second, it is important to take into account the legal basis on which the European Commission can work.As is well known, the contract does not result in a legal basis for politics at European level, but there is also an agreement, which is also confirmed at the last council, that measures to coordinate and exchange experiences and successful programs should be initiated among the Member States.Third, I point out that the four goals that the present report focuses on, namely the paid work, the economic sustainability of the pension systems, social integration, and finally the quality of health care, a horizontal approach is pursued with regard to equality issues, because as part of the categories mentioned by women and men, there are special programs tailored to women.It is often necessary to tackle the problems with special policies.Next I would like to take into account the specific steps that we have initiated.As is well known, a high -ranking working group was already used by the Portuguese presidency, which will present their first report at the summit in June.The Portuguese presidency will primarily deal with the two questions in the long term safe pension systems and social integration.In my opinion, the proposal to set up a corresponding contact group at parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute to the fact that after this high -ranking working group has been approved.Several speakers have commented on the role of social protection systems, the costs of social protection and the influence of these systems on the competitiveness of the Member States.I would like to say that with the help of the political attempts to link competitiveness and social cohesion in Europe."	de
Current and urgency debate in accordance with the agenda, the debate on today's, urgency and special importance problems is carried out.Racist and xenophobic incidents in the ejido (Spain) In accordance with the agenda, the following resolution proposals are carried out: B5-0149/2000 of Mr. Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Popular Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, on the outbreaks of racism and xenophobia in the region of El Ejido (Spain);B5-0159/2000 of Messrs. Gasòliba I Böhm and Sánchez García, on behalf of the European Liberal, Democrats and Reformist Group on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain);B5-0162/2000 of Mrs. Díez González and others, in the name of the group of European socialists, about the racist and xenophobic explosion in the ejido (Almería);B5-0169/2000 of Mr. Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European Left European/Left Nordic Green, on the xenophobic outbreak in the ejido (Spain);B5-0175/2000 of Mr. Bautista Ojeda and others, on behalf of the Green Group/European Free Alliance, on the Xenophobic incidents in the ejido (Spain).Mr. President, this debate reassures me because I see that the first three intervening we know the situation well because we are of African origin.In the first place, I would like to congratulate the groups of this assembly for the high degree of consensus achieved in this resolution, aware as I am of the effort that the deputies of this Parliament have done to avoid using an issue like this for electoral purposes.Secondly, I would also like to affirm with full conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia are xenophobes or racist, which does not naturally exclude the most absolute condemnation of the use of violence by those who, individually or in groups, only deserve that the law and only the law pursue them rigorously and firmly.We agree that we face the question of immigration with depth and rigorously.The facts, which unfortunately go ahead of political decisions in this field, confirm without a doubt the priority of development without delay of the Tampere agreements and the Title IV of the Treaty.Today's problems cannot be solved within five years.It is a long time, as we are checking.The legislation of the Member States must adapt to the agreements of the governments in Tampere, as the resolution itself says in its section 7. The social integration of legal immigrants must be carried out without any excuse and without any delay.On the other hand, Mr. President, Ladies, the labor market must be ordered with realism so that the jobs covered by citizens of third countries are subject to the labor regulations that protect wages, social security and social coverage in the plane of equality, thus eradicating the labor exploitation and the bags of marginalized citizens that give rise to the facts that condemns the resolution and that, ultimately, are the real background of the social problem.raised.They are fundamental, on the other hand, solidarity, dialogue and agreements between institutions - also national, regional and local with entrepreneurs, unions and immigrant communities themselves, whose countries of origin also have undoubted responsibility.	es
As part of the next resolution of the CIG, Parliament will have to seriously study the question of differentiation and flexibility.Both the enlargement and the results of integration are threatened if we are unable to create the concentric circles system proposed by the Liberal group.My colleagues, Ms. Frassoni and Mr. Onesta, have already expressed themselves, not without a certain skepticism, on certain aspects of the question that occupies us.I would like to share my concerns about subsidiarity, not only between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Member States and their own autonomous regions.This subject has not received adequate attention and many elements are a source of concern.Allow me to draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement for this parliament.It was decided that Parliament could not reasonably have more than 700 deputies if we wanted it to remain a deliberative assembly.If we apply the current principle of decreasing proportionality, namely 6 seats per member member plus a siege per half-million inhabitants, we already come to a situation where Luxembourg, with its 367,000 inhabitants, has more deputies in this assembly than the country of Galle, which is a partially autonomous United Kingdom region.Scotland, with a population of 5 million inhabitants, currently has 8 seats in this assembly, Denmark and Finland have 16, for the same number of inhabitants.However, what will happen if we maintain the maximum number of deputies in the European Parliament at 700, if we gradually include 26 % more population, and if we then adopt the commission proposal - which I consider little thought - to know that we should have a European list of candidates.What will happen to a region like Scotland, which I represent here?She will become completely invisible!In these circumstances, the deputies of this assembly should not be surprised in the least that the inhabitants of Scotland and other similar countries require, in these discussions, if the enlargement should not consist in the admission of new member states from existing states.This opinion is increasingly widespread in Scotland.Mr. President, if I say that the Union is at a crossroads, I will not be announced anything new.It has been said many times.But this time, it is true: we have launched the single currency extremely positive and we are considering an enlargement.It remains to be seen whether we will be ready at the time of widening or not.Are we going to expand without deepening or will we widen in deepening?This is the debate and this is to what will all discussion on the intergovernmental conference, its agenda and its method will tend to.It is obvious that, for the time being, the Council has not bet on an enlargement accompanied by a deepening.This is dangerous for enlargement, dangerous for any perspective of political union and, above all, difficult to understand for public opinion.The Council must understand that if we want the future of the European Union to go through a solid enlargement, the next intergovernmental conference must go much further.	fr
You postponed article 11, paragraph 1, which stipulates that the allocations of funds cannot replace the expenses for public or similar structural purposes to the Member State.Very well: this is the immutable rule.Could article 11, paragraph 1 authorize the following practice?We place that the financing of an autonomous region or a country by way of structural funds increases, then the State could proportionally reduce the central funding intended for the Region in question, so that the total package of available loans corresponds to a formula set at national level, regardless of the amount of the structural funds provided by the Union.Is such a practice really allowed?Additionality is also an important theme for Wales, which I represent.Last week this theme was even one of the reasons that led to a vote of distrust and the resignation of the first secretary of the National Wales Assembly.Only in 1991-1992 did the Commission have won a battle with the United Kingdom on additionality, at the time in the context of Rechar funds.This led to the signing of an agreement in which the British government agrees to introduce procedures to ensure that community funds arrived in the areas to which they had been intended and were really additional.Despite this, the problems persist in Wales and Scotland.Could the Commission examine this particular situation in relation to the agreement signed with the British government?I therefore deduce, honorable deputy, that the debate that results in it is underway in Scotland also takes place in Wales.I will verify what he tells me and if he is in agreement, I will also answer his question in writing, as I promised the honorable Maccormick.I will try, Mr. President, to give a short response by telling the honorable deputy that the regional development plan presented by the Spanish authorities on 29 October does not allow me to conclude that there was a distribution of community resources between the Spanish regions of the objective 1 - because it is of this that it is for Andalusia - and therefore those intended for the region represented by her.You know, honorable deputy, who since I could not understand well how things were, on December 14th I wrote a letter, which I have here with me, to the Minister of Economy and Finance Rato, to ask for complementary information on the document presented.In the coming weeks, the Commission will start negotiations with the Spanish authorities to process the community support framework for the new period 2000-2006 and during these meetings I assure you that the Commission will get the necessary clarifications on the region by region.Speaking of Andalusia, if you want as soon as I have the data by sector and region, I will hurry to communicate them personally.Mr. Commissioner, the problem is that when Aznar has to collect funds from the European Union for Andalusia, the Andalusian counts them all, but when Aznar has to pay the Andalusian junta in the form of services for all Andalusian, he no longer sees 400,000 Andalusi and is very serious because 400,000 children are like the whole population of Strasbourg or as a larger city of Granada, full of children.	it
The text of the proposal for the regulation has been changed relatively significantly in the fishing committee.All members of our faction voted for these amendments in the committee as well as in the plenary.The text becomes considerably clearer through change application 1.The recorded data is not only intended for scientific purposes.They must be processed by the scientists and then forwarded to the political bodies commissioned with the decision.However, it is of the greatest importance that the recording is scientifically justified.Amendment 2 includes a change in the original commission proposal.The commission's proposal requires the development of very detailed studies for each individual ship and every single company.In addition to the extraordinary cost loads that such a proposal entails, the cumbersome implementation procedures could also cause certain administrations to take these difficulties into an excuse not to make the corresponding information in good time.There is still a risk that additional bureaucratic requirements in this sector will cause the affected people.For the second part of this amendment, it should be said that it is necessary to determine the job losses in this sector much more precisely and to record it in terms of numbers.It should not be forgotten that the implementation of a common fishing policy must also include a social dimension in statistical-analytical terms.Amendment 3 enables the important aspect to be taken into account in recording environmental data.The particularly negative effects of the lack of consideration of such data is e.g.For example, the decision about the ban on driving nets, which is not justified at all, because it is one of the most selective fishing devices.If this ecological dimension is not included in the data collection, the Commission could prohibit the use of this or that fishing device at will.Amendment 4 includes the obligation of the scientists to process all data in this way and to submit the responsible authorities, including the national and regional authorities, that they are helpful for decision -making.The stress contained in the commission proposal is reduced with amendment 5.The responsible authorities may only request information that improve the operational knowledge of fishing activity without demanding that data are disclosed by the right to confidentiality, such as tax information that does not fall within the area of ​​responsibility of the community.Among the commission in the procedure and monitoring of the procedure causes a more binding design of this article.It is necessary that all data is transmitted annually and the Commission regularly informs about the aggregated results.Change application 7 Finally, the Commission obliges to submit a report by the end of 2001.Since the common fishing policy is to be redesigned in 2002, all political managers must have the information that forms the basis of the commission proposal.Hudghton report (A5-0036/2000) The change in the directive submitted by the Commission is important because it deals with a special contagious virus disease, the infectious anemia of salmon.This is transmitted in the water via organic substances such as blood, faeces, mucus, etc.A vertical transmission of the disease by spawning or milk has not been scientifically proven.However, it is known that other species such as trout, eels or herring can carry the virus without developing it.	de
"We therefore believe that a more realistic date should be found in the mediation process.We voted against the amendments 25 and 72, in which a minimal anthropogenic pollution of the entire groundwater is required.We consider this requirement to be unrealistic in view of the immense costs and the extremely long periods for the restoration of an almost unloaded state.This is the reason for our vote decision.Water is a renewable and limited natural resource, the sensible use of which is of essential importance.The framework directive on water policy will represent an important cornerstone of community policy in this sector.The goals of this guideline are clear and ambitious.We agree to these goals.The guideline determines environmental limits close to zero.In our view, however, it would make more sense not to write unrealistic deadlines that neither our states nor our industry can comply with.Of course we need a schedule, but it must be more staggered.The legal obligation to achieve zero emissions and to stop the introductions by 2020 would be a ban on all identified substances.Such provisions could pose major problems with regard to the cross -border catchment areas, and with regard to the accessible countries, they could make the expansion difficult.Of course, I would also like to address a special sector here, the development of which I pursue very precisely, namely agriculture, which is one of the largest water consumers.She has to - and she already begins - accept her role as a paying environmental sinner, but at the same time you also have to take into account her peculiarities and constraints, especially in the dry regions of the world.As far as the change applications regarding the radioactive substances, I am of course for controls, but this question depends on the legal basis regulated in the Euratom contract.Report Andersson (A5-0033/2200) The EDD faction could not support the Anderson report.In the reasoning (page 15), among others.recognized: ""The different levels of development and traditions of the Member States in the area of ​​social security prevent uniform harmonization of social security systems in the Member States"".However, the term ""uniform harmonization"" is one of those confused names that fully disguise the relevant integration process.It is also correct, as it says in the reason that a harmonization is harmful: ""A harmonization would also be harmful, since this would make higher demands on weaker member states and at the same time more socially developed countries could be put under pressure in terms of competitive states.Harmonization - goes out.In point D it is emphasized that ""the Union can ensure added value by accepting real binding and effective convergence criteria"", and in the following it is pointed out in the report that the development of this convergence process is promoted by consulting between the ecoofin council and the Council of Social and Labor Minister.Finally, point 7 emphasizes that ""the social process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious tax coordination"".Here we approach the core of the matter.This project of social harmonization is not a social policy, rather it is a continuation of the EU WWU project."	de
(The session is interrupted at 11.50 a.m. for a solemn meeting on the occasion of the visit of Mr. Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic, and re-accepted at 12.50 p.m.. Voting (continued) according to the agenda follows the coordination of Ms. Stenzel's report on the Equal initiative (A5-0034/2000).(The parliament accepts the motion for resolution.) Recommendation for the second reading: Report (A5-0027/2000) by Ms. Lienemann on behalf of the Committee on Environmental Questions, Popular Health and Consumer Policy regarding the common point of view of the council with regard to the issuance of the guideline of the European Parliament and the Council for creating an administrative framework for measures in the area of ​​water policy(9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067 (COD)) Before the vote: I welcome the quality and ambition of this report on the subject of life.I would like to briefly remind you that Life is a financial instrument in the service of environmental policies within the European Union and in the third countries, both in the neighboring Mediterranean countries as well as in the Baltic Sea residents or in accession countries.The committee for environmental issues, public health and consumer policy has submitted numerous amendments that were largely included in the joint view adopted by the Council.In the third phase of Life (2000-2004), this instrument is divided into three focus areas: Life-Natur (47 %of resources), Life Umwelt (47 %) and Life third countries (6 %).In my opinion, these are the most important changes: the contribution of Life to the sustainable development in the community and to the development of communal policy in the environmental area, in particular with regard to the integration of the environment into the other policies, and the implementation and the revision of the legal provisions in the environmental sector;the improvement of efficiency, transparency and the methodology of the procedures for the implementation of life, the procedures for the information of the citizens and the distribution among the population and the procedures for cooperation between the beneficiaries;The goal of Life: This program is primarily intended to aim at sustainable urban development, in close coordination with the pilot projects realized as part of the Urban initiative, and I already had the opportunity to report on this initiative;The contribution of the funded projects to the sustainability of the socio -economic measures and consequently to the creation of jobs.In my opinion, it is essential that the financial instrument Life continues to enable the accession countries from Central and Eastern Europe.The other accession candidates (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey or Malta) will also be able to take part in Life as soon as appropriate agreements have been concluded with these countries.The main problem in the negotiations with the Council is of course the amount of the total amount, which is intended for the third phase of the Life (2000-2004) program.The Commission's proposal, which was approved by the Council, is 613 million euros, while the committee for environmental issues believes that the corresponding budget would have to include 850 million euros.I support the determined attitude of the rapporteur.The financial equipment in question has not been increased since the introduction of this program, not even when expanding the EU to 15 Member States.If the report in the plenum is passed, a mediation procedure must be initiated, as is intended in the co -decision procedure in order to clarify the question of the funds provided for this program.This type of procedure is common practice, since the programs or legislative projects have too often a household that does not meet the requirements!	de
Until now, the Commission has only experienced a relative success in reimbursement of the funds unjustly collected.Criminal measures are the competence of the Member States.Since at present, these two legal aspects overlap and that the Union budget damage increases on the cross -border level - and are also the result of organized crime -, the distribution of skills between the Member States is not clear.In addition, there are differences between the national legal provisions and requests for legal mutual aid which drag in length or are left unanswered.The Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests of European Communities, signed by the European Council in 1995, and the two protocols relating to it did not change anything.To enter into force, this agreement must be ratified by each of the fifteen Member States.After five years, only four have done so.This inaction, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, led Parliament to call for the creation of a European public prosecutor.In doing so, there is no question of creating a transnational criminal and judicial order.The objective is rather to provide the union with specific instruments aimed at the protection of its financial interests, in compliance with subsidiarity.By this report, we rekindle this idea and initiate the Commission to present legislative proposals to make this objective materialize.In this area, the requests that emerge from the opinions of the Legal Commission and the Internal Market and the Commission for Citizens, Justice and Internal Affairs are fully taken into account.We express two recommendations which arise from the creation of Olaf and should guarantee its operational and legal effectiveness, its transparency and the protection of individual freedoms.To this end, we need - first recommendation - of a legal act which anchors the crimes undermining the financial interests of the Union and the guiding principles.In an amendment proposal, I recommend setting the period at the end of which the Commission will have to advance its proposal to September 30.The second recommendation concerns criminal procedure.The Commission should propose - and, there too, I propose by way of fixing the deadline for May 31, 2000 - a legal act on the creation of an independent organization, linked to the Commission on the institutional level, and responsible for coordinating and controlling the regularity of the OLAF inquiry activities.The existing supervisory committee can only control the independence of the director of the office.Such a proposal should contain an independent status for this organization and define its tasks which are limited to investigations and internal proceedings of OLAF in matters of involvement in the financial interests of the Union as well as to its relations with the national authorities.He remains excluded to influence justice within the Member States.Control of the legality of acts must be provided by the Court of Justice.In addition, we call the next intergovernmental conference to begin the debate on the creation of a European public prosecutor responsible for the protection of the Union's financial interests, if possible on the basis of the now widely recognized study which was produced by renowned specialists, the famous Corpus Juris, as well as feasibility studies that have followed it.	fr
These disasters are actually due to great climate changes to which we are not foreign, because human activities cause them, and in particular those of developed countries.The greenhouse effect and deforestation also involve, in turn, considerable consequences.As regards these regulation on the environmental dimension in the development process of developing countries, the Council has largely followed the amendments that we had presented and voted at first reading.From this point of view, we can only tell us satisfied.However, I want to insist on an aspect that the Council has eluded - inadvertently, at least so I believe and I want to hope -, although it is a fundamental question: the coordination between European actors and local interlocutors, namely the NGOs at the local level, the basic communities and the holders of traditional knowledge in terms of use of biological diversity.No project can be truly effective if it will not be carried out in close cooperation with the population concerned.One last observation: if the creation of the piloting committees will be successful, in my opinion it will be necessary to reaffirm the desire to create a system of appeal open to civil society in developing countries as regards any provision contrary to legitimate concerns in the social sphere.Mr President, the only key capable of opening the doors of the development of developing countries is represented by their direct participation in this process, both as regards the identification of the problems and their resolution.By participating in the first person in the work of development cooperation, I noticed that in recent years this approach has managed, in part, to take the place of the old paternalist ideology, according to which industrialized countries think that the development consists in transferring their living tenor to the most backward nations.The new paradigm of development cooperation underlines the importance of partnership and ability by those who provide the help of knowing how to listen to the other.In fact, it is necessary to be patient and give clients the possibility of identifying their problems by themselves, developing a development plan and completing it.Those who provide help must make sure not to become indispensable and to ensure that work is able to create well -being and activities at the local level.In this regard, honorable Wijkman has produced an excellent relationship, which underlines the importance of this paradigm as a valid and morally sustainable alternative.Unfortunately, at the level of the EU, scientific and technological development projects in favor of developing countries do not follow this approach at all.The framework programs of the European Union do not concern developing countries.In practice, partners cannot participate in scientific and technological environmental development projects, for example, North Africans.Obviously nobody prevents them from carrying out research activities: the problem is that there are no funds.This happens because developing countries cannot participate as a partners in the consortia that require funding.Why?If you think that greater opportunities for participation have been offered to Eastern Europe's countries, it becomes even strangest.In addition, the issues that interest us most closely are, for example, the desertification of northern Africa and the problems that afflict the Mediterranean basin.	it
First, indirect tax provisions;Recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, direct provisions and, in particular, the code of good conduct.This system has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca, time passes and it is necessary to adapt the regulations that we have applied to date to new circumstances.In this regard, I noticed an important consensus in all interventions.First, it is necessary to define clear and complete standards in terms of the development of the regulations.The existence of confused rules, normative voids or rules which only devote indeterminate legal concepts is probably more shocking in this part of the regulations than in others.And this, all the more as is the case in the second part of the reform that is recommended the application of the ordinance to the national authorities.Third, the role that the Commission must play against the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission to guarantee a uniform application by international organizations, seems important to me.Fourth and I will thus finish certain speakers have already referred to it, the international legal order has changed.We noticed it during the aborted conference of Seattle and we see it in our bilateral conferences with various regions or countries of the world.The principle of competition must already be applied universally.And we must ensure that the standards in environmental and work are respected in order to avoid dumping in this sector, so that property rights are scrupulously respected, that state aid is reviewed, because as has been said in this assembly they distort the competition in many sectors and destroy employment within the Union and, finally, so that identical conditions are applied to prevent aidsOther countries do not extend internationally through traps, ultimately.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, the Jonckheer report contains many good ideas on state aid to industry and several other sectors.First of all, it shows the resolution of the Parliament to impose a reduction in state aid in order to ensure the impeccable operation of the domestic market.Among the conclusions, several still arouse serious concerns within our group.For example, the fact that the amounts and the reduced level of public aid vary from one Member State to another prove the usefulness of this kind.Aid resulting from national selfish concerns give companies unjustified advantages, distort competition and lead to a European scale on an ineffective and non -profitable distribution of meager resources.It is no longer the same thing at all, here it is forms of atypical aid.It is necessary to promote the forms of state aid requiring efforts on the part of the beneficiaries.I am thinking in particular of the state guarantees about which the Commission recently took a position.They must obviously be considered as state aid, but in my opinion are a better solution than a direct aid.The competition report highlights the commission's confidence in strict legislation instead of insisting on economic arguments interfereing on competitiveness.	fr
"I believe that there are circumstances where the question of the principles and institutional rules is erased.I encourage the Council and its presidency to continue to defend the fundamental values ​​of the Union.I invite the commission to be less cautious.By this resolution, our parliament takes responsibility.That said, in my eyes, the resolution adopted today is a minimum minimorum, the least we could do.Personally, I defended an even firmer position, and supported amendments 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral amendment proposed by the socialist group.I believe indeed imperative that the Council accepts only technical relations with representatives of the Austrian government where members of the FPö would appear.Associating Jörg Haider's party in a government coalition will trivialize the far right in Europe, and constitutes an extremely serious precedent which could generate important training effects in other members of the Union or in candidate countries.The Austrian Conservative Party takes a historical responsibility there.Our fundamental values ​​are in question here: as a democratically elected representatives by Europeans, we have no choice.We must, our voters demand it, refuse the unacceptable.Because when the spectrum of barbarism resurfaces, ""do not oppose, it is already capitulating"".I abstained during the vote on resolution.I condemn the racist and xenophobic line of Jörg Haider.However, I cannot approve the fact that an EU organ intervene politically in the internal policy of a Member State.That said, I cannot approve paragraph 4 of the common resolution and I cannot vote in favor of the resolution, even against the far right..(SV) It is obvious that European political leaders have the right and the duty to react against Haider and his party.European political leaders have the right to express their opinion on the political evolution of another Member State, as well as a Minister of State can express themselves on racist politicians in a local authority.Finnish experience shows, however, that integration is a better way to combat undemocratic forces than isolation.This is the reason why I voted against point 2 of the resolution.However, this assumes that all parties respect human rights.The ""common reaction"" of the EU presidency in the formation of the government in Austria is legally incorrect.The reaction of the 14 Member States lacks support in the Treaty.Nor should we isolate the forces in Austria who want to work for the defense of human rights.Despite my objection vis-à-vis the way of acting the council and my opinion that it would be better to work for integration rather than isolation, it was essential to clearly show the position of the European Parliament on questions of racism, which is why I voted for the resolution in the final vote.Thus ends the time of votes.Interruption of the session"	fr
Of course, one could also make progress if it succeeded in reaching the government conference on this question.It remains to be seen whether there is a consensus here.Then you will continue to see.We will take note of the suggestions on this topic.Mr President, I agree with the previous speakers and wish Portugal a successful council presidency.You said that this special topic is not on your agenda for the next government conference at the moment, but if this would be desired, you would consider it.Well, I and my 35 colleagues from the British Conservatives in the European Parliament would like to ask.It is clear to me that this is a provocative question.It should also provoke because it is a serious thing: some countries do not respect EU law as they should.We have to find a way to force such countries to comply with the regulations so that we regain the trust of our citizens.I can't imagine a better way to achieve this.Do you have a better suggestion?This is about whether the European dimension is more or less strengthened, especially through their involvement in the contracts.You will understand that this question must be examined at the government conference, and it is one of the topics in which only a special summit of the European Council can authorize the Portuguese chair to pursue it because it is one of the questions that are outside the institutional framework in which the next government conference is carried out.Now government conferences are something of an event, and they can also be something like a Christmas tree.Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that these questions, which have repeatedly arise and have been served by one conference to the next, are brought up again.The problem is whether there is currently a consensus in the European Union to take up this question again, although one must take into account that if such a topic occurs, other, similarly received topics will extend the agenda of the conference.Mr. Dimitrakopoulos has the word for rules of procedure.I ask you to briefly grasp yourself.President!I see that I have to hurry.I really liked what Mr. Seixas da Costa said about Santa Claus.In Spain one speaks of the letter to the three kings.I just want to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent the letter to the three kings with its reports.Now it is at the presidency and the advice to bring gifts requested in our letter to the three kings.As I suspected, it was, strictly speaking, no question about the rules of procedure, but a conclusion of the pronunciation.We thank Mr. Seixas da Costa, but he too can write a letter to the three kings.I just want to say that this question of the Christmas customs that the Lord raised MPs plays an extremely important role.Only that Santa Claus has someone who determines him in this case, and that's why Santa Claus can only give gifts if they are approved by someone else.	de
"However, there is still much to do.The next great challenge is to re -launch the new round of negotiations on world trade, which failed in its attempted takeoff last December in Seattle.It has to be a ""development round"", in which developing countries, which were actually excluded from the previous rounds, are fully represented.Because the best way to reduce poverty in the world is to help developing countries to help themselves.Developing countries want trade, it doesn't help;A small impulse, but not alms.And the best way to help developing countries to help themselves is to open the world markets to allow them to sell their products.In this way, the power of globalization can be used for good, for the benefit of the poor and not only of the rich, the majority and not of a minority.Therefore, either through the ""New Deal"" in Newcastle or of a fair trade in Freetown, the objective of the Labor to give everyone's chance remains the same.Swoboda report (A5-0031/2000).(FR) The will of the commission to strengthen relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslava Republic of Macedonia, and to open to the latter the perspective of a full integration into the community, seemsHe has been indulgent.After having been crushed by the triumphant communism boot, the region continues to pay, since the early nineties, the Soviet sinking bill.However, in this difficult context, and in particular from NATO military intervention in Balkans, some of these states, all authentically European, have proven to have a sense of responsibility, which legitimizes their aspirations for integration into the community.In this sense, the case of the former Yugoslava Republic of Macedonia is both exemplary and emblematic.Exemplary, because it demonstrates that the states of the Balkans are not ravaged by any type of fatality and that, those countries that have the will to do so are now in a position to meet the usual demands of the stabilization and association agreements required by the European Union.Emblematic, because positively illustrates the fifteen project that a common policy must arise to the five countries of the region (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Arym and Albania) capable of converting economic and political stabilization into a living and urgent obligation.The UEN group agrees to send this signal to the former Yugoslava Republic of Macedonia, to the extent that said signal privileges the independence and sovereignty of the states: although in the Balkans it is not possible to find a satisfactory solution without an important cooperation policy between the states that compose them, neither can their integration process be blocked, with the justification that one of its countries would be considered unworthy of this promotion.The Union fulfills its role when searching, through its cooperation policy, an incitement to the nations to embrace with it a basis of common values, whose cornerstone is democracy and freedom of citizens."	es
As representative of the Commission, I will supervise that the paper and the actions that move from it represent the affirmation of a union based on the set of fundamental rights, which are an integral part of the common heritage of Europe.Only in this way can we contribute to rereading the eyes of European citizens, without any exception, the project of an extended union, based on respect for rights and freedoms, on the guarantee of personal security and goods and on the actual legal protection, that is, a union based on the political values ​​that characterize contemporary democracies.I also want to remember that 1999 was the year of the entry according to the 1999-2004 legislature of the European Parliament, the new Commission and, consequently, of the entry in office for a commissioner responsible exclusively of the areas justice and internal affairs.In addition to these events, I would like to remind Parliament some of the subjects approved in 1999. In the immigration, frontiers and asylum area, the Commission presented the proposal for the establishment of the Eurodac database and the proposal for directive on the admission conditions of third countries in the Member States of the Union for the purposes of family reunification - in the context of a precise integration policy for those who stay legally on the territory of the Union.We have examined a communication on common asylum procedures and a recommendation that authorizes the Commission to negotiate with Iceland and Norway an agreement intended to extend to these two countries the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union as a result of the Dublin Convention.The Commission has actively contributed to the work of the high -level group on migration and asylum and in December, finally, presented a proposal for the creation of the European Fund for Refugees.In the context of judicial cooperation, the Commission has presented proposals for regulation that aim to the community of some conventions: one on judicial cooperation and on the execution of the judgments in civil and commercial matters (Brussels-I);Another on the competence, recognition and execution of the judgments in matrimonial matters (Brussels-II) and another still relating to the quote and notification of judicial and extrajudicial acts in civil and commercial matters.We also presented, in 1999, a communication on the victims of crime within the Union, starting a reflection that received a further impulse to tamper and that requires the processing of minimal rules on the protection of the victims of crime, in particular in the field of access to justice and right to compensation for damages, including procedural costs.I would still mention the presentation of the resolution proposal regarding the fight against fraud and falsification to the detriment of the means of payment other than cash.As part of the legislative framework of the Union relating to the fight against financial crime, the Commission presented a proposal for revision of the directive directive of capital.In 1999 we witnessed the entry into function of Europol and the commission, for its part, hoped to sincerely, following what was stated today by the Portuguese presidency, which with the entry into this new phase of the internal and internal business sectors and with the beginning of the reflection on the implementation of the new skills attributed to Europe by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the question of democratic control and the coordination between the European and the judicial bodies is also addressedcompetent, or Eurojust.	it
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four essential principles of the internal market, freedom of service.There is no doubt that the new regulation relating to the provision of cross -border services will improve both the operation of the internal market and the competitiveness and the efficiency of companies.The strict conditions linked to the establishment of the service provision of lifting services - and I support our colleague Wieland on this point - are essential because they avoid crimes such as clandestine emigration and fictitious contracts.Why do I consider this directive so essential?For three reasons: the economic importance of the workforce from third countries within the EU, the competitiveness of companies and the proper functioning of the internal market.So I am delighted, on the one hand, to establish a strict framework and ask, on the other hand, that the controls carried out by the Member States be organized in the most efficient and simplest way.To conclude, I will ask the following question to the Commission, because I am regularly apostrophe on this subject: will the directive harm the membership negotiations?What interpretation do you make of article 1, since it plays an important role for our country located on the border of many new states and in membership negotiations?Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, so far, businessmen should find that two of the important freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, were not applied for them.Indeed, they still had to submit to bureaucratic and endless immigration procedures imposed by the Member States in which a service was to be carried out.About thirteen million nationals from third countries stay on European territory.Although we do not know the exact number of businessmen among them, I start from the principle that their number is certainly not reduced.Until now, their access to the whole territory of the Union was therefore not governed by Community law.The two proposals for a directive directive aim to promote the free movement of services within the internal market through the introduction of the service provision of lifting services.In this regard, it seems important to me to emphasize that the issuance of this service provision will be flexible, namely within five days of a simple notification made to the Member State in which the service will be carried out, and that in addition, this document will benefit from a limited validity period and will not be automatically renewed in order to combat abuse.I also carefully became aware of the reserves advanced by the Commissioner.After examining the amendments introduced, I found that we could largely approve these reservations and we will behave accordingly during the vote of tomorrow.To conclude, allow me to thank Ms. Berger for the great meticulousness with which she examined the various amendments and, in doing so, the important meaning she has given to her report.	fr
We also reject the amendments that intend to include the full cost of water by 2010. Without a doubt, it is necessary to set water prices that encourage efficient use.However, at the same time, they must guarantee the competitiveness of the production sectors in the most disadvantaged regions without hindering its legitimate development.Finally, I would like to formulate an observation on the amendments relating to dangerous substances.These amendments establish that the goal to be achieved is a level of pollution equal to zero, or close to zero.However, I would like to point out that the level of zero pollution of no human activity has not yet been discovered.Ladies deputies, we would make a bad service to the objectives of this important directive if we were not able to attribute it the flexibility and adaptability necessary to guarantee its application.I hope that, once again, Parliament votes demonstrating a sense of reality, respecting the principle of subsidiarity and pursuing a fair balance between environmental objectives and economic and social considerations, the three essential elements to achieve that sustainable development that we all strongly hope.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, I believe that this is an extremely important directive, as his goal is to improve the supply and quality of the waters.Citizens must certainly have the right to have pure water.It is important not only for the environment, but also for the health of the population.I do not speak by personal title, on the contrary, I can say that I am part of that small group of Europeans who can still draw on drinking water directly from the lake in front of the house.Our task is to engage in adopting all necessary measures that can guarantee the improvement of the quality of the water, and this work must start immediately because there is no more time to waste.It is also important to define objectives that they are sufficiently ambitious.In fact, thinking of eliminating the direct discharge of the effluents in the waters and to reduce the amount of impurities and poisonous substances to zero by 2002 is not absolutely ambitious, on the contrary.It is just a matter of doing what is technically possible;neither more nor less.Nonetheless, you must also have ambitions.I would like to return to a point already discussed previously.In my opinion, the Environment Commission has limited too much the question of water transfer.This problem does not only concern Spain, but also the Nordic countries and I really hope that greater space for national solutions, provided they are ecologically and economically better than those provided for by the directive .. Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, congratulations to the honorable Lienemann for the excellent work done!The water and the air surround us everywhere and we share them with all the inhabitants of the planet.Water is an indispensable condition for man's life and human beings in the world are increasingly numerous.Mr Schleicher said, during the day, that it would not be realistic to aim for clean water.Nothing more wrong!What is not realistic is to continue to worsen the quality of the water, continue to worsen the conditions that make life possible.	it
It is an instrument that does not always lead to optimal solutions.The basics of the economy tell us that the market is failing in many ways and anyone who denies such a fact is nothing other than an ideologist.Competition should bring the balance between supply and demand, ensure an optimal distribution of economic resources and facts.However, optimal efficiency does not necessarily flow from source.To avoid abuses, a general framework is essential, for example via the law in terms of agreements.But, for the most part, this only makes it possible to avoid abuses and is not enough, as such, to achieve socially legitimate objectives.Competition: Yes.The limitation of aid: where it is necessary and possible.But, given that the aid occupies most of the 1998 report on competition, I still want to say a few words about this, without prejudice to our colleague Jonckheer.The aid granted to small and medium -sized enterprises in the research and development sector and those aimed at training in regional and environmental policy are undoubtedly possible and must be achievable.As long as they do not lead to unacceptable distortions of competition, aid aimed at such objectives should be authorized.That decisions made in these specific areas can be executed is even more important than it is for the law in matters of agreements and mergers.We should not be content to nail the aids to the pillory: they must be considered in a differentiated manner, they must also be assessed according to what they contribute to achieving the aforementioned objectives.The latter remark was less addressed to the commission than to our colleagues from the PPE group.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, my dear colleagues, the report that I have the opportunity to offer you today is an opinion on the annual report of the Commission concerning the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the community is competent under articles 87, 88 and 89 of the treaties.The Commission's report is an essentially descriptive report which describes the evolution of state aid in the manufacturing sector as well as other sectors, according to different typologies, such as the mode of financing and the objectives pursued.I allow myself to refer to the presentation of the reasons for the quantitative part of the report and I will content myself with indicating here that the annual amount, on average, for the period under review, is around 95 billion euros, which represents a decrease in the order of 13 % compared to the period 1993-1995, decrease which, essentially, is due to a decrease in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany.Clearly, the level of declared state aid is, roughly, stable on average during the period covered and is around 1.2 % of community GDP, it is a coincidence, more or less the equivalent of the community's budget for a year.	fr
What happens if more women actively and equally take part in the political decision?From the previous development it can be said that the agenda has changed - and if the agenda changes, the type of decisions will of course also change.If there is talk of odds, then the word competence is always mentioned.It is interesting, however, that the competence requirements are rarely defined.Instead, it often looks as if the men always have the highest, non -defined competence, just as before.It would be the most competent to be a man.I consider this view as evidence of the great incompetence among many decision -makers from the present.At the beginning of this year we made the demand in this plenary to declare March 8 for an international holiday.In anticipation of a positive decision of this question, I would now like to take the opportunity to wish all social democratic women every success with the Women 's World Marches, which will start in spring on international women's day.This global action wants to put violence against women and the poverty of women around the world into the focus of attention.Finally, I would like to underline what Commissioner Patten said at the end of the previous debate: The ideal policeman would be a black grandmother.We don't have that yet, but they exist!Mr. President, the position of women in politics is an important question that deserves more attention than this politically correct mutual that we are now experiencing.Undoubtedly, too few women are involved in politics.This is certainly not just due to the men's dominance in the party apparatus.In France, 95 % of MP local politicians are.Most of them do not belong to any party.In the leading bodies at department level, the non -partisan MPs, other rights or other leftists, represent the largest group. In order to be elected as local politicians, one only has to run.Access to national responsibilities often depends on the influences that open such mandates.Our faction is committed to equal representation of men and women in the organs of the European Union.That is why we are against quota policy and the positive discrimination, be it in favor of women or so -called social minorities.The minority policy, which makes superficial divisions under disregarding the deep unity of the human community, threatens the cohesion of the social structure and the balance of our democratic model.On the one hand, when we set up women's quotas, why not quotas after age or co -affiliation, odds for Catholics, workers, glasses wearers.The introduction of social quotas in favor of the lowest income categories would also not be more brain -tear than the creation of women's quotas.With such a philosophy, no elections or job advertisements in the administration were no longer needed.It would be sufficient to statistically calculate the composition of the ministries and parliaments.The quota policy would only increase the disenchantment with politics of voters by once again giving them the feeling that everything happens behind their back.On the other hand, such a policy is a sign of deep contempt towards women.	de
Investments and goals must be invested in the environment in the environmental sector.The future of future generations depends on it.Mr. President, Ms. Commissioner, I will undoubtedly repeat what my colleagues have already said, but I think the advice has to be told again and again what we think of life.So I will also emphasize - as the rapporteur has already done correctly - that Life is the only specific financial instrument for the development and implementation of the environmental policy of the European Union.This instrument is of fundamental importance, because there is an impetus for really new measures in favor of nature and the environment in Europe, which are then taken up and expanded by the Member States.It is also deliberately democratically designed because it is equally open to government and non-governmental organizations.For this reason, I am asking them to vote for the amendments that in no way correspond to the spirit of Life.In fact, Life can be used directly by the European citizen for measures through the associations.For several million - I underline: Millions - Members of NRO, the Union will be visible in Life to carry out an ambitious policy in favor of the natural environment.Life is also the basic instrument for the Natura 2000 network in Europe, for which the Member States in accordance with the community directive to preserve natural habitats as well as the wild animals and plants and the migratory bird directive are committed and which enables the protection of biologically valuable areas in our states.I would like to add that those who make this policy in their states are responsible for the fact that nature conservation policy is slowed down in Europe.This is unfortunate, because everyone in this hall knows that the financial instrument Life is not sufficient to realize all projects submitted by the Member States, many of which have to be rejected due to a lack of means.It should not be forgotten that Life is currently only equipped with 100 million euros per year, which does not even make up 1 per thousand of the Union budget.For comparison - for agriculture that has real effects on the environment, as we all know - 37 billion euros are spent.In view of this, my faction is of the opinion that the center equipment of Life must be increased, and supports the proposal of Ms. Lienemann to increase the budget to 850 million euros, because we know - you simply have to say - how high the expectations of our fellow citizens in the environmental area are and how half -hearted and unacceptable the compromise of the Council is, because the Life is moreLife programs have exceptionally high execution rates and have made an effective contribution to the development of new environmental practices.This undoubtedly also includes the first sustainable development projects.Mr. President, the environmental program of the European Union, equipped with considerable means (613 million euros), raises numerous questions regarding the proper use of public funds.A financial instrument of this extent must be transparent and efficient, which for the following reasons is not the case: poor criteria, dubious and unauthorized projects, no publication of balance sheets, the lack of evaluation measures.	de
"For the purpose of facilitating the realization of this objective, Directive 96/35/EC has planned to designate consultants for the safety of dangerous goods transport those who have appropriate professional training.The objective of this professional training for consultants was to be the knowledge of the legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions applicable to these transport.If at the time this constituted progress, the absence of specific provisions on the harmonization of the examination conditions proved to be problematic.Therefore it was considered indispensable to fill this gap to reach a high and uniform level of training of safety consultants and avoid disparities between training costs, which consequently would have influenced the competition between companies of the Member States.The Commission proposal aims to guarantee uniform training of security consultants, delimits the minimum content of the exams and defines the tasks of the competent authority as well as the needs that the examining instances must respect.Our Parliament declared itself in favor of the text.However, he presented several amendments that for the most part have been taken up in the common position of the Council, in particular as regards the need to process a questionnaire and the declarations on the issue of certain documents in the framework of the ""specification of the examination methods proposed by the exam commission"".On the other hand, to be realistic, I give my support for the postponement of the application of these provisions three months after the entry into force of the directive.I conclude by insisting on the fact that an harmonization of the professional qualification of these consultants will contribute to the improvement of the quality of the service in the interest of users, it will minimize the risks of accidents susceptible to degrade the environment and seriously damage the physical integrity of all those who could come into contact with dangerous goods.Report KOCH (A5-0104/1999) in October I intervened on the report of the honorable Hatzidakis concerning the transport of dangerous goods by railway.My intervention today will not be very different from what I said on that occasion.In practice it is this: Deploro that in such an important sector as the transport of dangerous goods, the adoption of harmonized rules to detrose the safety of men and the environment is relentlessly referred to.I remember that a directive on the approach of the legislation of the Member States on the transport of dangerous goods on the road entered into force on January 1, 1997. It involved a number of transitory provisions valid until 1 January 1999. It is starting from that date that we should have pronounced on a proposal from the European Commission aimed at eliminating those derogations.According to the procedure of use, the CEN, the European normalization committee, proposes the rules for this sector that are subsequently included in the European agreement on international transport on the road of dangerous goods, signed in Geneva in 1957 (known with the acronym Adr), in force throughout Europe and whose provisions are based on the legislation applicable in the EU.The CEN was not able to conduct its works in success within the time given."	it
"However, I wonder: If Turkey is offering a brigade, do we also have to give it the right to have a say in this policy?According to some ""Haider"" in the government, in Turkey.That seems questionable to me.Second, the Baltic states are also ideal.Are they also included in our defense policy?That is at least a very interesting position.Mr. Hoher representative, you have strongly reminded of the progress that we have achieved in this area from Amsterdam to the Helsinki summit, and also to the resolutions that have already been made according to Helsinki, for example to create the three committees or to plan a 50,000 to 60,000 men strongly, which were recently taken during the informal meeting in Sintra.However, this rapid procedure makes the gap between these decisions and the ongoing government conference even clearer.In my opinion, in this context we have to find a sustainable compromise between those who rightly urge this policy area to accelerate this policy area, and that, in the opinion of which such progress must continue to be achieved at the intergovernmental level.I would like to say the latter: be careful because this policy needs great democratic legitimation!We know about the weight of public opinion when it comes to the areas of external and security policy.Therefore, I ask you, of course, only in keywords whether, according to your opinion, some of the following questions can be treated within the framework of the reform: redistribution of the double structure between the Commission and the high representative;A clear and unaffected differentiation between civil and military crisis management.For example, this could mean, for example, that the Commission is involved in the Committee on Politics and Safety Questions that the responsibility of the community for non-military crisis management is strengthened, the Minister of Defense is created and the EU contract, NATO contract and WEU will be coordinated;Further questions would be the legal capacity of the European Union, the increased cooperation in this area, parliamentary control and finally the financial resources.Do you think that some of these questions can at least be included in the agenda of the current government conference?Mr. Solana, I sit close enough to be able to look them in the eye.I think you aged, your face is full of wrinkles.I'm sorry to see her like this and I could despair when I hear her talking about the sandpit games, as Ms. Maes said while at the same time keeping other things.They appear here and do not say a word about the blood that is shed in Kosovo at the same moment.They are responsible for huge responsibility, because under the pretext of ethnic cleansing now flows in other ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.You are Spaniards, you come from a large country, Mr. Solana.Spain was not the same as Franco, it kept its unity and kept the Basque Country and Andalusia and Catalonia - and that was quite the case.Nobody equated Spain with Franco, and nobody has jeopardized Spain's unity, putting a fascist dictator.But today they identify Yugoslavia with Milosevic, they are jeopardizing the Wojwodina, they jeopardize Montenegro, they jeopardize Southern Serbia - they are responsible for the resulting situation."	de
"But it amazed me even more, to read that the French administrations involved knew it for days and did not ask the volunteers to adopt protection measures.I would like the commissioner to inform me if the European Commission was aware that there was a possible risk to public health, and if so, since when.Mr. President, we have to learn lessons from the past.Tomorrow maritime catastrophes such as Erika can occur again on the coasts of the Netherlands, England, Spain or Belgium.The regulation we adopt today in Europe will be considered as a precedent.Therefore, let's be hard with whom it contaminates and generous with those affected.Mr. President, I would like to tell him, echoing the words of some deputies, that the situation, two and a half months after the shipwreck, is still especially critical and is even revealed every day a little broader.There are two points of view: the environment to begin with.The helmet still contains sixteen thousand tons of heavy fuel that escapes;And in addition to these escapes, last week we observe and account, unfortunately, thirty -five acts of ecological piracy, thirty -five tanks that are added unworthy to this absolutely catastrophic situation.About this problem, Mrs. De Palacio has spread a lot and I believe that she has started the works without waiting for what is absolutely necessary today, the outline of a European maritime right, thanks to a directive project on the maritime transport of dangerous goods.It will be found again, from this point of view, with the French will to mark its presidency with regulations directed towards greater security.But it is on the economic level where the second impact occurs -the environmental impact, second the economic impact -, as many deputies have said here.Mollusc breeding, fishing, ostriculture and fish farming are currently severely affected.Because the damage of the storm is added to the black tide, in many places.Unfortunately, these activities have been terribly damaged.They will have, on the one hand, to rebuild and, on the other hand, which is perhaps more complicated, regaining commercial trust.Given this situation, the inhabitants of Brittany, the Vendée and Charente, and in other areas the Silviculs, await a sign of the European Union.We cannot, at the same time, place this mandate under the sign of an approach to citizens and stay ""quiet"", without concrete responses, in the face of phenomena of this order and amplitude.I have taken note, and with great attention, of the words of Commissioner Fischler, who may be the most concrete we have heard today.It is true that there have been manifestations of compassion and solidarity and that things have been announced, but today it is time for a concrete demonstration of European solidarity to continue.Erika's oil discharge is part of the disaster catalog that has recently occurred in community waters, including the pouring of the Braer into Shetland and Sea Empresas de Wales.These discharges, in addition to causing irreparable ecological damage, have devastated local industries."	es
These proposals especially benefit women.Parallel to this European social convergence strategy, a specific plan for legislative work in the social field and proposals for Framework Agreements, with preferred calendars, in the field of social dialogue is needed.We hope that the commission will present this in its proposal for the Social Action Program.Social convergence is also necessary for extension, on the one hand, to strengthen the social model and, on the other, to prevent the risks of social dumping.The Commission must consider, in relation to the extension, the presentation of a special action plan in matters of social policy.The discussions in the commission have been constructive.There were many amendments, but we managed to agree around a report.The amendments that are going to vote in the plenary are now only fifteen.This means that there has been great unit of criteria.Some of these amendments come from processing in the commission.I will reject those.I will also reject the amendments presented by the TDI group, since, in my opinion, they do not add anything new to the report.However, my group will approve the amendment 14 of the Liberal Group.I think it's a good proposal.It is true that it resembles amendment 1, but 14 is better.Finally, I want to say that the EU is not only a commercial collaboration.The EU is also a union for employment and social justice.Social policy has a great role in the creation of citizens Europe.With this report, Parliament wants to deliver its contribution to strengthening the social dimension in European society.We hope that the Council and the Commission take this contribution seriously and incorporate it into the future social policy.The Lisbon Summit is an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this nature.President, I would like to sincerely congratulate the rapporteur, Mr. Andersson, for the report on the modernization of social protection presented here.As coordinator of the European Popular Party in the Employment and Social Affairs Commission I am very satisfied with the commitment achieved, for which Mr. Andersson has worked hard.I am also very satisfied that it has continued from a report from the previous Parliament, whose speaker was me, and the lines of this report are also partly the lines of the previous one.The objective of the communication of the commission of June 1999, which is the basis of the Andersson Report, is to deepen the collaboration between the Member States and the EU in the field of social protection.The other secondary objectives are: to promote employment, that is, to ensure that work offers fixed income;secondly, get safe pensions and viable pension systems;Third, promote social inclusion and fourth, guarantee viable and high quality health care.In all these objectives, aspects related to sex should play an important role.	es
The first legal challenge occurred when the port development of the port began at the beginning of Autumn of 1999, without the compensatory improvements of the habitat having been carried out.Therefore, the Irish authorities agreed to proceed to the withdrawal of the grasses, but this time they did it using mechanical means.The use of mechanical media resulted in a new legal challenge - which I have referred to in my first response - based on the argument that mechanical withdrawal may have damaged the underlying layers of the Barrizal and caused the proliferation of grasses in the estuary with the consequent damage to the environment.To date there is no conclusive result of said legal challenge.The adoption of the appropriate compensatory measures is the competence of the national authorities and does not require the prior approval of the Commission.The role of the commission consists in ensuring the faithful compliance with the norms established by the Directive related to the conservation of wild birds, and there is no doubt that there would be problems with the compensatory measures that have also caused damage.In this case, the Commission proposes to request new clarifications from the Irish authorities about the current position regarding compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical withdrawal of grasses.At the moment we are not willing to propose the suspension of financing charged to structural funds.Mr. President, unfortunately, the specific case raised by Mrs. McKenna is not an isolated case.There are other examples of conservation in special scientific fields that are being harmed as a result of community financing.Will the commission study the possibility of providing instructions to all member states in the sense that, if in the future it is discovered that European directives on the environment are breached or an evaluation of the appropriate environmental impact is not carried out, not only will the financing suspend, but that it will withdraw the funds that have already been granted, in other words, that will claim the funds of the Member States?Only measures of this type will brake on these practices in the future..(SV) This is a matter of great importance.As the deputies to the European Parliament surely know, our predecessors in the commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies, jointly sent a letter on the relationship between the structural funds, the money of the structural funds, and the directive on habitat and bird protection.The message that was sent in this joint letter is still in force.We cannot give money to countries with one hand and with the other take them to court and, perhaps, force them to pay fines.That is why it is important that this is coordinated.Obviously the result can lead us to have difficult decisions.However, in my opinion, the main effect is that countries are going to think a lot and, above all, they will send their lists of the sites covered by Natura 2000, so that we can control and do studies properly.In this Ireland has deficiencies, just like other member countries, but we hope that this pressure will give results.Once again I want to emphasize that the content of this letter is still valid.	es
I must confess that even in my country, Flanders, the road to go is still long.We also recently been the subject of criticism from the Commission in this regard.Each reasonable person wants this framework directive to be used to exercise pressure on negligent politicians.The common location on this point is a farce, a completely voluntary work, a real face to the OSPAR agreements.Not to mention the deadlines for implementation, which can be extended even up to 34 years.Then my children will have more years than I have now.Let's face it: it is not a serious proposal.Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to choose between a weak and non -binding picture that will poison the future of our children;Or we can vote in favor of the amendments of my group, the speaker or the Environment Commission, public health and consumer policy.Finally still one aspect.In recent months, the activities of the lobbies have intensified enormously and what in this file has jumped particularly to the eyes was the pressure that the Council of Ministers has exercised.In my country both even by the Flemish and Vallone Ministry of the Environment.The ministers preferred the weak position common to the decisive position of our Parliament.I wonder if this choice was made with the approval of the Green Environmental Ministers of my country.Ladies colleagues, the beautiful words are no longer enough.We have to change course with great resolution.Tomorrow, at the time of the vote we have the opportunity to clearly say that Europe undertakes in favor of a policy in the field of responsible and future -oriented waters, which can only contribute to strengthening our credibility.The discussion is suspended.Will resume at 9.00 pm.Dialogue on Europe: prospects of institutional reform The agenda bears the communication of the Commission on dialogue on Europe: prospects of institutional reform.Mr. President, honorable deputies, the commission is discussing it right now and is far from concluding his works by today.So I am essentially here to talk to you, as indicated by the agenda of your assembly, of a new initiative of the Commission, which intends to give its own response, which is not the only one, to the great challenge aimed at mobilizing all the protagonists of the European construction.Among them, in the front row, you are there as parliamentarians, but I too are as commissioner, as well as the ministers of the Council, the national parliamentarians and I would even say the officials who work at our institutions and who are committed and motivated by the European construction.This morning, in the long debate to which I attended the president of you, many of you have evoked the democratic deficit, the distance of the European institutions.In saying it, I am not limited to lifting the question - moreover already formulated with clarity and vigor from one of you: who does what?There must be at least citizens to understand who does what among our various institutions.It is essentially also of knowing: what do we do together and what do we intend to do in the future, in particular with the countries of next adherence?	it
In this perspective, Activity Based Management is the key tool to ensure correspondence between objectives, actions and resources.The second point are human resources.This is the supporting axis of our action: staff is our true wealth, it is the wealth of the Commission.It is a staff of the highest qualities, a quality that is difficult - perhaps impossible - to find in individual national administrations, precisely for the ways and criteria for recruiting staff.This is the impression that I had coming to the presidency and that I confirmed in my daily work.However, I found, at the same time, a very low morality from the administration: before they were pride, the pleasure of being part of an institution admired by everyone;Today there is often demoralization, generated for months and months of criticism.All this must change, and this is one of the fundamental reasons for our reform.Recruitment, career structure, mobility, disciplinary regime, everything is governed with absolutely new criteria: more space for individual merit, credible and above all verifiable evaluation systems, continuous training and greater responsibility for managers.These are the fields in which we will move.Third point, also very delicate and key in the previous crisis: financial management.This is the joint that must ensure efficiency and safety.We will create a management and control system in every general direction.Today we have an entirely centralized control system;With the reform we move on to a control system that combines decentralization of management controls and an effective central audit system: this means that we will have a central financial service, which will give a guide and consultancy for financial management, a decentralization in every general direction of the entire chain, that is, programs, commitments, contracts, expenses and related ex -contained control systems, and an external audit service that will control all these operations.This is a complete revolution in the Commission's way of working, it is an entirely new organization, which also requires an absolutely new culture.We are aware of the problems related to this transition phase and it is this transition that has created more concern in our staff: therefore we will take the necessary safety and safeguard measures.With the reform, in fact, the Commission wants to become an administration that constitutes a model of excellence throughout Europe and all over the world.We want to be a model also for the advanced use of information technologies.We want to be an entirely computerized administration model.The commission was accused of being buried by the card and we will then be a Paperless Commission, that is, a commission without the use of paper tools.This is to be more efficient inside and to multiply the use of new technologies on the outside.This is a revolution that is not only technique but a complete organizational revolution.I will now leave to Neil Kinnock the task of illustrating the details of this reform, not without first thanking him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy with which he conducted this work.	it
"First of all, the perhaps fundamental aspect of the proposal is the idea - intrinsic to the recycling and reuse of the residues - to use materials that can later pollute less.Another important point is that the waste - even those containing PVC - and not only those containing lead, cadmium and mercury - should not be incinerated or shredded.In this regard, Parliament is involved in a discussion in another area.Another question then concerns those who have to pay the expenses.I agree with the speakers who preceded me when they say that ""those who pollute pays"" and our proposal reiterates it better than ever.While knowing that in the end the expenses are probably downloaded to consumers, the producers must pay, which are required to take charge of the costs prior to 2006 based on some of the amendments.In any case, we prefer the amendment of the first reading.It is also important to fix the percentage and date within which vehicles will have to be made of recyclable materials, but I believe that the proposal provides very far away.Finally, Mr. President, I believe it is necessary to encourage the birth of small and medium -sized enterprises which, approved with rigor and with due authorization, can promote the creation of jobs in this crucial sector, avoiding the monopolies of large companies.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the European Parliament today has to face real responsibilities.It is about establishing what we will do with the millions of vehicles that we abandon every year.In some of our states, voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed for our ditches, our channels and our fields no longer fill those horrendous and dangerous abandoned cars, from which a frightened hen came out occasionally.Of course, I come from a proud country of its automotive industry and commercial successes, both in Europe and in third countries.And I evaluate its importance for the international prestige of my country.I know the proactive behaviors of the European automotive industry that has implemented a vast research program to develop a national system of information for the dismantling of vehicles that have reached their lives.I am aware of the difficulties encountered by the Council to find a compromise.This is why today we must be including alchemists, worried about our environment.This century must necessarily be the century of waste management.For me, in any case, the ""polluting pays"" principle must be applied.I am sure that the automotive industry, increasingly respectful of the environment, had foreseen this awareness.And the responsibility is assumed.But it is up to states to apply this directive, and let's be careful from detailed too much, since industrial traditions, the methods of demolition and crushing professionals are different depending on whether you are in Italy or Finland.I oppose the fact of making vehicle owners responsible.These men and women who move to Europe pay their car, their national taxes, their catalytic mufflers, their taxes on fuels, and therefore pay the price of their splendid car and the freedom to circulate."	it
"Our general policy consists, however, in recognizing the inherent dignity and the exceptional contribution of native peoples to the development and plurality of society, which we consider particularly important in the context of the Nordic dimension that we are trying to develop and which we discuss with North America.The commission shares the growing concern due to the disappearance of the Russian journalist, Mr. Babitsky, and under the conditions of the independent media of Chechnya in general.This subject is at the top of our main concerns in the face of the critical situation of the civilian population of Chechnya, which Mr. Posselt has just spoken.Alarming news talks about human rights violations.It is obvious that there has been a disproportionate appeal to force in this conflict.The commission delegation in Moscow participated in a troika approach in the European Union on 11 of this month.She underlined her strong concerns about press freedom and freedom of expression and insisted that the Russians clarify the circumstances of Mr. Babitstky's detention, taking into account their obligations in the field of human rights.We expect Russians an appropriate response.In the meantime, the conclusions to which the ""General Affairs"" council arrived at the start of the week confirmed the message I gave today.We are willing to repent on the subject during the ministerial Troika UE-Russia which will take place in Lisbon on March 2, if necessary.Finally, with regard to Cambodia and Khmer Rouge, we fully agree that we must continue the highest leaders of the Khmer Rouge for the crimes for which they are responsible.I totally agree with the arguments that Mr. Morillon has advanced.We energetically supported the procedure of the Troika company with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Hor Namhong, on February 4 of this year.The European Union stressed that it completely supported the UN efforts as to the need for the court to continue the former heads of the Khmer Rouge.In addition, we also salute the continuous dialogue between the two parties.The optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, on the chances of achieving an agreement concerning the proposed court, is encouraging.The Commission will continue to remind the Cambodian authorities the problems with regard to the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights, through the CE-Cambodge cooperation agreement which entered into force on November 1.Debate human rights twice in a few days will have been useful.I hope that we will still have the opportunity, but I hope that we will have less examples of their violation during the years to come.Thank you very much, Mr. Patten.The debate is closed.The vote will take place at 6 p.m.Environmental disaster in the waters of the Danube The agenda calls for the common discussion on the following resolution proposals: B5-0164/2000 of Mr. Leinen, on behalf of the group of the PSE group, B5-0167/2000 of MEATEN and Thors deputies, on behalf of the Eldr, B5-0168/2000 of the OOSTLANDER and GRANDETEVER deputies, on behalf of PPE-DE,"	fr
Thus, we have submitted an urgency application that we grant.We have been requested 35 million euros.We access to grant them and ask the commission to be very vigilant so that, once the decision is adopted, they commit and pay the sums as quickly as possible.It is a financial macroayuda.It provokes reactions here and there, because it does not respect the canons of liberal beauty, consisting of not intervening financially to sustain an administration.That is not our opinion.Our opinion is that it is essential to contribute to the constitution of an administration in Kosovo and nothing is absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public agents in that region.For the rest, it would have been something very useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990 decade to avoid liquefaction of that state.The second important problem is that we have been requested, donors have committed and it is manifested that we are the only ones we pay.The others do not pay.We ask that this unilaterality cease in financial requests.We want the commission to commit to the amendments we propose in that regard.We want to link the delivery of the totality of the aid to the mobilization of the funds that the other donors owe.It is not to limit, to escape, our financial support for Kosovo, but, on the contrary, to ensure that our contribution is added to the other donors.From that point of view, the proposed is a two -stroke and should be unlock the second section from the moment the donors have expressed interest.Finally, we ask in that regard three questions to the Commission: First, we must regularly deliver the list and amounts of the contributions of the other donors.We want to know what others pay at the time we pay.Secondly, we want to have an exact state of tenders and their commitment rhythm.During the budget procedure we have been told that it was urgent to vote for money for Kosovo and, according to our information, today has not yet been made public or any tender has been organized.That is serious, because it delays the entire Kosovo reconstruction process.Finally -and as a consequence of what I just said -we want the commission to report very regularly, monthly, to the Budget Commission, on the state of execution of expenses.We have commission documents that talk about firm commitments.We do not need firm commitments, we simply need commitments and need to know what is paid effectively and above all what is not paid.Kosovo has suffered too much with paying delays.Mr. President, like so many times we talk today about Kosovo and is time for us to take stock of what has already been achieved in Kosovo, if something has been achieved.	es
With regard to the future provisions regarding the aid to the steelurge, which will come into force since July 2002, we will continue to continue to apply a rigorous discipline, whose necessity is now shared by the same industrial environments.When we have developed our proposal regarding the new rules and chosen the most suitable legal form, I will be happy to export our vision.Here, Mr. President, what I bring home from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, is an intellectual and political support, it seems to me without distinction, of the European Parliament to the competition policy, a basic appreciation for the work that the Commission does and a trust so that it can continue to carry it out in the future, things that I am particularly grateful.We will continue, in particular with the Commission for economic and monetary problems, but more generally with Parliament, that interinstitutional dialogue that has been established.In this regard, I liked his expression, honorable Palacio: we must all row and, possibly, in the same direction.Competition is not a goal, as the Honorable Rapkay rightly observed, but a very important tool of our European construction.As the honorable von Wogau said at the beginning of the debate, the competition in the end is not an abstract thing: it is in the interest of citizens, it is the basis of the social market economy.I would also like to say that, in European construction, competition has had and will also continue to have a civil and not only economic value.Thank you, Commissioner Monti.The joint discussion is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, at 12.00.Criminal protection of the financial interest of the Union of the agenda bears the report (A5-0002/2000), presented by the honorable Theato on behalf of the Commission for the Budget Control, containing Parliament's recommendations to the Commission on the establishment of criminal protection of the financial interest of the Union.Mr. President, year after year, we learn, especially from the reports of the European Court of Auditors, that the European Union's budget undergoes losses caused by waste, bad management, irregularities and - as is suspected - even real fraud.For some time Parliament has taken the field to start initiatives to protect the money of European taxpayers who, ultimately, feeds the Union's budget.In this context, the anti -flap struggle aimed at revealing, punishing and preventing such practices deserves particular attention.The institution of UCLAF, the Task Force and the creation of the Office for the Olaf Anti -Frount Struggle have been important stages on this path, as was the regulation relating to the protection of the financial interests of the community and the controls on the spot.In cases of fraud manifest, the union can however only impose administrative sanctions;So far the requests of the commission to return the funds received without the right title have had little success;The criminal action is instead reserved for Member States.Given that often the two legal areas overlap, and that the actions to the detriment of the Union's budget are increasing in all countries and are also perpetrated by organized crime, the competences between the Member States are not always clear.	it
"And it is a woman who was elected.The other event concerns France where a law was voted to have that women and men were represented equally, following the declaration made in April 1999 at the ""women and men in power"" congress.The ministers concerned were committed to taking concrete measures and policies that would change power data.We must congratulate the Prime Minister, Mr. Jospin, to have ratified this commitment in the most clear and most formal way.Many have been the statements made and the policies carried out in the Member States.Certainly, the figures tell the truth.And the figures for Europe are still problematic.Women represent 24 % of governments, and 22 % on average for deputies of national parliament, or a rate varying from 6 % in certain member states to 40 % in others.The number of women in commissions exercising power, developing policies, is very reduced.Even in countries like Germany or Belgium, which have precise legal obligations concerning the number of representatives of both sexes, the participation rate of women in the various commissions does not exceed 18 %.It is therefore advisable to promote concrete policies.There is a mixed policy that will include long -term political commitments, as is now in Sweden and Finland where we have a respective rate of 56 and 44 % of women in government today.Organization and statistical follow -up.Appropriate control and structures are needed according to culture, mentalities and specific problems in each region.And, of course, these policies require a budget, financial support.The increase in the number of women, or, as the French Prime Minister said, Mr. Jospin, the increase in the influence of women on decision -making centers, is the best way to renovate political life, to modify the approach of problems, to enrich the political thought of new ideas and experiences - those that women transmit through their different way of life and development.The recent initiative of the Finnish presidency aimed at establishing indicators identifying and reflecting the participation of women in decision -making centers is of great importance.These are indicators encompassing national parliaments, regional councils, municipal councils, and which give a complete table of women's participation in each Member State.I consider that it is a major political question to create and support statistical data, that it is a tool or a political means to set objectives, compare performance and assist our efforts.Such an initiative aimed at systematic monitoring is also inserted in the project that I will submit for the fifth program for women.It should be added that, if the legislative measures and institutional interventions of the Member States have effects on the decision -making centers of political power, we do not observe the same effects in the private sector.Contacts that I had with very large European companies and multinationals on our continent, a dramatic assessment is released.There are companies that employ thousands of thousands of workers at European level at European level, or even often, and in which the participation of women in management and management is less than 2 %!"	fr
I fear strongly that we were once again in an authority that evolves like an anonymous satellite across Europe: I would appreciate a authority like the devil the holy water.I hope we can't get there.I also salute the white paper.But do you think that the food security agency will have enough biting to prevent an event from the BUF war that we knew and to prevent France refuses to lift the ban on?Have you said that the Commission could refrain from granting subsidies to countries that act like France?Would you also propose that the Commission can give provisional payments, for example, similar to those that British breeders are currently asking for?Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, you said during the plenary session last week that the future European food agency for food security would not settle in the outskirts, but you did not say what you heard by periphery.For example, the action of the EU unit established in Dublin has shown that a physical distance is no longer an obstacle to the efficiency and the establishment of contacts.The primordial missions of the future food agency have been the subject of data, multiple announcements, all coordination work.We have published recommendations for the development of this food security and - as you have noticed - we have gathered scientific knowledge and we popularized them.With current techniques, all of this can be done anywhere in the European Union.So I ask you where you plan to install this agency.Regarding the composition of authority: first, it will use on -site scientists who will collaborate and lead consultations with expert scientists in the particular fields studied at a given time.In addition, this food security authority will have a council.You will notice that we have not specified the composition of this advice in the white paper.This is a question that I expect to be discussed between Parliament and the Commission in the coming weeks and in the coming months.I plan that the Council will be made up of key players or representatives of key actors.Its function must be established in detail in the proposal I will present to the Commission in September.We haven't done it yet but it will be done in September.I do not expect council to exercise any function consisting in directing scientists in the way of doing their work.This would affect the independence of scientific advice.But it would have a global competence, which would consist, for example, to ask this authority to investigate in particular fields requiring research.Mr. Florenz asks if the parliament will have his say in this area.This is a question that requires examination and discussion.There may be a number of points of view on this subject.Some could estimate that it would not be wise for Parliament or the deputies of the Parliament - or, in fact, the people appointed by the Parliament - to be part of the Council.	fr
We know that this directive is based on EC law and not on EU law.Before the elections, however, we all - Council, Commission, Parliament, the press, unions and companies, we have worked to make this Europe more understandable to citizens.We claimed that the citizen knew how to go from the EEC to the CE and then to the EU.Now the EU is a clear concept.We therefore do not make a good service to ourselves, nor to citizens, if the document we release will be called the EC card to provide services and not instead EU card.The citizen is interested in the EU world, that is his world.I therefore invite the Council and the Commission to move in this direction.Mr. President, it was later made of what was expected at the beginning of this session;I will therefore try to be as short as possible.One of the reasons why we lingered so is that today we have rightly dedicated a part of our time to reaffirm the vigorous opposition of this parliament to any form of xenophobia and racism.Of course, the directive does not directly concern these topics.Instead, it concerns the needs of the internal market, as well as the need to guarantee flexibility and to adopt a reasonable and flexible attitude to allow third countries to find employment both as employees and as self -employed.In itself this means avoiding unnecessary restrictions towards foreigners simply as foreigners.We completely agree with this approach, in our opinion appropriate and reasonable, and consequently we will support the largest possible interpretation that you seem to be in accordance with the law.Mr President, Mr. Commissioner, I would like to report the excellent work done by the Honorable Berger and, in general, by the legal commission and for the internal market, which has included innovative ideas in this directive, with the hope that they will be accepted by Commission and Council.However, I presented an amendment.Mr Berger, in amendment n.2, considering 6, she invokes legal certainty.The first point on which we disagree is the three -month extension of the residence permit, which actually creates legal uncertainties.She expressed the concern, shared by the honorable Wieland, that a worker may disappear once the work permit has expired, but it seems to me that such a possibility is strengthened by the three -month extension.If the validity of the service performance card ends in a certain date, it must expire on that date;Legal certainty requires it.Secondly, regarding point d) of amendment no.10, which refers to the first directive, is expected that, for public safety reasons or for public order rules, a Member State may contest the validity of the card.There are already ex -doors checks provided for in article 4 of the directive.A similar arrangement would not make sense for a worker of the Schengen area, who has already undergone investigations to enter the first Member State;The second Member State can, ex ante, oppose a refusal justified to the entry of this worker into his territory.	it

"For the sectors of aquaculture and oyster breeding, which are defenselessly exposed to the unstoppable pollution on the coasts, the consequences are very serious, not only because of the immediate pollution of the first few days, but also due to the later loss of market shares and the rejection of a product with all guarantees, which is affected by the pollution itself, by consumers.It is about outskirts with an unstable economic balance, which was severely damaged by this oil spill, which unfortunately does not represent an individual case.The main resources of these regions - like those of other neighboring areas - are the ones who have nature ready.A nature that is too often caused by human activity, which could be prevented with greater caution and greater control on the part of state power.""Prevention is better than healing,"" says a saying and also says the household.Ladies and gentlemen, preventing is very inexpensive compared to the costs of disasters like this.Mr. Fischler says he is always there when the parliament calls him.In the case of the Erika, however, he gave the appearance - maybe not with us, but yet with the inhabitants of Brittany and Vendée - as a commissioner for fisheries or only to be temporarily on hand.As this parliament showed in its first resolution of January 20 of this year, the needs of fishing, oyster breeding and tourism, which are particularly affected, must be taken into account.That is why we asked the Commission to adopt measures for the fishing sector through the mobilization of special funds.Galicia and Brittany, both the end of the world in Europe, have also been siblings through this oil spill.We also cannot understand that experiences such as those with the Urquiola or the Amoco Cádiz have not led to strengthen legislation in the field of maritime traffic in terms of security in dangerous goods and with regard to the low-cost flags.We demand that this time is the last one.We demand that we pull all teachings and quickly change our laws and fill the gaps that always confront us with the incredible and make the incredible reality.The cause principle seems to be appropriate and beyond that.It is now time that the polluters will start paying, because so far those affected and taxpayers have paid.And the polluters should not only pay, but also to clean the affected areas.Therefore, I am pleased about Mr. Fischler's answer, especially that he recognizes the need for retrospective measures and the rapid reaction to the request received.In the name of my faction, the socialist fraction, I would like to address a solidarity message to those affected, to the fishermen, the breeders and the entrepreneurs who make it possible for the sea to put its products on time on time, to the mayors and the politically controllers as well as the volunteers who were involved in cleaning.They should all be insured by our solidarity.I would like to ask the Commissioner two questions.The parliament has assumed a resolution in which it is required to apply the pollutant principle in this case and to make both the ship owner and the owner of the freight liable for the damage."	de
"Mr. President, I agree that from the point of view of efficiency and analysis of the services offered in relation to costs, progress remains to be made.But why always under the brand of ""privatization"" and ""liberalization"", I absolutely do not understand it myself, and I am a business leader.If it is that we do not care to ensure for all conditions of access identical to postal services but that we are only concerned with the conditions for the development of capital for companies in large agglomerations.However, deputies must be the representatives of all citizens, and this means that they are in the obligation to reflect not in terms of business economy but in terms of political economy.Very concretely for postal services, this means, first, that the question of employment must be a priority.I have nothing against liberalization and privatization, but the premises must grant themselves.Second, we must have the guarantee that there will be no decrease in postal services for the citizen.Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this threat is very real.Mr. Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country where after liberalization, prices have radically exceeded those of all the other member states of the European Union.It is precisely also a possible effect.We must ensure that it does not happen.Third, it remains essential in the first place to ensure a universal postal service at a reasonable price for each citizen, in any place.Secondly, a single price should be observed for all Member States.And thirdly, it is necessary to guarantee a distribution of mail and a lifting each working day.Regarding the question of the price/service ratio for respective postal shipping categories, it is possible to consider other price reductions.This is what La Poste also declares itself.It should not remain more than 300 g, the analysis shows that a minimum limit of 150 g must be guaranteed so that it can still count.I think that today's debate has been beneficial and important insofar as Mr. Bolkestein knows the position of this Parliament and can also take into account the problems from the start.Mr. President, the 1997 directive, published on January 21, 1998, which initiated a partial liberalization of postal services in Europe, provided for a later revision, in a form of elsewhere complicated, since it was to be the subject of a commission proposal before the end of 1998, then be decided before January 1, 2000, to finally enter into force before January 1, 2003.zero.The first two steps were not respected, which, logically, should compromise the third.First question: anyway, were the expected deadlines not too short?Obviously, yes.We really do not see how the Commission could have evaluated, before the end of 1998, as provided for in article 7 of the directive, the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year."	fr
I encourage the deputies to guarantee today with their votes that we manage to establish some sensible bases for Europe in the short term, if it cannot be longer term.Mr. President, be my first words of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr. Schmidt, my colleague, Mr. Goebbels, and my colleagues from Grupo Villiers and Lulling, who, despite maintaining discrepant positions at some points, have always had an extraordinarily constructive attitude.As the rapporteur has already pointed out, we are probably arguing one of the most important issues that we will discuss in this legislature.Collective investment agencies have long been the first savings instrument, the instrument through which millions of individual, non -expert, non -professional citizens, consecrate or deliver the savings of their lives to these agencies.This would be the first reason to say that we must proceed to liberalization, but with prudence.Because?Because the bankruptcy of a bank is a problem that can have a solution for any government.Bankruptcy, the suspension of payments, from an organism of these characteristics would create a political, social and citizen problem of incalculable consequences.A second argument leads me to accentuate the need for prudence in the regulation of these organisms.It is my belief in the social market economy, which is based on a market that works, but that works subject to certain rules aimed at guaranteeing the general interest, which, at this time and this specific issue, is limited to the protection of consumers.This basic principle of liberalization, of increased competition, of increased investment opportunities, linked to the prudence for the protection that consumers deserve, is the one that has determined and inspired the position of my group in most of the controversial issues that have been indicated here.First, the problem of investment in non -harmonized agencies, that is, in the agencies that camp outside this directive.It is obvious that, by expanding the proposal we are studying here, the possibilities, the investment range of collective investment agencies, those agencies that remain outside will be forced to invest in high -risk funds.And it would be clumsy allowing regulated organisms, protected organisms, could invest in organizations dedicated to investments as risky as those I have said.Second, the problem of derivatives is one of the ones that has divided the most into the group and in relation to the other groups.We have reached a compromise solution.We all admit that investment in derivatives should be limited regulation, legally, to prevent a harmonized fund from losing all its assets due to an investment in high -risk products.It is obvious that this risk is higher when the investment is materialized in derivatives not negotiated in regulated markets, the famous OTC.We believe that we have reached an acceptable commitment solution, and I congratulate myself for it.As this issue does not end here but will return to this assembly, I would like to make some allusion to the work method between the Commission and the Parliament.The texts that we are discussing here are old and were already old when they reached this Parliament because they had suffered important modifications during the Finnish presidency of the Council.We find two options: return the bull to the corral, that is, return the proposals to the commission to send us a harmonized text or continue advancing.	es
"Undoubtedly, the events in Kosovo and overall moved our hearts and thinking in the Balkans;There were important things in the Middle East, where the Parliament President played an important role on her last trip;Some important things have happened to clear the way for the summit between Europe and Africa, in which I was able to participate together with the Portuguese presidency;There was the big conference in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America, to establish closer relationships between the European Union and the countries of Latin America.Undoubtedly, we were also close to the heart of Chechnya, and I will have the opportunity to say a few words at the end of my explanations after I had an important conversation with the representative of the European Council, Mr. Álvaro Gil-Robles, about his recent visit to the region.But I assume that you asked me here to tell you directly about foreign policy and, above all, security policy in Europe in Helsinki.I will go into that briefly;If you would like to address inquiries to me in the question time, I will be happy to answer you.Allow me to remind me that the summit in Helsinki did not take place under the Finnish presidency a century ago, but only two months ago.In Helsinki, fundamental decisions were made on our continent for foreign and security policy.It was mainly three types of decisions, and I would like to respond to them.The first was the decision on the formation of triple committees in the European Union to make decisions in the field of crisis management: first, a committee for political and security issues;Second, a military committee as representation of the head of the general staff of the fifteen states of the Union;And thirdly, there were decisions about the relationships that the European Union had to entertain with third countries and other organizations.Above all, I refer to the relationships between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and the relationships between the European Union and those countries that geographically belong to Europe, but not or at least at the moment not belong to the European Union.I will essentially limit myself to these three points to keep them up to date with the events.For the first and as far as the decision -making bodies are concerned, this morning, on March 1, 2000, the committee for political and security issues (APS), which had been used on the last council ""general affairs"", met for the first time.So two months after the explanation and the decision made in Helsinki, we have a conference of the committee for political and security issues for the first time in the European Union.I had the opportunity this morning to meet him and be at lunch with the representatives.I can tell you that you can be satisfied.The fifteen states have named knowledgeable diplomats at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important topics that we have to face in the coming months.Second, the military committee, which represents the various chiefs of general staff of the fifteen states, will hold its first session a little more than two months after the explanations of Helsinki.As you can imagine, this military committee has several obligations.In a preliminary, an interim stage, his main task will be to advise the advice and myself and to make the first decisions on how the final organs are to be used, which we absolutely want to make at the end of 2000 or early next year."	de
In addition, an extraordinary budget line should be used, as extraordinary is the catastrophic situation.First, we would like to express our condolence to all the families and communities that have lost a member in that terrible tragedy.Loss of life is what really makes this particular disaster extraordinary in Europe.It is unfortunate that we do not have an instrument with which to provide assistance in situations like this.I want to thank the commissioner for his detailed statement on this matter and his proposal that we organize ourselves at the European level to provide assistance to the Member States and those of their regions suffering from tragedies like this.That is important.Another thing we must remember is that in the past we did have a budget line.It was very small.He could not do much, but the deputies to this assembly abused her repeatedly by proposing actions when disasters were not even important.The officials and ministers of the Member States went to Brussels, whispered with the commission, obtained a few euros and pointed somewhat political when they returned with help for their constituencies.So there was not too much compassion for that budget line, when he abolished it.I think we must restore that budget line.When there was the earthquake in Greece, which was a great disaster, the community lacked an instrument with which to offer its condolence or solidarity to the Greeks.The same happened when there were floods in France and the same now.Those are important disasters and we should have an instrument, which we don't have.We must restore that instrument and we must make the standards very strict so that only in situations where serious disasters occur we resort to that specific instrument.We can save it from one year to another and ensure that, when something important happens, let us have an instrument to face it.This time in Ireland it has not been so serious, although we have had very strong storms from the Atlantic.We have also had floods in Ireland, so I want to express my solidarity with the people of Ireland who have suffered them.Ladies, we should not, both, lose memory.It is true that there is a joint decision of the Commission and the Parliament aimed at suppressing the emergency lines.It is also true that there is a lot of European money -Commissioner Barnier has indicated that, in the case of ostreiculture and agriculture, article 30 of the regulation related to rural development would be appealed, in that of silviculture to article 33, in that of the companies to the repeal of the legislation on the competence set forth in section 2 of article 87 of the Treaty, in that of public teams, to the structural funds.Even so, it is not going to unlock today a cent more than what was distributed before the storm to manifest a concrete, active solidarity.It is simply that states play communicating vessels and take here what they will give elsewhere.	es
It is evident that in the future e -mail and electronic commerce will acquire enormous importance and it seems to me that this constitutes a strong point for our posts.We know that until 2002 about 1.2 million jobs will not be busy in the field of electronic commerce, because the workers in possession of the qualifications necessary to meet the needs of this market are missing, which in my opinion represents a sector in which the post office must intervene with training courses, as well as professional training and continues to prepare their employees to cope with this interesting challenge.The existing post offices in rural areas naturally enjoy a strategic advantage, since mail can count on a dense distribution network throughout Europe;Even in the smallest village there is in fact a post office.In the future, in the framework of electronic commerce, the mail will be increasingly used, since many order goods and send invoices and other documents by e -mail and websites.Consequently, the importance of the material performance of these transactions also increases, which gives a new meaning to collection, sorting, transport and delivery.I believe that this constitutes an opportunity not to be missed for the future.Our task of politicians is to defend the interests of consumers;We want them to get the best with the money they earn by working, and the reduction of postal services costs is therefore a fundamental goal.We will also have to verify, also through benchmarking procedures, how much it currently spends a consumer for an employee of the public post office and how much for an employee of a private service.Transparency is also essential for the unions, since the position of a trade unionist who must represent his colleagues from a private company is very different from that of a trade unionist of a public postal service;However, I believe that also for the union it is important that there are similar framework conditions from an economic and social point of view in order to obtain the best for workers in a spirit of fairness, loyalty and solidarity.I think then that in the future it will be necessary to make the universal service more interesting: we will have to define it precisely, draw up a list of the provided services and call for a tender.In my opinion, in the rural areas, where there is to be feared that the costs cannot be covered, the services should be specified by a regulatory body that should indirect contracts in order to allow the participation of all market forces - and therefore also existing postal services -, thus following an optimal strategy for the consumer and oriented to stimulate efficiency.In my opinion, it is necessary to avoid providing further grants;Instead, we must ensure that private companies and consumers can draw advantages from the new system.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, postal services, like any European public service, contribute to the social cohesion of the Community territory in accordance with article 16 of the Amsterdam Treaty.By guaranteeing tariff equalization, i.e. a rigorous equality of citizens and economic actors compared to the cost of the service, taking on the obligations of the universal service and adapting to an need for quality, postal services share our concern to ensure equal treatment to the different territories and the people who live there.	it
It is true that economic aid, in this regard, is a certainly essential element of the possibilities of action which will be given to those present in the field.I take up here the statement that Doris Pack has just made us, and I insist that we have, in the European Parliament, to hold our responsibilities in this regard, but obviously by asking not to be the only ones.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to warmly thank the rapporteur, our colleague Brok, for his report.If the council had worked as quickly as Mr. Brok did, we would actually be much more advanced.You really have to deplore the negligence of the council in this area.In his report, the rapporteur is very important to the principle that we have a duty to provide rapid help but also, rightly, from the principle that this aid cannot be offered without limits and without discernment.In this regard, I would particularly like to emphasize the amendment 5 proposal which very clearly establishes that the credits of exceptional financial aid can only cover the budgetary needs of public, semi-public and municipal Kosovar administrations and institutions which are controlled directly or indirectly by the Minuk.It must be clear, Mr. Commissioner, that we support the mini, that we support the institutions put in place by the United Nations - in particular, of course, the fourth pillar - and it is unacceptable that we support the parallel structures which formed and continue to exist in Kosovo.What to do with this money?I would particularly like to emphasize human rights.In Kosovo, the West fought for human rights.What's going on today in Kosovo?We have been able to put an end to the great expulsion action carried out by the Serbs but, almost every day, unacceptable incidents take place;People are killed, people are prevented from living there and as they want.Each day, there are attacks on Serbs, Roma, Bosnians but also, as before, against Albanians.If this information is correct, I was really frightened to learn that an Albanian doctor, who worked - certainly at the cost of great difficulties - in the hospital located in the Serbian part of Mitroviça, finally gave up operating there for his fellow citizens because his life was regularly threatened.These are incidents and situations that we cannot tolerate.I heard - I don't know if it is correct or not - whether the Serbs even continue to exploit a mine in Kosovo, in the Serbian part.Rumors claim that Serbian militias are still active.It doesn't matter if threats or crimes are committed against a Serbian, a Roma, a Bosnian or an Albanian.I don't care who works on the dismemberment and the partition of Kosovo.What matters to me is that the organs we finance reach the objective we want to achieve, that of a multi-ethnic Kosovo, of a coexistence in Kosovo.	fr
"The Commission is in favor of this coding and will be responsible for preparing as soon as possible a coded version as soon as the proposals have been approved, and with reservation of their right of initiative.However, I cannot adopt as is the writing of the recital.For the rest, the Commission believes that some of the amendments presented by the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs would substantially modify the content of the first proposal.By virtue of this, the Commission regrets not to accept the following amendments to the first proposal.Amendment 8 would hinder the application of this Directive by replacing the most accurate reference to the instruments contemplated in ""Article 19 of this Directive"" by the most general reference to the investments ""covered by this Directive"".In addition, this amendment could lead to divergent interpretations in the different member states since they will probably become relevant instruments in other articles of the directive.The amendment 16 endangers the protection of investors since the prohibition of constituting a guarantee before the depositary is a contradictio in terminis.Compensation and securities bags and cameras do not automatically cover the loan loan operations carried out through them, unlike the sale of values.Therefore, we cannot adopt the proposed amendment.The amendment 42 refers to an issue that was not modified by the proposal and that has not raised any problem from the moment the directive entered into force.I do not see, therefore, any reason to suppress section 3 of article 22, which leads me to reject the amendment.The amendment 44 is unacceptable because when demanding that the non -harmonized funds meet the requirements of the regulations ""imposed by the directive"" relative to credits, loans and sales in discovered and the depositary creates a situation in which very few funds, for example the Swiss funds, can offer their services in the field of investments.This does not agree with the objective of the commission to expand the range of investment modalities.In addition, I do not rule out that the formulation of the attentive amendment against the GATT agreements.Nor can we accept the proposed modifications with respect to the first paragraph of article 22 of the amendment 47, since they contradict the principle of diversification contemplated in article 22, especially given that the IACVM must necessarily indicate a reference point in their brochures, as agreed by the Council.However, the main problem of the first proposal lies in the amendment of Parliament that considers the possibility of using the Over The Counter instruments for general investment purposes.The Commission indicates that the national law of some Member States already contemplates the use of OTC derivatives for general investment purposes.However, the Commission has decided to suspend its point of view due to the high risks inherent to this type of investments compared to the most traditional financial instruments.In my opinion, OTC derivatives can create problems since it is not about liquid instruments, it is difficult to estimate their price and involve counterpart risks that are not covered.It seems incoherent that a very prudent approach is chosen in terms of investments in non -harmonized funds or deposits refers to the time that investments is given to investments in much more risky instruments such as OTC derivatives."	es
Once again I would like to express my thanks for the quality of the work done, not only the rapporteur, but the entire committee.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.Closing the annual session period I declare the annual session 1999-2000 closed.(The session is closed at 10:41 p.m.) Opening of the annual session I explain the session period 2000-2001 of the European Parliament to open.The agenda Mr. President, as the second item on the agenda for this morning we have the recommendation for the second reading of the cocoa and chocolate products for which I am the rapporteur.Yesterday at 8:30 p.m. I found out by chance that the coordination should take place today at noon.It seems to me, however, it was planned for tomorrow at noon.I am therefore completely unprepared and did not even have the opportunity to prepare the list of voting and check whether or not.As you know, this topic is quite controversial and also plays a major role in the media.I have been a member of this parliament for 10 years and have always been informed as a rapporteur when the order of voting has been changed.I would therefore ask that this vote will be postponed to tomorrow.This would solve my problem without, I believe, to affect someone, because it is a relatively short coordination.President!We have nothing against this shift in the vote.I just want to insist on the fact that the other votes that are intended, especially over the summit of Lisbon, will also take place tomorrow.Under this condition we have nothing against the shift.According to the communication of the responsible departments, the list of the upcoming votes tomorrow is quite long.President!Like Mr. Lannoye, I was also surprised by the news last night that the vote on my report in second reading was also planned for 12 noon.The political groups urgently asked me to request them emphatically not to have the vote takes place at 12 noon, but tomorrow, since the political groups had no opportunity to apply for separate and namely votes.It was a big surprise that the vote was planned for 12 noon.In the name of many others, I would also like to ask to set the vote for tomorrow.Mr. Blokland, the officials of the responsible departments, let me know that your report is already provided for tomorrow's coordination.I now ask the plenum whether it agrees to postpone the vote on the Lannoye report.If so, this is considered agreed.Annual legislative program (continued) According to the agenda, the continuation of the pronunciation is followed by the annual legislative program of the European Commission for 2000. Mr. President, Mr. Commission President, my dear ladies and gentlemen!If the citizens of Europe are looking for this Europe, they are particularly looking for it in Brussels and especially the Commission.I am not happy as a parliamentarian, but at least I have to take note of it at the moment and until further notice.But that also means that an extremely challenge is on the commission.If you want to bring about the big turn that you, Mr. Commission President, have spoken, then you have to start damn quickly.	de
I am also happy to be able to confirm that I will take part in the next meeting of the parity assembly, which will take place in Nigeria in March.The Commission would like to assign a more important role to the parity assembly, especially with regard to the promotion of a more intensive political dialogue with our development partners.The Commission agrees to the rapporteur that combating poverty is still the most important goal of developmental policy and will always have a key role.In order to develop, however, the countries must be actively involved in the global economic system.As far as trading in our development partners is concerned, the Commission would like to guarantee that the special economic and social restrictions of the AKP countries will be taken into account with every new measure.Ms. Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmine system should be continued.I don't agree.This system has not proven to be effective, since it is actually only used very few of the 71 countries.I think it's too slow.It is therefore understandable that the developing countries welcome the new system because it will be more flexible.With regard to the future accession of countries for the Agreement of Lomé - z.B. from East Timor - I can only repeat what I recently said in the European Parliament Committee for Development and Cooperation, namely that the door is open.The applicants decide whether they want to knock.Then we take a stand.As for Cuba's application to join Lomé, the Commission notes that the AKP countries support Cuba's application according to their latest declaration.The EU has always been of the opinion that a constructive attitude is appropriate to Cuba, as is expressed in the common point of view of the EU.However, one has to admit that the negotiations will be difficult.As far as the ivory coast is concerned, I can say that the total amount of EUR 28 million has been repaid, as has been agreed after checking the irregularities.As for the financing of the European development fund through the budget, I can say that this is currently being checked.The Commission is for this, but we cannot provide any further information at the time and procedure at the present time.I can say about Article 366a that during the negotiations on a new partnership agreement, a new procedure for the treatment of violations of human rights, the democratic principles and the rule of law was introduced.What it looks like at the moment, the parliament will be informed about all decisions on the basis of Article 300 on the basis of Article 300, and the Commission will continue to observe the decisions of the parliament in this matter.It is not intended to apply the approval process in parliament in connection with such decisions.This would be necessary to change the recently decided contract of Amsterdam.Finally, a note on the South Africa agreement, which was also mentioned by the rapporteur.I am happy - I would almost like to say that I am happy - to be able to tell you this evening at the end of this discussion that the South African President today promised the solution to open problems, as South Africa was proposed by the EU Foreign Ministers last Monday.	de
"(The Parliament approves the Legislative Resolution) Report (A5-0019/2000) of Mr. Di Pietro, on behalf of the Commission for Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Internal Affairs, on the Project of Act of the Council by which the agreement relating to judicial assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union (9636/1999-C5-0091/1999 and SN is concluded5060/1999 - C5-0331/1999 - 1999/0809 (CNS)) Before the vote Lady President, I would like to denounce the absence of the presidency in the exercise of the Council.I believe that in these matters of the third pillar, in these important conventions for the construction of that space for freedom, security and justice, it is not a receipt that the presidency is not in the exercise of the Council here today.And then, Mrs. President, I would like to talk about the problem of translations.I will give only one example because we do not have time, but this is a case in which translations are very important because they are all very precise legal concepts.In the amendment 83 in Italian, which is the original, it is said that ""Il Minore Deve Essere Assistito gives a person of a fiducia or gives an expert or legale sterno.""This ""Legale Esterno"", in the French version, becomes an ""Avocat Neutre"", and I don't know what an ""Avocat Neutre"" is.I think it is a contradiction in terminis.But, in the Spanish version, the lawyer disappears, there is no lawyer.Mrs. President - you said it several times-, this is a very serious problem.In this matter, I believe that linguist jurists must do a very thorough job to reach a version that is reasonable.Completely agree, Mrs. Palacio Vallelersundi, is not the first time this happens and, in effect, is very worrying.We will study this problem and check all translations.Mrs. President, I just wanted to join my voice to that of Mrs. Vallelersundi Palace before the vote begins, to say that the absence of the Council in this debate is deeply regretted, when such important votes are held on the third pillar.I would like to beg her, Mrs. President, who expresses to the Council our desire that in the future attends like this.I totally agree, I am aware that your absence is not normal, and I will transmit it.On the amendment 31 Mrs. President, I would like to add that in the phrase member - I'm going to read it in French which is the version that I have here on hand - I am required to be droit of l'état quneage required ou requérant that the personne donne are consentiment.Add the words ""par le droit de l'état qumbre require ou requérant"".(Parliament approves the legislative resolution) Mrs. President, I just want to say that, in the heat of the previous situation, I have forgotten to tell him that, in my report on deficit, in the last paragraph, in the Spanish version there is a incorrectness: instead of saying that ""the proposal seems correct to us"", it has forgotten a ""S"" and says ""the proposal does not seem correct"", which is just the opposite.It was to correct that, not for anything else.Resolution proposal (B5-0132/2000) presented by Mrs. Bonino, among others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the communication of the Commission on the strategic objectives for five years"	es
This must contain minimum requirements with regard to the age and properties of the ships for access to the waters and ports of the community, also a general environmental liability principle that enables a clear determination of the liability of the individual actors, in particular the agony, and the hard punishment of violations.The Commission must pay attention to the coordination of information activity, must not shy away from disputes about the negligence of certain large ports or shipowners and must focus on the question of low -cost flags at the center of the negotiations with Malta and Cyprus.I would like to remind you that the Erika was registered in La Valetta.However, the states must not pass their own responsibility to the Union, because the accuracy and effectiveness (and thus the means) of the port control depends on the safety of everyone.We have to and will be particularly vigilant in the coming months to ensure that the victims, who undoubtedly do not affect the slightest complicity of this catastrophe, are completely compensated by the cause and thus really the teachings with regard to marine safety are really pulled out of the oil spill, so that the polluters are finally put off by the lives of our people in the coastal regions.The most effective prevention is given if every potential cause threatens the hardest financial punishments.Report Katiforis (A5-0017/2000) We agree that fishing is one of the economic areas with the greatest interest in protecting the marine environment.However, one must invoice that many causes contribute to the damage to the marine environment: pollution and contamination by oil tankers and other maritime traffic, industry, the pressure of man's activity on the coastal strips and of course the uncontrolled fishing.However, it should be emphasized that the small coastal fishing is a good example of how fishing can be reconciled with a sustainable and not destructive development for the world.We consider it possible to reconcile a policy of management of fishing stocks based on the conservation of the sea environment with the interests of the fishing sector.However, it must be taken into account, however, that there is an interdependency between the income from the fishing activity and the increase in fishing effort.As a result, measures must be taken within the framework of common fishing policy and corresponding financial resources must be provided that are suitable for securing the income of those who live exclusively from fishing, especially in times of standstill or reducing fishing.This results in the importance of the proposals we have made with this goal.In the Commission's communication, a number of goals and suggestions are listed in which the need to continue the efforts in the area of ​​control and surveillance, to enact new technical measures with regard to the selectivity of the catching procedures, to check the application of the legal provisions, among other things.In its communication, however, the Commission reveals at the same time that it does not see itself able to enforce compliance with these legal provisions.There is no lack of existing measures and suitable means, because the Commission has a whole range of binding regulations, measures and decisions (international and community origin) for the areas of fishing and protection of the marine environment.	de
Unlike Ms. Kaufmann, I am not for strengthening control over the European Central Bank because I am for the independence of this bank.But on the political level, control must be established appropriately.It is also a question of setting up the Triangle Commission, Council and Parliament in the field of foreign and security policy, a domain where everything is far too concentrated on the only side of the Council, and to particularly look at the primitive measures to manage crisis for which the skills are incumbent on the commission alone.All this has not been sufficiently included in this general concept.We must examine whether changes are necessary for this purpose as part of the intergovernmental conference.The Portuguese Presidency of the Council said that it would start reflections on this subject in order to consider an extension of the mandate.I would still like to point out another important point.The debates that we are carrying out these days, for example, on the government of a European country, still show that we must establish that the European Union has an intellectual and moral orientation and aims at the rule of law, the community and the common good and that restrictive fundamental rights must therefore also be incorporated into the treaty because this will constitute an important stabilizer.I pray to those who still show large reservations in this area to wonder if the time has not come to perceive this link and to show the necessary courage in order to reach the advances which are imposed in the field of fundamental rights.The European Union does not need - or little of them - new instruments, it does not need new skills.What she needs are the instruments allowing her to use her skills.This is why we must ensure that the instruments work in such a way that we can pay, in the name of the citizen, the tasks which are now formally entrusted to us by the Treaty.I think it is on this point that the efforts of this intergovernmental conference should be particularly concentrated.If we manage to progress in this area, we will also be able to consider the historic mission of the widening of the European Union.This is what the decisive emphasis must be put.I am convinced that, under your direction, dear presidency of the council, this element will evolve positively.Mr. Chairman of the Council, you understood by listening to various interventions that the idea of ​​trusting the Portuguese presidency, not to increase the task by putting the start of the intergovernmental conference later prevailed, not without contrast, within the Commission for Constitutional Affairs and at the level of the presidents of the political groups of this Parliament.I can assure you that it was not easy to do it last week, in the commission that I chair but, ultimately, we decided to bet on the Portuguese presidency and we would like to win this bet.	fr
"Dialogue on Europe: challenges of institutional reform The agenda calls for the communication of the Commission - ""Dialogue on Europe: challenges of institutional reform"".Mr. President, Ladies, Messrs deputies, the commission is currently being debated and he is very necessary to make his work over today.So I come essentially to talk to you, as indicated to you on the agenda of your assembly, of a new initiative that the Commission offers to provide its answer, which is not the only answer, to a great challenge which must mobilize all the actors of European construction, at the forefront of which are naturally the parliamentarians that you are, but also the commissioner that I am, but also the ministers who sit on the council and the national parliamentarians andcivil servants who work in our various institutions and who are committed and motivated by this European construction.This morning, in the long debate to which I attended alongside the Prodi President, many of you mentioned the democratic deficit, the distance from the European institutions.By saying this, I am not only trying to ask the question - one of you said it with great clarity and strength: Who does what?And it is the least of things that citizens understand that what does our different institutions do.The question is immediately also to know what we do together and what we want to do together in the future, especially with the countries that will join us.Thus, this democratic deficit also challenges us and that is the reason why, the very day after the opening of the intergovernmental conference, during which I will have the honor of representing the commission alongside Mr. Prodi, and by working, I repeat, in close confidence with your two representatives, Mr. Brok and Mr. Tsatsos, we decided, earlier, to launch ""Europe and on Europe "", to take our share in this direct contact with citizens.All the commissioners have committed themselves, each time they have to go to a country, and not only to their country of origin, in a region - for my part, it happens to me three or four times a month - to devote a moment of their schedule to a direct dialogue with citizens, not only with the elites or institutional managers that one usually meets, to also establish direct contact, in a high school, in a high school,Go into contact with people, answer questions and listen.This will therefore be the part that we will take, as you will take it yourself, to this necessary effort, to this ardent obligation, which consists in reducing the democratic deficit, that is to say the remoteness of citizens in relation to what we do.This initiative, we want to lead it in cooperation with the Member States, in conjunction with the European Parliament.We will make a regular synthesis, so that the state of opinion is well measured and that one can adjust or redirect.We also wish to lead it in consultation with national parliaments, local elected officials, non-governmental organizations, socio-professional environments and the media.Relays of opinion, political groups and parties, European, national parliamentarians, elected officials, I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of Regions, the Economic and Social Committee and Civil Society organizations, the university environments will be concerned."	fr
I can tell you, the value of the colleague that the Presidium has in principle decided to publish a register in which the MPs have to state their financial interests on the Internet and the quäds are to examine the associated legal questions.However, a decision can be expected shortly.(The parliament approves the protocol.) Reform of the Commission on the agenda follows the Commission's communication on the reform of the European Commission.I give the word to the President of the Commission Romano Prodi.Ms. President, ladies and gentlemen!In July last year I solemnly took on the commission's reform here before you.I would like to briefly remember what happened in July at the time: the crisis of the previous commission had led to its resignation, I had just been appointed commission president, and they had agreed to this appointment.The highlight of this was the commission that I have taken over by the commission: a thorough reform that must lead to a real revolution in the working method of the Commission.This obligation was finally redeemed today: the reform is presented to you here, in a well -structured white book that has just been assumed by the Commission.I would like to emphasize that the Commission has decided unanimously in this case, with one voice.What are the focus of this reform?First: Determination of the political priorities and, by a targeted use of the resources, their implementation of their concrete actions.This is the key point of the system, because with the help of the priorities and the targeted use of the resources, politics will enforce its leading role and fully assume its responsibility.For this purpose, we have developed a new mechanism completely new in political program planning: a system that enables the Commission to determine annual political guidelines, then on the basis of which the household procedure and to determine concrete goals for the general directorates and - which is of crucial importance - to keep the relationship between available resources and assigned tasks under control.Under this perspective, measures -related management is the key instrument to ensure that goals, activities and resources are coordinated.The second point concerns human resources.They are the support of our actions: the staff is our actual capital, the capital of the Commission.This staff has extremely high qualities, such as you can rarely - or not at all - be found in the individual administrations of the Member States because of our attitude procedures and criteria.I saw this impression that I had won when I started the commission presidency during my daily work.Nevertheless, I found at the same time that there is a very bad mood among the administrative staff: While you used to be proud and happy to belong to one of the institution admired from all sides, you are now demoralized due to the months of criticism.All of this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform.Settings policy, career development, mobility, disciplinary procedures, all of this is regulated according to completely new criteria: stronger consideration of individual merits, credible and, above all, verifiable assessment systems, constant further training and more responsibility for managers.We will be active in these areas.The third point, which is also quite delicate and played an essential role in the crisis behind us, is financial management.	de
"Mr. President, to intervene lastly gives me the privilege, Mr. Commissioner, to tell you that this assembly is mainly favorable to your initiative and has shown that it had total confidence completely justified, in my opinion in the way you govern this boat.But, since we are in the same boat, we want to row too.This is the reason why I believe that it is absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue to arrive safely, tin and qualify this very important reform.The many ideas that have been exhibited in this assembly could be divided into three main categories.First, some deputies and, in particular, Ms. Randzio-Plath, president of the Economic and Monetary Commission, are concerned whether this new legal exception system will be absolutely compatible with the Treaty.I share their concern and think that we have to examine this aspect.Second, the question of the legal security of companies arises.It is true, Mr. Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty.We all agree.But it is nonetheless true and all the groups of this assembly repeated it that the European industrial fabric is a fabric of small and medium -sized enterprises and that the Commission often plays a role of auctoritas, legitimization, legitimacy, of the domestic market.In this regard, I wish to express my opinion on the remarks made by Mr. Karas.There was only nine rejection decisions.But there, I will talk about my experience as a lawyer.How many times a lawyer with two companies and a project does not change this project, faced with an orientation of the ex ante commission, so that it is in accordance with these competition rules!This is an aspect that must be taken into account.Third, the problem of the uniform application of Community law arises.On this point, there is nothing to add to the excellent intervention of Ms. Thyssen.If biodiversity and cultural diversity are, in my opinion, a good thing, it is not the same for the diversity of application of the law, of what constitutes the essential nucleus of the internal market, namely, the law of competition.This point must still be tinned.Only some countries, such as Germany, have a specialized court.Perhaps it is a way to explore, but we need to explore others.What we cannot do, Mr. Commissioner and I would like to finish there is to lend the flank, to provide weapons to those who present European institutions as a case for the big, the powerful, the rich, and not for the citizens, the small and medium -sized enterprises, who would be subjected, in the worst case which will never materialize because the sufficient measures will be applied to avoid this situationDissemblables, very late and without any real possibility of controlling the situation if not by doing what the French call ""the obstacle course"", namely while waiting for I only know how many years the Luxembourg Court, which, as we know, is currently saturated, renders its judgment."	fr
I believe that the president of the Italian council spoke of this point during your interview on February 24.Can you tell us what is your position on this subject?Mr. President, Europe has been awakened with a start by Bosnia and Kosovo.The European Union finally realizes that it cannot afford to constantly let the Americans take political and military initiatives.The decision to set up an autonomous peacekeeping force is excellent.However, if Europe wishes to be able to intervene militarily in critical moments, a flexibility clause in the treaty must be provided.Mr. Solana can play a decisive role.It is not crazy, I can assure you!He is a passionate and competent man.It's just about knowing whether this accumulation of functions does not go beyond the skills.Mr. Solana is not only secretary general of the Council but also secretary general of the EUO, a high representative for foreign policy and head of the planning and rapid alert unit.Does So Solana still find time to sleep, Mr. President?To tell the truth, I find this accumulation of unacceptable functions from a democratic point of view, especially since Mr. Solana was not democratically elected: it is a senior official who has no accounts to be rendered to any parliament.His situation threatens to overshadow Commissioner Patten, as we have seen again today.Obviously, as the European security and defense policy takes shape, the Commission and the Parliament are less and less involved.I find this situation just as unacceptable.It is of course necessary to put everything to improve the effectiveness of European policy, but this cannot lead to unwanted concentrations of power.Solana must hold the eyes of Europe wide open without falling into sleep itself.Mr. President, the European Union was created above all to guarantee peace and I am satisfied that Commissioner Patten and Mr. Solana also underlined him several times.We have also opted for joint development, through the paths of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance.Today, however, we are powerless in the face of misfortune in Chechnya and indifferent to the wars that occur in Africa, in a large number of countries with which we have links since they are former colonies.They are part of our ACP partners.War is the continuity of decadent underdevelopment.We intervened militarily in Kosovo after being unable to prevent a war from breaking into the former Yugoslavia.Today, we are unable to maintain peace there.This is the reason why the European Union is not credible.I do not believe, Mr. Solana, that we can restore this credibility by the military route.As representatives of the European Free Alliance, we are all from nations, regions, who have never waged war with a foreign country but who have always had to defend themselves against their attackers.We are very skeptical about your current rapid training plans of an armed force, not because we would be opposed to a European defense, but because this defense should and can only result from an effective and democratic decision -making process.	fr
With regard to the type of projects to be promoted, one should also relocate the focus of small projects on earnings base, which are difficult to monitor, to investment projects in which the benefits are obvious in the majority of cases.This means that the calls can be met after more transparency when using the funds, and the temptation, the local tax revenue in areas in which corresponding projects are carried out unnecessarily over a long period of time is successfully counteracted.In addition, the parliament makes it clear how serious it takes the call for such reforms.These changes, if they are accepted by this high house today, are in my opinion another decisive step to achieve the historically significant goals, for which the funds had originally been set up, namely the financially sustainable support of the disadvantaged areas in the European Union in which the standard of living does not have to be raised by alms, but concrete help to a decent level.I ask the house to agree to these changes.President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for her report developed with so much diligence and care.The structural policies and the cohesion policy of the European Union are undoubtedly the essential instruments in order to create the prerequisites for growth and reducing economic and social imbalances in the regions.Despite the previous measures, these imbalances are still quite pronounced, even unacceptable in terms of unemployment.In order for the goals of these politics to be implemented as comprehensively as possible, they must be coordinated and implemented on the basis of well -thought -out, sensible guidelines.Let us not forget that these policies, if they are effective, also become visible to the European citizen who recognizes an immediate improvement in his quality of life!We also consider that the remote and island regions of the European Union deserve special attention, because due to their geographical situation, they are considerably disadvantaged in their economic and social development - unless the commission intends to build bridges or to create a tunnel tunnel to connect them to the European mainland.Finally, let me note that the structural policies overall have to be made more flexible so that they meet the changed conditions and thus the new challenges and opportunities that the new millennium, for which we all hope the best, brings with it.Mr. President, Ms. Schroedter's report, undoubtedly contains numerous important information, and I would like to congratulate her.However, we should have the focus and the results of the regional policy of the community.Here are some problems: the enormous mass unemployment is not only not broken down, but also accepts worse dimensions within the framework of structural policy.As a result of the regional policy practiced, agriculture and agricultural regions suffer irreparable damage, which has ominous consequences for the employment in rural areas and the living conditions of farmers, especially in the south.The regional imbalances within the Member States potentiate in a scary manner.Based on the data of the sixth report, it becomes clear that the regional gradient has increased significantly in the past ten years.The enormous problems of the island regions of the Union, where the deficits in the infrastructure, traffic, communication and energy sectors lead to a continuous emigration of the population, almost no or no attention is paid at all.	de
Based on this fixed point of view, we also consider the time to demand increased efforts by the Commission and the Member States on behalf of those who are now drowning in Mozambique.The one million euros made available is completely insufficient for the need for $ 65 million by the Mozambican government.The time has also come to demand more effectiveness.We hope that the debate, which was conducted this early afternoon, will lead to greater efforts for all pages in the help of Mozambique.President!The situation in Mozambique is of extreme drama.Every day, every hour of delay costs a lot of lives.There are only a few helicopters available for the rescue of tens of thousands of victims.The water increases inexorably.Farming and epidemics threaten.It looks as if the whole world watch out.The question is whether the Commission reacts quickly enough.To be honest, I have my doubts.Commissioner Nielson left to Mozambique today.This may be quick for European terms, but maybe very late for the emergency in Mozambique.In contrast to a number of member states, the European Union has so far only promised support to a very limited extent.What options does the Commission see to offer effective help quickly?What could immediate aid and the support for reconstruction look like?What can Commissioner Patten say about the previous international coordination?Why was it not possible to offer a larger number of helicopter rescue at an earlier point in time?The international community could certainly help Mozambique with generous debt.Not only because the country runs a relatively good policy, but above all because the extent of the human misery absolutely requires this.President!All reports and pictures that reach us are testified by the extent of the tragedy, which is affected by the Mozambique.Hundreds of thousands of people torn from their surroundings, numerous dead, a lack of food and drinking water, destroyed houses and harvest.And all of this in a country that is one of the poorest in the world and therefore does not have the slightest means to get the affected population groups with the necessary speed.Therefore, an intervention by the European Union and the corresponding Member States is imperative so that this country and this population are helped quickly and unscheduled.As is well known, the Portuguese presidency and Mr. Commissioner Nielson have come to Mozambique due to the drama of the situation.We are pleased with that.But even more than your presence there, it is urgently needed to immediately decide and implement a short and medium-term action program and to carry out in cooperation with the Mozambican bodies with which the help that requires the situation.Incidentally, today I have in this sense and in the conviction that it is now required to be quick and unusual to act, before your departure in my capacity as chairman of the committee for development and cooperation to Mr. Commissioner Nielson and asked him to sit down with us immediately after his return and to inform us about the development of the situation and especially about the immediate measures that have already been taken by the European Union.	de
"In the future - and this is already the case today - retirees will have considerable sums of money.Unlike the young people who are closed, the elderly have raised a capital they want to make fruit and they therefore have interest in this directive.If national governments attached importance - as the European Union attaches it in this directive - to the multiplication of money earned during professional life, the explosive problem of pensions would have already been resolved.Mr. Bolkestein, in your capacity as a commissioner, you carry a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and retirees, a future which, I hope, will be better once we have developed this directive, namely very soon, as Ms. Villiers and Kauppi proposed.Mr. President, that it was first allowed to me, on behalf of the Commission, to send my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Olle Schmidt, and to the members of the Economic and Monetary Commission, seized on the merits, as well as to the Rapporteur, Brian Crowley, and to the members of the Legal Commission and the internal market that I would like to thank for their activity as detailed as it is important in order to refine and expand proposals.Since the approval of Directive 85/611, the investment fund sector has experienced a long development and it is now important to modernize its rules.The new proposals aim at a maximum level of protection of investors, which forms an essential condition for the integration of markets which stems from the introduction of the euro.Given that the average European family places its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions in terms of prudent management - and I want to insist on this point - cautious management with regard to the investment and risk distribution policy.The two proposals form a coherent whole.The first proposal expands the number of instruments in which a ""collective placement organization of securities"" - an UCITS - can invest.As has already been noted in this assembly, UCITS are among the major players in the modern capital markets.Their presence offers the possibility for a large number of traditional investors to take part in these markets, taking into account the principle of distribution of risks accompanied by adequate control.Diversified investment forms being authorized, private investors can also take advantage of all the advantages of new investment techniques.The second proposal expands the role that these important intermediate institutions can play in the European Union capital markets with regard to the development of the investment fund sector.If we authorize the constitution of branches and the establishment of certain services on the cross -border level, these institutions will finally be able to use freedoms granted by the Treaty of Rome which they were deprived during all these years.The Commission welcomes a number of clarifications proposed by the Economic and Monetary Commission and will resume a large number of its ideas.The Commission will take up the amendments - and I use the numbering in its most recent form - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 in the first proposal and 23, 28 and 32 to the second proposal, since they are very useful clarifications and improvements."	fr
Finally, I would like to underline that it is also convenient to take note - for having been one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency program - of the statement that it is necessary to value development policy within the framework of the policies of the European Union and in particular in that of its foreign policy.We believe that it is absolutely indispensable, under penalty of failing to carry out any consistent action in the field of policy coherence, if we are not able to give the relief that development policies must charge as an instrument of affirmation of principles and values ​​that model the insertion of Europe into the international system.For that, it will be necessary, at the time, as I have underlined, change the paradigm or leave behind the post -colonial paradigm so that development policies charge a European dimension.I believe in that regard (and some interventions have also indicated it here) that the approval of the new agreement that replaces the Lomé Agreements is an important instrument of renewal of a new dynamic in the approach of cooperation with such an important group of countries in the south at a time when the considerable instability existing around international negotiation processes such as those that occurred around the first round of negotiation of negotiation of negotiation of negotiation of negotiation of negotiation of negotiation of negotiation of negotiation.Seattle..(En) In many of the contributions to this debate it seems to me to perceive a certain degree of frustration.I have formulated before you a statement in the name of the commission that in my opinion provides a useful basis for this debate.We will facilitate more detailed information that dealt directly with all issues related to coherence.This debate is not new.We are currently working on this issue in the Commission and once that work has ended up informing him, since there have been numerous ones who have asked them to be facilitated by the report on coherence.I have no doubt that as a result of the growing political attention that raises these problems - something that is clearly reflected in today's debate - it will be easier for the commission and for the development DG to include coherence on the first page of our work program.This also requires the introduction of other new mechanisms in the commission system that can very well include, as some of the political groups of Parliament, the establishment of a special work group in which several services are represented and the establishment of a kind of watchtower of coherence in the commission have suggested.I have read - and I have heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as a kind of panacea that is worth everything.It seems to me that it is important to keep coherence as a defined and relatively clear discipline that tries to correct inconsistencies when they really exist, and there is no doubt that in our case they exist.Much of this is due to true disagreements between the sectoral sectors of each Member State, as has been said with fullness in this Parliament: people tend to identify more or less with their interest spheres, which otherwise is legitimate.	es
"If the FIPOL ceiling is insufficient, and it obviously underestimated, it must be increased.Our resolution requests it.If the increase is insufficient, the polluter will have to finance the balance.It would be particularly unfair to see an oil company, whose profits are rising this year at ten billion francs, refusing to compensate its own victims 100 %, the vast majority of which are made up of small businesses and employees.The populations experienced, the Commissioner, are waiting for the European solidarity brands to be manifested at the European level.Our resolution asks the Commission to take necessary measures to help repair the damage caused in the fishing sector affected by the consequences of the disaster.Bleue Europe, the PCP, must show today that, beyond the constraints it inflicts on fishermen, solidarity is not a word that it ignores.The European Union must also participate in the restoration of environments in wetlands and affected coastal areas whose biological value interests the entire Union.Mr. Fischler has just told us that he would welcome France's requests and I welcome it.We have, in this essential file of marine pollution, to play a role of sting.Twenty after the AMOCO Cadiz disaster, it is indeed always laxity and irresponsibility that reign supreme in Europe in terms of maritime security, with their fruits, new black tides.This time, inertia should not prevail.A general framework in terms of maritime security must be quickly defined by respecting the principle of subsidiarity, and it must finally be put an end to this infernal spiral of generalized irresponsibility.Mr. President, the economy of the Western Atlantic is disaster, Mazoutée by the fuel of the Erika.Fishermen, oyster farmers, conchyls, tourism professionals, local and territorial communities are getting impatient while waiting for aid and the treatment of the wreckage which, apparently, always flees and constitutes a real time bomb.Europe, which has unfortunately removed the budget line, ""natural disasters for the benefit of member countries"", must react.React first in the name of solidarity, but also in the name of its share of responsibility in this umpteenth black tide.Indeed, citizens do not understand why Europe accepts what Americans refuse and why Europe, usually so quick to legislate in terms of environment, has so far ignored maritime security.Europe must legislate as soon as possible and shed light on this sinking.But in the meantime, the Commission must urgently mobilize European funds to help disaster companies, treat the wreckage, clean the coast, increase waste storage capacity, ensure their treatment or recycling, establish a research program on oil collection at sea. Finally, the Commission must restore a substantial budget line, ""natural disasters for member countries"", make the structural funds.What is the opinion of the Commission on these proposals?What are the decisions already made and those that the commission intends to take?"	fr
For this reason, radical reforms are needed and, therefore, a wider program for the CIG.The Finnish presidency listened only to the proponents of the minimalist approach, while ignored - unfortunately - the opinion of Parliament.Portugal has the opportunity to learn from its Finnish predecessor what should not be done.It is vital that Parliament and the Commission are involved in this CIG.In many areas these two institutions share common interests and positions.An effective assessment of this common commitment will have to coincide, in any case, with the right of Parliament to approve the next changes of the Treaty.Among all the priorities this is the most important.What is the commission's opinion in this regard?This also means that the president of our Parliament and the other two political representatives will have to be able to participate on the same political plan of the Commission, not only, therefore, within a working group.There is no reason why the representatives elected directly by citizens must be relegated to the background compared to the Commission.Radical reforms represent a commitment that we must take on for the new Member States, but also for ourselves.If we let Europe weaken following the expansion, we will sink into our political swamp.Mr. President, for days I haven't understood this parliament for days that seems to have a masochistic taste for self -compliance.After limiting its participation in the CIG to two miserable seats as its initiative, the Parliament today renounces to complete the agenda of the conference.In fact, whether for weakness or for stupidity - and none of these alternatives appears glorifying -, this classroom is falling to give their opinion and thus renounce the only command tool conferred on it by the Treaty, that is, to renounce to demand that a complete agenda will be provided before pronounced.Why should we vote for this opinion tomorrow, February 3, with the urgency procedure, when we could wait for the opening of the Strasbourg session, on February 14, and in a force position could we impose on the Council a complete and therefore coherent agenda to the Council?It takes a good dose of hypocrisy to mask the weakness of which we try today.It takes hypocrisy to regret bitterly, in the resolution, that the agenda of the cig is not at the height of future challenges, when we impose ourselves short times with a guilty naivety and we prevent ourselves from imposing a more ambitious agenda.If empty empty of democracy will be highlighted at the end of the CIG, the fault will be of the political groups who wanted this hasty participation.Whether you want it or not, the decision -making headquarters now moves to the fifteen Member States, since Parliament has turned off the only glow that allowed him to make some light in the discussions.I therefore turn to the deputies of the vast majority of Parliament - who in November decided that the future of Europe deserved a wider debate that was not the residue of Amsterdam - so that they argos of good will and activate at their governments to convince them of the need to expand the CIG, a possibility, however, provided for in the resolution of the Helsinki Council.	it
Mr Poos, please apologize.Just on the point of his question there was a certain lack of clarity.Regarding Meda, Malta and Cyprus they can participate in regional programs, but not in specific ones by country, since income are too high.Thank you very much, Commissioner Verheugen.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday.TIME OF QUESTIONS (Council) Question n.1, of the honorable (H-0022/00): object: control of the access of oil tankers in the community waters in relation to the accident of the Erika oil tanker near the French coast, which has given rise to a black tide, what measures it intends to adopt the advice to control the access to the community waters of oil tanks.Mr President, honorable parliamentarians, the Council, on January 24, dealt with the consequences of the shipwreck of the oil tanker Erika, which took place the previous month.On that occasion, the Council, making the emotion of public opinion for the disastrous effects of this event its own, has expressed its concerns regarding the safety of the oil tankers and the environmental protection linked to it.The advice has not remained insensitive to this kind of problems and the need to adopt complementary measures in this regard.On that occasion it was emphasized that it was important that the Council adopted new measures both at the Community level and in the context of its activity at international organizations.As is known, at present, community legislation obliges port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign ships, including those that beat flags of convenience, and to block them in case of failure to fulfill international standards.There is a 1995 directive in this regard.As for the future, the Council has taken note of the fact that the process of reflection in progress within the Commission should end between not much with a communication on the safety of the oil tankers and with new proposals aimed at strengthening the controls, as well as the qualifications of the inspection bodies.The need for strengthening of the structures of the oil tankers who attend community ports is also foreseen.This problem is followed by the Council of Transport Ministers and, therefore, I can inform you on behalf of the Council that we will not fail to give the utmost priority to the proposals that the Commission, as everything indicates, will present in this context, which seems essential to us, on environmental protection.Of course, Parliament will also be called to pronounce on these proposals, given that they are subjects subject to codecision.I am pleased to the fact that the advice considers my question as an object of reflection.The president in office of the Council comes from Portugal, a country directly threatened by a situation of this type.If we reflect too long, however, it could happen that, from here to the next summer, a oil tanker in similar conditions is embodied in front of the Algarve and anniversary the Portuguese summer tourist industry;That, if this is fate, marine currents bring pollution to the island of Madera - because they go in that direction - and also compromise the tourism of the Canaries.	it
The Commission insists on the need to examine the said requests from the point of view of their safety and their effectiveness before granting an authorization.I can only ask you again to keep in mind the technical nature of the commission proposal and to wait for the independent proposal for a new directive concerning the additives in food to approach larger questions.I would like to examine some of the specific problems that have been raised during the debate.First of all, with regard to the observations made by Mr. Graefe Zu Baringdorf, I would like to ensure that we will modify the authorization procedure for genetically modified additives in Directive 70/524 concerning additives and not in the Novel Food directive.It is a directive whose object concerns more particularly raw materials than additives.The text mentioned by the Parliament comes from the directive which was adopted in 1998. However, the vertical legislation of Directive 90/220 relating to the way of evaluating the environmental risks of GMOs has been modified since then and is still today.It is subject to the second reading in Parliament.I am convinced that we should wait for the final version of Directive 90/220 and more particularly, from its article 11. It has also been referred to the question of whether this proposal could generate a risk of establishing monopolies.Mr. Kindermann and Mrs. Auroi raised this question.I would just like to make some comments on this question.First of all, this project has been in progress since 1993, and we cannot therefore say that it has taken short any other producer of goods.Indeed, any applicant of this type can always submit his request relating to a particular product.I also wish to underline the fact that the commission has never approved any request for authorization from GMOs intended to be included in additives.Ms. Roth-Behrendt referred to the question of the appropriate legal basis, namely whether this basis was to reside in article 37 or in article 152. Again, I repeat what I have already declared previously on this point and I assure it, as well as the Assembly, that it would be extremely inappropriate on the part of the Commission to seek a measure taken on the basis of article 37of the provision any reference to public health.It is a problem that has been examined on at least two times by the European Court of Justice, which established the legal criteria for situations identical to the present situation, which require the consideration of the appropriate legal basis at the time of the presentation of a legislative text.The courtyard of the court appears to be completely explicit on this point.As a general commentary on the amendments suggested here, particularly with regard to the problem of the legal basis, it would be inappropriate to base the legal basis on article 152 in these circumstances, because this would most certainly be likely to be contrary to the objective criteria that have been defined by the Court.A number of you - M. Nicholson in particular - have referred to the problem relating to labeling.	fr
The adoption of this report will have serious consequences for European agriculture if the concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen, for example, cannot exceed the basic values ​​for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a value close to zero is established for pesticides in the aquatic environment.European farmers will not be able, for example, no longer produce panic -up wheat containing a high level of protein for the manufacture of bread.This will result in a relocation of agricultural production to other countries outside the EU and there will be significant social costs as well as in terms of employment.I cannot accept the parts of the water directive concerning these points.Mr. President, dear colleagues, water is a precious resource.Millions of human beings do not even have pure water, an essential condition for survival.We must therefore not surprise that the water is at the base of wars.The capitalist world also places its pawns to take maximum control of water reserves.In this area, there is rarely about any general interest or solidarity.Europe is therefore confronted with a difficult task: to bring together community policy in the field of water in a more coherent legislative framework, fragmented both in terms of objectives and terms of means.I must admit that in my country too, Flanders, the road to go is still long.Recently again, the commission hit us on our fingers on this subject.Any sensible person wants this framework directive to be used as a sword in the kidneys of political leaders who are guilty of shortcomings at present.In this regard, the common position is a farce, an informal work, a real affront to the OSPAR agreements.We are faced with an implementation period which can be extended up to 34 years.My children will then be older than I am now.Recognize it: it's not serious.Tomorrow we can vote for a weak and informal framework that will poison the future of our children.Or, we will vote for the amendments of my group, the rapporteur or the environment commission.This is again to conclude.In recent months, we have exerted enormous pressure on us.What strikes in this case is the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers.In my country, it was done as well by the Flemish administration as Walloon in charge of the environment.They opted for the low common position rather than for the more ambitious positioning of our parliament.I really wonder if this approach is known to the green ministers of the environment in place in my country.Dear colleagues, the beautiful words are no longer enough.We must resolutely change CAP.During the vote of tomorrow, we can clearly show that Europe is working on a responsible and future policy in the field of water.This can only increase our credibility.The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.	fr
"The group of the European Party of Liberals and Democrats has adopted a position on the internal disintegration of the Union, approved last November, in which the creation in Europe of a system of concentric circles, ""the model of the onion"" was proposed.In its resolutions on the next CIG, Parliament must be fully applied in issues of internal differentiation and flexibility.The extension and the achievements achieved in integration will be threatened, if we are not able to create the concentric circles system proposed by the liberal group.My colleagues, Mrs. Frassoni and Mr. Urona have already intervened, with some skepticism, in relation to some aspects of the matter at hand.I want to add my voice of concern regarding the issue of subsidiarity, not only between the Union and the Member States, but between the Member States and their own autonomous communities.It is an issue that has not dedicated the attention it deserves and there are many aspects for which we must feel concern.Let me attract attention, in particular, on one of the repercussions of expansion in regards to this Parliament.The limit of 700 was established as the maximum of deputies that can constitute a parliament in which the deliberations of the Assembly are viable.If we apply the current principle of diffuse proportionality, six seats for each state and one more seat for every million inhabitants, we will have the situation in which Luxembourg, with a population of 367,000, will have more deputies in this assembly than the country of Wales, which is partly an autonomous community of the United Kingdom.Scotland, with a population of 5 million, currently has eight seats in this assembly;Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen.What will happen if we maintain the limit in 700, if over time a 26% more population is incorporated and then we approve the proposal, in my little meditated opinion, of the Commission, in the sense that there should be a European list of candidates?What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here?It will become totally invisible!In such circumstances, deputies to this Parliament should not be surprised in the slightest if in these negotiations, the population of Scotland and other similar countries ask if the extension should not also adopt the modality of admitting to new member states integrated into those already existing.In Scotland every day there are more those who support this point of view.Mr. President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is not, without a doubt, to affirm anything new.It has been repeated on many occasions.But this time it is true: we have launched - and it is something extraordinarily positive - the single currency and we have the extension in front.The question is: are we going to the extension prepared or not?Are we yet to expand without deepening or are we to expand deepening?That is the debate and towards that goes any discussion with respect to the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda and the method.It is evident that the Council, for the moment, has not opted to expand deepening.And that is dangerous for expansion.Dangerous for any perspective of political union and, of course, hardly understandable for public opinion."	es
It seems to me that there is a wide coincidence of opinions, however, in the Rapkay report there are comments that we must consider very carefully.I will point out only two of them for reasons of brevity.The first refers to a further increase in transparency.This Parliament knows Tastsa that we all consider the issue of transparency in the competence policy, and I personally, from the first day, on September 1, 1999, in which I appeared before the Commission of Economic and Monetary Affairs.Mr. Rapkay, with regard to the international dimension of the competence policy, I can confirm that the commission is willing to facilitate the Parliament a report on this issue with respect to which Mrs. Randzio-Plath also called us attention and in the scope of which I can say that we maintain very satisfactory bilateral relations with the homologous authorities of the United States, Canada and Japan and that we are working so that we are working for the world.of commerce, nazca a true Volet Competition.I also thank you very hot, Mr. Jonckheer for your report on the seventh report of state aid in the European Union.I do not address here the question of codecision, but not because I do not consider it important.It is very significant institutional importance that obviously goes beyond the specific issue of competition.Consequently, I have no right to pronounce myself and this issue belongs, obviously, to the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference.With regard to your suggestions, Mr. Jonckheer, you already know that my services are - despite the scarcity of resources, although very qualified, that characterizes them - working very actively in the elaboration of the registration of state aid and the indicator of state aid.I await with great interest the results of the seventh report whose planned deadlines are: creation of services now, in January, and approval of the commission in March 2000, to assess whether the last trends are confirmed.Messrs. Jonckheer, Thyssen and Gemelli have referred to the situation of preparation of candidate countries in the field of competence in general and in state of state aid.I can only say that we are working with them active and specifically.They are preparing, they all have competence laws and are instituting the corresponding authorities.As for the concerns in energy and especially environmental matters that, as they know, are also mine, I can say that we are finalizing the work of reviewing the incorporation of state aid in the environment.I also want to highlight in the context of the problems of state aids, the issue raised, among others, by Mrs. Riis-Jørgensen of the recovery of illegal aid.In April 1999, the Commission approved a new procedure regulation that introduces specific recovery rules.Throughout the coming months - I will assure it - they will verify to what extent we plan to take these rules seriously.Finally, Mr. President, a word to warmly thank Mr. Langen his report, whose purpose is more sector, but no less important in terms of contribution.	es
"This should be enough to demonstrate the topicality of the topic, but we can also mention the next summit between the European Union and OUA, finally set for next April, in Cairo.It should be added that any analysis, even superficial, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something, indeed much, does not go on the level of north-south relationships, including those between the European Union and the less developed countries.Just think that the number of the so -called less advanced countries has gone over the last thirty years from 25 to 48 and that the latter, while representing today 13 percent of humanity, only perform 0.4 percent of exports and 0.6 percent of world imports;or to the unhappy circumstance that the public help to development, promoted by rich countries, has decreased by about 23 percent.On the other hand, the recent cuts to the Community Budget carried out in this sector for this exercise are part of this trend, as well as constituting a negative and incorrect political signal.The unsuspected Mr. Camdessus, still director of the International Monetary Fund, said in the speech pronounced last Sunday at the opening of the works of the Uctod - I quote verbatim - that ""the international community with one hand gives and with the other takes away"".Obviously, the aid granted by the most advanced countries to those in development was referred.It looks like a joke, given the source from which it comes, but the affirmation was really made: I felt it myself.It is an observation that does not seem to me at all far from the current reality and pushes me to reiterate the need to rethink and relaunch the North-South relationships on new bases, or the need to review the role of the European Union in this context, because the promotion of a new more right and fair world order cannot and must not cease to represent a strategic objective of the Union;It is therefore essential to reflect on globalization in progress taking into account the essential orientations and dominant interests, in particular of the very serious negative effects it causes in developing countries.The conclusion of a new agreement with ACP countries is a fact.It is in itself a positive event, especially if you take into account the pressures exercised to end it and the fact that even several Member States were against going on on this path.We will have the way, in due course, to analyze the exact terms in which the agreement has been defined as thoroughly.However, it is certain that, although it contains unpublished and innovative elements, European negotiators were somewhat cautious and were held under the proposals that we had formulated at the time.The news consist of some characteristics of political relevance of the new partnership agreement.The latter is undoubtedly the result of a complex negotiation in which both parties have made substantial concessions, which is true regarding the European Union, especially in the field of good government and trade.But it was above all the result of the strengthening of the ACP group, which, apparently, after the Seattle summit found a new spirit.I would like to emphasize, in particular, that it seems to be about to be born a new way of dealing with problems, in particular in commercial matters, and that an adequate approach in this area is truly essential."	it
It is therefore probable that there are many forms of life up there, and that many of them are more advanced than ours.Recalling that the first television programs of the earth are now in the space of 50 light years from us, well beyond the closest stars, I invite you to imagine with me what the forms of life among the stars can think of us when they look at us.What do they see?They see a beautiful planet, full of life, but they see that its atmosphere is polluted and overheated.They see that the forests are demolished and the deserts expand.Living creatures can see that many animals are treated with cruelty and that rare ones are disappearing forever.How do they see the currently dominant species, that is, us?Well, they see that the resources of the planet are distributed unequally.They see that they are fighting for the territory, they see medicines capable of treating diseases, but not in the parts of the world where they are most necessary, school books, but not in the less advanced areas of our planet, where 50 percent of the world population does not make a phone call over life.How do they see the relationships between human beings?They see that we kill each other.They see that one limit the freedom of others.They see an endless series of local wars.They see some of our children called to arms as soldiers, or treated as prostitutes or slaves.They see men and women, individuals of different ages, minorities, people with the skin of another color, people of different race or religion, immigrants, even neighbors, suffer a discriminatory treatment.We all know the situation.The United Nations Human Rights Convention by 50 years ago was an attempt to correct the situation.We should honor her, and I think we do it.Only in Europe human rights are sanctioned by law.Here, within the European Parliament, some deputies do not want the right charter, currently subject to discussion, becoming applicable by law.I say: Shame!Human rights should be sanctioned by law in every country in the world.This is the goal we must tend to.As Commissioner Patten said, a lot remains to be done.Finally, if you ask me: if there was no form of life among the stars, and if we were alone?- A thought that arouses equally disturbing - I would say: don't you think that we have the responsibility to work for us so that our children behave correctly, before letting other planets go to populate?Mr President, human rights are universal, indivisible and connected and connected to each other.Many know this famous slogan by heart, taken up by the conclusions of the United Nations World Conference on human rights held in 1993. It is nice that this is the case.However, we must ask ourselves that it is of the policy of the European Union for Human Rights, if it reflects that unitary and homogeneous vision expressed by the aforementioned slogan.We must ask ourselves even if the European Union has or not a human rights policy.With the latter question I do not refer to the effort that costs the Member States mutually coordinate their positions on foreign policy and make a common front against human rights violations in other countries such as, for example, China.	it
"What I see throughout Europe is people drinking Coca Cola, eating hamburgers, wearing baseball caps, watching Hollywood movies and, often, doing all those things at the same time.Now, I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way to defend the culture of Europe, but I do believe in leaking a hand whenever we can.This is what the 2000 Culture Program intends. Therefore, I tell the Council of Ministers: they monitor this program.Is it enough what we are doing?And to Mrs. Reding I thank you for the support and help you have given so far and I encourage you to continue your good work;We are on your side.Mrs. President, I also want to congratulate the speaker, Mr. Graça Moura, and the Commissioner, Mrs. Reding, for her contribution to the achievement of this program.The ""Culture 2000"" program was definitely formed at the end of last year in the conciliation between Parliament and the Council.The final resolution can be considered acceptable, if we take into account that the approval of the program required the unanimity of the Council.It is desired that in the next CIG the qualified majority also also extend to the field of culture.It is truly unusual that the legislative provisions, whose process is submitted to the codecision procedure, require the unanimity of the Council.This Culture Framework Program replaces the current Caleidoscope, Ariane and Rafael programs.I would like that, once it is launched, all the possibilities that the program offers for the translation of books and literary works are used in its entirety.I hope and I think that, despite the avalanche of new technologies, literature will retain its range.We are in need of the depth that literature transmits us in a world of superficiality and inconstancy.In addition, literature is of great importance when transmitting our cultural tradition and increasing our mutual knowledge, as well as when watching out of wealth and linguistic plurality.In this context, it is very pleasant to point out that something after the official inauguration of the Socrates and Culture 2000 programs, which will take place in March in Lisbon on the occasion of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Portuguese Presidency will organize a meeting in which it will reflect on the situation of public libraries.I hope that this meeting also encourages the commission to actively take into account public libraries within the framework of the fifth program of the Information Society.Mrs. President, Mrs. Commissioner, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, in a way the circle of this agenda is closed.Today we have spoken a lot about Europe as a community of values, tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive attitude towards the process of expansion, openness and respect for others.The policies in the field of youth, education and culture constitute an important instrument to guarantee the respect of these values, to guarantee the trust of citizens in the European Union and to guarantee the credibility of the European Union before citizens."	es
"Unless you do not take care of the same access conditions for everyone to the postal services, but only think about the capital utilization conditions for companies in large agglomeration centers.However, MPs should be representatives of all citizens, and that means that they are obliged not to think economically but economically.This means specifically for postal services: First, the question of employment must have priority.I have nothing against liberalization and privatization, but the premises have to be right.Second, it must be guaranteed that there is no reduction in services for the citizen.Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this danger exists.Mr. Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which the prices after the liberalization have decidedly gone more strongly than in all other Member States of this European Union.This is also an effect that can arise.We have to make sure that this does not happen.Thirdly: Firstly, the universal postal service remains at a affordable price for every citizen, in every place, secondly, the retention of a unit price for all Member States, and thirdly, a daily postal delivery and collection on working days.In the question of the price-performance ratio for the respective weight classes of mailings, you can think about further price reductions;The Swiss Post itself says.One does not have to stay at over 300g, the analysis states that a minimum of 150g must be guaranteed so that this still pays off.I think the discussion was correct and important today so that Mr. Bolkestein knows how this parliament positions itself so that it can take into account things from the outset.President!In the first revision phase of Directive 97/67/EC, we are about postal services, and further liberalization, as I fear, would lead to a significant reduction in the services subject to the common good.At the hearing of Mr. Bolkestein, my colleague Véronique Mathieu said the wish that impact studies should be carried out for each proposal immediately after his announcement, so that the effects of the planned liberalization are known before the legal provisions are determined.What is the current state of affairs?Is the result of these impact studies available?As is well known, we, the EDD MPs, together with other members, defend life in rural areas, i.e. the preservation of jobs and the social cohesion, which is reinforced by the provision of a high-quality universal service.I would be happy to say that due to the examples to be determined daily in my country, in my very rural region, can be passed on to another liberalization phase without concern.Unfortunately, this is not the case, and if the European directive together with the French 35 -hour law that changes the working time criteria -for example 1,700 per hour is used to be processed in the hour compared to 1,400 -in our country either, the opening times for public transport are shortened, or certain post offices will be closed.This already means a unacceptable reduction in the service subject to the common good.I have the local newspaper of my community here, in which I read: ""The post office tells the population that from January 3, 2000 - this is very topical - the last emptying will take place at 3:45 p.m. and not as before""."	de
"I therefore believe that this point, which alone justifies an extended revision, must be registered urgently on the agenda of the CIG.In our opinion, the central questions that must currently be asked, with regard to the convocation of an intergovernmental conference for the revision of the treaties far exceed the controversy raised here concerning the dimension of its agenda, the possibility of formulating or not proposals of new subjects to be included or the level of participation of the Parliament.The important questions relate, in our view, on the possibilities and objectives of the CIG but also on the themes which will be debated there.We doubt his possibilities because it is that the objectives in sight are far from agreeing with the planned enlargement to which we keep referring.This is what emerges in particular from the content targeted, in particular with regard to the unrelated points in Amsterdam - which announced the subsequent formation of unacceptable directorates - but also with regard to those who refer to the second and third pillars, which begin to take place, particularly in the sense of an undesirable militarization of the European Union.These are several of the essential reasons for which we are not in favor of the proposal for resolution that we are now studying.The European Parliamentary Labour Group has abstained with regard to the final vote on the Leinen-Dimitrakopoulos report.The text is exaggeratedly ambitious and European deputies from the British Labor Party believe that the CIG should give priority to the Locks of Amsterdam in order to prepare the enlargement and should not extend beyond these objectives.Important work is currently underway in terms of reform and this must constitute, for the time being, priority in order to allow the consolidation and strengthening of EU institutions.The extension of the agenda and a drastic revision of the treaties would cause a risk of destabilization.The key element, in this text, as it was amended, is the appeal launched in favor of a charter of fundamental rights to be included in the treaties.In our view, this would cause a complex legislative charge and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter explaining to the citizens what their rights are.Our priorities must be: the number and responsibility of the commissioners The weighting of the vote within the council The extension of the qualified majority vote in the fields which will benefit in the United Kingdom and to Europe (but not the modifications of treatments, defense issues, border controls or taxation) and the extension of codecision in all areas to which the qualified majority vote is extended.Beyond that, we worry about what suggestions for ""flexibility"" and reinforced cooperation are not appropriate for the moment.Amsterdam's provisions, to a large extent, have not been put to the test and the fact of giving an increasing place to opt-outs could weaken the EU when we consider enlargement and where candidate countries are asked to subscribe to the single market and to the rest of European legislation..(SV) In order to influence development, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda of the intergovernmental conference that what emerges from this resolution, which, to too much extent, is concerned with the disappointment and negativism regarding the decision taken by the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999."	fr
Our report, as you know Signor Commissioner, defends the application of the codecision procedure to the basic legislation on state aid.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Ladies Colleagues, my part in today's discussion concerns the code on the aid to the steelurge.These are the state aid that in Europe have been granted on the basis of this code and that the Commission has examined.For 1998, it is a total of 27 cases, on which the Commission has developed its own report.The Czech treaty will arrive shortly.Precisely for this reason we have to deal above all how to manage aid for steelurge in the future.Parliament appreciates the decisions of the European Commission illustrated in the report, including that of requesting the return of funds in certain cases, thus applying article 88 of the Czech Treaty.The competitiveness of the European steel industry at the same time is also the subject of the recent communication of the Commission, of which we have not yet discussed in Parliament.As in other areas, the general ban on granting aid pursuant to article 87, paragraph 1 of the CE Treaty.Based on this article, state aid are substantially incompatible with the single market.Derogations are allowed only in well -defined cases.By virtue of article 88, the Commission is required to control state aid.In 1998 the main case was that of the contribution of capital to the Preussag in Germany for an amount of 540 million euros.In addition, Member States must communicate their aid projects to the Commission.The rules in force for the steel industry sector were established on 18 December 1996. They provide for the possibility of granting aid in favor of the steel industry only in certain well -defined cases.These are aid to research and development, to the protection of the environment, of social aid to encourage the closure of steel systems and aid for the definitive closure of non -competitive companies.In addition, there is a special legislation that grants up to 50 million euros in favor of a Member State, Greece.As can be ascertained, the practical management of the aid code to the steelurgee over the years has led to problems not completely dismissed in the relationship.From the point of view of Parliament it is important to speak today of derogations to be applied once this aid code to the steelurge is expired.Softening the current fundamental lines of the steel code is a hypothesis not to be excluded.Nobody wants to attend in Europe to an unbridled race to subsidies.This would strongly affect the single market despite the consolidation of the steel industry in recent years.Therefore Parliament considers it indispensable to change the code on the aid to the steelurgy also in consideration of the disparity of treatment feared by industry;The Commission must submit a new legislation to the Council.It is known that so far the Council has refused to approve this new legislation.This is also due to the thesis that, once the aid code to the steelurgee has expired, without the annoying control of the European Commission, one can return to do what you want.	it
The Van Hulten report represents progress, but it is not enough.In addition, we must clarify the roles that are ours in the field of account surveillance.The Court of Auditors must verify to what extent such or such element of the financial functioning of the EU could be incompatible with the regulations, but it does not amount to control the compliance of expenses with the objectives set.It is the European Parliament which is responsible for political evaluation.Our work is not to hunt for bandits - it is that of Olaf.Let me be told, for example, which national parliament obtains all the documents relating to prior surveys!I would therefore like to repeat, with all the obstinacy which I am capable of, that the provision on access to information and documentation must be significantly improved in relation to the text projects that we have been able to consult on the Internet, failing which this fight will not lead anywhere.Mr. President, I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteur for his report.I am happy to be able to contact him in Dutch, now that Mr. Van Den Berg did, otherwise I would probably have had some scruples.I find that this report brings a famous improvement, especially through amendments.I am part of the employment and social affairs committee and with us, a rapporteur is always proud to receive a hundred amendment proposals because it means that he has raised an interesting problem.I think that is the case in this case, although it is in my opinion exaggerated to extend too long over these hundred amendments.I will add that our coordinator to the budget control commission is Mr. Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and who has therefore made this debate a very considerable Spanish contribution.Mr. President, I find that there is one essential thing among the important elements that have been cited, it is the proposal to appoint a rapporteur for the Standing Committee for the Control of Public Administrations.It is a proposal of first importance.I am only surprising that the socialist group wants to eliminate this proposal by means of another proposal emanating from Ms. Morgan, because it actually wants to delete it completely.I don't understand where she is coming from.On the one hand, we hear all kinds of praises about the rapporteur and, simultaneously, Ms. Morgan wants to continue a sort of burnt earth strategy, both on this specific point but also on a certain number of other important points elsewhere, which has the effect of emptying its substance.I don't know if the goal is to meet Mr. Kinnock.In any case, I know Mr. Kinnock.Mr. Kinnock is willing to hear our expectations, but is just as ready to dismiss himself if he deems it useful.I can't find it really useful to use an extreme tactic like that of the burned earth.Finally, there remains the question of civil servants.I do not totally agree with Mr. Haarder, in fact.I share the opinion that the passage concerning civil servants is absolutely insufficient.This because, firstly, the accent was not put on the importance of a public service in general and, secondly, because there are all kinds of proposals which must be asked if they are judicious and if they will bring any improvement.	fr
The community can intervene in order to put local actors in contact so that they cannot, in fact, reinvent the wheel each in their region.We have an important role to play in the community, in the European Union, in this regard.SAVE is the only community program aimed at promoting rational energy use.It focuses on non -technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure;And the objective of this program is to create an environment promoting investments and energy efficiency.We must also realize here that there is a niche in the industry for energy savings.We have heard a lot about competition problems with regard to renewable energies, but energy efficiency makes it possible to save financial savings at business level, it allows financial savings everywhere and therefore, it should not create problems.We can all support this principle.I must say that, as for maternity, although we offer them our support, we sometimes do very little substantially and concretely to help mothers or people involved in energy savings.We could make much more given the major commitments we have made to reduce CO2 and greenhouse gases and reduce dependence on energy imports.We do not undertake the kind of actions that our citizens want.We do not establish the connection so that citizens can in fact achieve something concrete, whether at home or at the office or within the industry, to support actions aimed at combating global climate change.If we could communicate this, it would be very interesting to do so.Once again, I would like to thank all the people who contributed to this conciliation process.Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Ms. Ahern for her work as a rapporteur of this proposal, because she contributed, with the collaboration of other parliamentarians, to obtain a ultimately very reasonable result, even improving certain aspects of a proposal from the Commission and, of course, that the Council had accepted, at the very beginning, from a budgetary point of view.As Ms. Ahern said very well, both the budget of the Save program and that of the Altener program are more symbolic budgets, because the weight is supported by countries, the States of the Union, the regions, or even, in some cases, the municipalities.But in any case, it is not because its volume is relatively reduced that it no longer has the important symbolic value that the fact that there is a will in the whole of the community to support this kind of actions which contribute to what we actually take our commitments from Kyoto and, moreover, that we are reaching the diversification of our energy sources, the security of our supply and in the case of Save,Direct to less consumption, greater efficiency in the use of energy, thus helping to achieve the objectives set.In addition, concerning these programs, namely, the Save program, an increased efficiency and economy, and the Altener program, renewable energies, there is a very large technological challenge to be met, which from an economic point of view, can give rise to important possibilities for industry and also for the creation of employment in our countries and, therefore, throughout the Union.	fr
"I now briefly proceed to a review of the five subjects in which the most important changes are made.First, the changes to the delimitation, in the century 95, of the concept of the institutional sector of public administrations;This is important since public debt refers to what will be totaled by the set of public administrations.The fact of not having precise criteria for its definition would produce ""deviations"" in the public debt estimates of the various Member States.Secondly, the public debt or, possibly, the excess is equivalent to the balance called respectively of necessity or funding of the sector of public administrations of the century 95Fourth, the public debt is defined on the basis of the century 95, as well as the flows or interests deriving from that passive/active.In fifth and last place, the aggregate to which the public debt will refer will be the gross domestic product at current market prices, estimated on the basis of the definitions of the European accounts 95. Ultimately, it seems to me that the Commission's proposal represents a correct and concrete adaptation of the criteria established in the European Authority system 95, and therefore approaching it in its entirety, in the terms in which it was presented by the Commission.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, I allow myself to say first of all that my group appears to this proposal, as it makes it more uniform, immediately comparable and specifies the statistical basis for an economic and monetary union oriented towards stability and real growth.There has already been talk of the different sectors.For me it is decisive that the statistical data are now more reliable and comparable.This is necessary because we must be able to trust each other, and applies to the various institutions of the European Union and for all Member States within the monetary union.An adjustment of the procedure is important for two reasons: firstly, for the single market.Reliable and immediately comparable data and statistics are generally of great importance for an exact representation of the situation and developments in the single market.Secondly, for the economic and monetary union.The 1993 regulation on the application of the protocol must be harmonized, at national and regional level, with the methodology of the European system of integrated economic accounts.This is indispensable for a correct and reliable detection of the deficits.This adjustment will allow a more precise evaluation of the deficits and the debt situation in the Member States.On a technical level it will have very concrete repercussions on the effective position of the States, as the data are automatically modified according to the public deficit.I also find positive that the estimate of the deficits for the 1999 exercise, which should be published in March 2000, is already carried out according to the new century, which is based on analysis on consolidated and relevant aggregates from an economic point of view.I briefly take advantage of this debate also to launch an appeal to all governments and political parties so that they do everything possible to never have to start the procedure relating to excessive deficits."	it
"I tell you as an entrepreneur who is quite interested in it.But a system cannot work like that!It only works in the coupling.I give you an example: The European Union rightly promoted the Grönitz steel mill in Brandenburg, although only 700 of 5,000 jobs are left.However, these are competitive jobs, because this steel mill is now number 2 of the tool steel manufacturers in the Federal Republic of Germany.Anyone who now endangers the production of this steel mill by receiving the granted aid at the time not only endangers the steelworks itself, they endanger an employer in this region, which of course also depends on small and medium -sized companies.Of course, this cannot be a competitive policy of the European Union!If we want to have competition, we have to get this coupling between the economic necessities and the business requirements.This is also the only opportunity to build regional economic cycles in the underdeveloped regions via this path that leads to people being socially secured that purchasing power is strengthened.This means that we also have to take a decisive account of a demand -oriented economic policy than just the offer -oriented!Mr President, never before I was elected Parliament in 1994, I have met a report with such anti-Irish undertones as the report by Mr. Jonckheer, which we debate about today.I would like to quote from the report literally: ""The state aid per employee ... are in Italy, Germany ... and Ireland at the highest, but Ireland clearly comes first when the state and joint aid from the regional and social funds are viewed together."" I believe that the rapporteur simply juggles with the numbers here.I can hardly understand how he can include regional and social funds in this mathematical equation.I would like to remind my colleagues that the European Union has approved the new guidelines for regional aid for the period until after 2000.This was just an expansion of the political goals of completing the internal market in Europe.Regional differences must be overcome so that the internal market can develop successfully and thrive.I welcome it that after 2000 grants of 40 % and in the case of SMEs and their investment of investments, 15 % are also intended for companies that are located in target 1 regions.I remember Mr. Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland are at least separated from the continental European market by two larger seas.No other Member State is so disadvantaged.Mr President, my very worshiped ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues!The cartel ban is the core of a functioning competition order in Europe.The commission perceived the practical handling of monitoring the antitrust ban;This must also be agreed at first.But with regard to the solution, opinions differ.The commission's proposal does not differ formally from the cartel ban, but as a result, this proposal is a transition from a ban with a reservation of permission to permission with a ban on prohibition.This is the transition from the prohibition principle to abuse principle.Such a serious system change is decidedly rejected by me and other colleagues.I do not accept that an implementation problem in practice should be the reason for changing the legal system."	de
It is therefore also extremely important that this cumulative condition can be accepted.To finish, I will repeat that, in my opinion, our colleague Di Pietro has accomplished an excellent work by presenting a report which offers, within the limited framework of existing possibilities, all the guarantees of preserving individual rights and fundamental freedoms.However, if we want to provide a greater feeling of security to the European citizen, we must work even more on judicial cooperation.Mr. President, my group is delighted that one succeeds in an agreement aimed at regulating the daily practice of mutual aid in criminal matters.The aim of this regulation is to define mutual rights and duties between states or citizens or in the relationship between citizens and authorities.The proposal that is submitted to us is complex because, if it deals with agreements between the Member States, it nevertheless has deep consequences on the relationship between the citizen and the authorities.However, the council proposal is terribly insufficient in the field of legal protection.To use the terms of the rapporteur Di Pietro, the proposal even testifies to colossal deficiencies.The agreement allows requests for chain legal assistance which combine the procedures the authorities and the penal systems of other Member States.The way in which this is regulated leads to that no judge can control this entire chain.Additional measures are therefore necessary, such as the obligation made to judicial police officers to meet any request for testimony in a criminal case involving documents of their provenance.Another point that poses a problem for my group is that the proposal of the council crowds the principle of proportionality to the feet.In any case, no limitation of the scope is advanced.The agreement is therefore not only applicable to the fight against serious crimes and organized crime.Nowhere is it mentioned that it is limited to criminal law.It is therefore not unthinkable that the Union is soon fighting mosquitoes with cannons and that the rights of citizens go up in smoke.Mr. President, the Convention on Mut on Division in Criminal matters, which we examine today, contains the essential minimum for effective and rapid collaboration between the various judicial or investigation bodies.It concerns notifications, the exchange of information, the temporary transfer of prisoners, the restitution of goods, testimonies by videoconference, survey activities and those called Undercover, telephone interceptions, etc.This is the minimum on which we can grant ourselves and I hasten to add that if certain amendments had to pass like, for example, amendments 32 and 81 or 70 or 71 reviewed, the whole agreement would be reduced to a simple exchange of notifications or information.Consequently, she should be thrown in the basket and we would vote against.I hope that the common sense of deputies from various groups will encourage them to reject these amendments.The fact that this question has not been the subject of a framework agreement and has remained at the level of conventions is a defeat for Parliament.	fr
"It is correct to focus attention on the access of education systems and public administrations to the Internet and on the use of the network by their part and create the so -called ""knowledge company"", as it is right to attract attention to the access to the risk capital as well as to promote small and medium -sized enterprises with other tools.In the proposal for the summit, the Commission has set quantitative objectives regarding the evolution on the side of employment, unemployment and female employment.In addition, the commission in its proposal also established the objective of reducing the problems of poverty in Europe in the next ten years.I believe it is important to put the emphasis on common objectives, so that the policy of the different countries in these subjects will be different and will have to be.Some Member States of the Union - without citing anyone and without forgetting anyone - have to face high youth unemployment, while in others, for example Denmark, youth unemployment is very low, indeed a real war between employers and training institutes is underway to grab young people.Among the countries there are differences in problems, systems, cultures and traditions and therefore the choices of the tools to achieve the common objective of employment growth and the reduction of social exclusion must also be different.The formulation of employment policy guarantees it through the process of exchange of ideas and experiences decided in Luxembourg and despite the numerous common traits of the problems that we will have to face in the coming years on the front of social policy and employment, there are also common challenges, and some of them will have to solve them on their own, but it is equally fundamental that in the search for a solution to social problems, the countries do not hinder each other,mutually.I believe that it is important to pursue a common objective, but it is equally fundamental that each country retains its sovereignty and responsibility for the elaboration of social policy and employment and that there is a certain competition between the systems, which can act as a catalyst for dynamics and development in the elaboration of social policy and employment.Mr. President, as representative of Flanders and on behalf of what I would call the regions-nation represented within the European free alliance, I was impressed by his harangue in favor of a decisive European approach not so much to strengthen the power of the fifteen Member States, but rather to enhance their collaboration.He spoke of the existence of fifteen distinct public opinions, but in reality there are many more, given that there are enormous differences within the Member States.As a Belgian town, do I have to remember the differences in opinion between Flanders and Vallonia?Or between the former Eastern Germany and western Germany?There is also the danger of a division of public opinion following globalization.As in the past we had the gap between rich and poor, now we see the gap emerge between those who manage to keep up with the developments of our society and those who do not succeed and remain on the margins."	it
We expect the Commission to take this into account in its proposal as a social action program.Social convergence is also a necessity in view of the expansion, in part to strengthen the social model, in part to counter the risks of social dumping.The Commission should take into consideration the hypothesis of elaborating a special action program on social policy in the context of expansion.The discussion that took place in the parliamentary commission was constructive.Many amendments were presented, but it was equally possible to reach a consensus around the report.The amendments now presented to the vote in the classroom have been reduced to 15 and this shows a considerable convergence of views.A part of the amendments come back now after the discussion in the parliamentary commission.I intend to reject them.I am also contrary to the amendments presented by the TDI group, as I do not believe that they add anything to the report.My group instead intends to support amendment no.14 presented by the liberal group.I consider it a good proposal.Of course, it is similar to amendment no.1, but amendment n.14 is better.In conclusion, I want to say that the European Union is not only made of commercial cooperation.The European Union is also made of employment and social justice.For the purpose of creating a Europe of citizens, social policy plays a very important role.With this report, Parliament intends to make its contribution to the strengthening of the social dimension in the European reality.We hope that the Council and the Commission take our contribution seriously and that they take this into account for the purposes of future social policy.The Lisbon summit will offer an excellent opportunity to present such a strategy.Mr. President, I strongly congratulate Mr Andersson for the relationship on the modernization of social protection that we are called to discuss today.As coordinator of the group of the European People's Party to the Commission for employment and social affairs, I am pleased with the compromise that we managed to reach thanks to the strong commitment of the honorable Andersson.I am also happy because he resumed a relationship that in the previous legislature he brought my signature and because the general guidelines of his text partially reflect those of mine.The Andersson report refers to a communication published by the Commission in June 1999, whose final objective is the deepening of the collaboration between the Member States and the European Union in the field of social protection.In this perspective, important partial objectives are defined: first of all, the promotion of employment and the concern that work guarantees a fixed income;Secondly, the rehabilitation and economic sustainability of pension regimes;Thirdly, the promotion of social integration and, fourth, the guarantee of high -level health services and at not excessive costs.In view of the achievement of these objectives, it is essential to pay great attention to the aspects relating to equality between the two sexes.It seems to me to be congratulated for the communication of the Commission, also because these four factors, if they do not even constitute the main terms of the public debate, are particularly felt by many citizens of the European Union.	it
Diplomatic pressures are only effective when they rely on credible economic and military threats.The rest is only vux piles.Member States must therefore either allocate more money or get more involved in favor of modern mobile units so that our soldiers have to protect themselves from the best possible material;We will then rejoice decisions made last Monday in Sintra.The third heavy load that weighs on your shoulders is the guarantee of parliamentary control.Above all, it must be exercised at the level of the Member States.No soldier can be sent on a mission without the agreement of the national parliament.It is therefore wrong to speak of a European army.It is a force made up of national units.What is new is that it is fast, well prepared and that it has an effective common command and modern equipment.There is also naturally room for a certain right of gaze and control on the part of our parliament.You are often our guest, whether in plenary or foreign affairs committee, human rights, common security and defense policy, and we consider you someone capable of speaking and listening.I wish to finish rejoice with you the incredible unit of thought and the speed at which this new cooperation is set up.Some of us met the Portuguese Minister of Defense yesterday.He was as delighted and positively surprised as you are to note that we could agree on so many things.Remember that there are also non-aligned countries around the table.We share your joy as soon as we do not go too fast to the point of creating a breach in transatlantic cooperation.This is something that I would like to emphasize again, and I will finally insist on the fact that the objective of all this is to become so credible that, when we exert economic and military pressures, military intervention never takes place.This is the aim of all this, and it is therefore also important that you worked in collaboration with Mr. Patten, because it is the military, economic and diplomatic pressures which, in the community, will put a barrier for the encroachments in the surrounding territories.Mr. President, Mr. Solana, we are all big children.You make plans on the comet and in your road plan until 2003 there are 60,000 soldiers.It's extraordinary what in Sintra we decided to do in 2004, 2005, 2006. But in the year 2000 for Kosovo?You spoke with Mr. Gil-Robles, I received an email from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pretina at the moment.He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina.He treated Roma, Albanians, Serbs, and that is an unfounded thing in Kosovo.He was murdered, he has three children.We need police officers today in Kosovo!We need soldiers who do not apply a doctrine.	fr
What we need is better internal control and more termination options.We have to change the staff statute and the disciplinary procedures and, last but not least, practice.Article 52 of the HR statute on dismissal due to serious omissions is currently hardly used.We should rather tidy up and sweep in front of our own door than to ask for the establishment of new great institutions.President, we all want to contribute to fighting fraud in Europe.However, the question arises as to what contribution the European Union makes?The answer is that we know terrifyingly little.The summit of Tampere was about fighting crime.Allegedly everyone was satisfied with it, but there were hardly any progress in the substance.European legal provisions for fighting fraud are not in force, because the Member States, which has already been pointed out, has already been pointed out, and the contract texts submitted do not ratify.So a lot has to happen there.But what has to be done?Two things, and Ms. Theato's report clearly and clearly shows this.First, the same sanctions must apply in all Member States of the European Union for European frauds.Standardization in this special area.Second, a European public prosecutor's office that has two tasks must be created: firstly, to help the national prosecutors to support European fraud, and secondly, the judicial surveillance of Europol and Olaf, because these two investigative offices can currently act without legal control.In front of the European public prosecutor we do not need to be frightened, everyone around me only see ghosts.She is really something positive.Just like Europol.Europol, the police cooperation, is not above the national police services, but serves the exchange of information between the police departments.This is exactly what a small restricted European public prosecutor has to do, only not at the stage of the investigation, but of law enforcement.The parliament is for that.The committee of independent experts as well.I appeal to the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to also commit to this measure.President, I want to concentrate on the problem of Corpus juris.I strongly support the findings made by Ms. Morgan.The Corpus juris was set up without any public debate or participation.A European public prosecutor's office committed to the continental European investigation principle with national law overarching Europe -wide decision -making powers would have a lasting impact on the traditional system in Ireland as well as in the United Kingdom.Member States have the right to information about the possibility of a uniform criminal code and a European public prosecutor.When such a plan was presented for the first time, it was said that the EU budget would be limited to cases of fraud.But when the Corpus juris was actually launched in San Sebastian in 1977 - by the way, in front of a selected audience of 140 lawyers and excluding the media - said the then president of the European Parliament, Gil -Robles Gil -Delgado, that this was only a preliminary stage and that it was intended to extend the EU's responsibility to all areas of crime.We need a public debate on this topic.Member States and the citizens in the Member States must be extensively informed.The question of a potential danger for the traditional legal system in Ireland and the United Kingdom must also be discussed.	de
Dear colleague, I take your explanation and the existence of this joint resolution.If the Presidium's departments confirm that it was submitted properly, it goes without saying that it is taken into account.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 p.m.(The session is closed at 8:14 p.m.) Approval of the protocol of the previous meeting Mr. President, I just want to say that there was a terrorist attack in Madrid this morning.The explosion of a car bomb has died.It is simply about judging such terrorist actions on behalf of my parliamentary group.Thank you very much, Ms. Fraga.We have already heard of this unfortunate incident.Unfortunately, the Spanish society is once again haunted by murderous terrorism and find its words as they will understand, the President of the president, since this session takes place under Spanish chair.(The parliament approves the protocol.) Resumption of the session period I declare the session period of the European parliament to resume on Friday, January 21, 2000.Ms. President, allow me to remember that tomorrow the catastrophe of Monte Cermis will be for the second time.Two years ago, in Italy, in Cavalese, an American aircraft coming from the NATO base Aviano died during a low -flying flight - in which the flight height permitted for safety reasons - the cables of a cable car and tore over 20 European citizens to their death.Since then, the relatives of the victims, who have failed to consume the consolation of justice, have been at least an immediate financial compensation by the United States because the guilty pilot was not held responsible under criminal law.I therefore appeal to the Parliament President and the President of the Commission to work for immediate compensation from the US Authorities and thus help the victims' family members.Thank you very much, Ms. Angelilli, I take note of this.The agenda according to the agenda follows the work plan.At the request of various factions and, as a result of the President's conference just ended, I suggest that in accordance with Article 50 of our rules of procedure, I propose a one -half -hour debate about current, urgent and important questions about the reaction of the Union to the government negotiations in Austria.If you agree to the proposal, the incumbent council president, Mr. Seixas da Costa, and the President of the Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi, will open the pronunciation.Who would like to speak for this proposal?Mrs. President!I take the floor to support the decision of the President's decision, and take the opportunity to say in my own name and in the name of the Social Democratic Group in the way I publicly criticized the presidency in January that we consider the explanations submitted by the presidency to be appropriate;We share them in terms of content, time and form.Now, Ms. President, it is really difficult to find a pronunciation that better suits Article 50 of our rules of rules.This is an current, extraordinarily important and urgent debate.That is why we think that we have to change the agenda to accept that.(Applause) does someone want to speak against this proposal?	de
"That requirement is clearly the single market.To what extent has the single market been consolidated?I want to remember Mr. Prodi and his colleagues who still remain here the results of the study carried out by the commission itself among 3,000 European companies.About 40% of the companies in this study continue to support additional costs to standardize their products or services according to national specifications.It is a study of the commission itself.They are the classic symptoms of the continuous obstruction exerted by national governments;Bureaucratic procedures block the entrance to the market.The commission's program reflects a worrying self -complacency in regard to the realization of the internal market.We must keep pressure high in all areas, eliminating additional barriers, intensifying pressure on member states that fail to comply with the rules of the single market and, naturally, extend it to new areas of fundamental importance, such as financial services.Only on a solid basis such as the single market, the extension agenda can be carried out successfully.An enlarged Europe must enhance the current virtues of the Union.A single market that extends throughout the enlarged union will be a colossal achievement.I finish saying, in the name of my conservative colleagues - and we constitute the second largest national delegation of this Parliament - that we commit to fully support the commission and Mr. Prodi in the realization of this historical task.Mrs. President, Mr. President, Lords, at the time of our investiture vote we gave him an appointment for today.Today serious issues begin since we are precisely going to pronounce on your program.Allow me, in the words you have pronounced before this assembly, to concentrate my intervention in what you have called a new governorate.It makes it an instrument of reconciliation with our fellow citizens.But after this term of ""new governorate"" I believe that the question of the functioning of the institutions is simply found, the question of the functioning of our public authorities, if we agree to consider that the European Union must be a public power.The articulation between the institutions of the Union, the powers of the Member States and the local and regional authorities, very good.But, is we thus reconcile citizens and European construction?Is it really like that we will answer the fundamental issues, which are not so much ""who does what"", but rather ""what we do together"", since this is what sows the bewilderment in our fellow citizens?In his speech, he mentions the challenges that await us, those of globalization, those of extension and, I will add, the future of our social model.Therefore, with my group we insist both this letter project, since it seems to us that yes, in our calendar, we have included the writing of this letter of fundamental rights is because we are in a moment of appointment with the history, that our union needs to redefine the values ​​around which it has been built inside its current borders, but also in the perspective of the next extensions we want, although not at any price.Our fellow citizens wait for us more Europe, but not any Europe."	es
They are justified concerns.It has been said several times: Justice Delayed is Justice Denied.The Commission has the maximum understanding for the observations raised.Precisely for this reason I would like to articulate my answer as follows.As Parliament knows well, the Commission is convinced that, without a radical reform, in the short term the community jurisdictional instances run the risk of no longer being able to fulfill their task within a reasonable period of time.The Commission therefore turned to a group of experts for a consultancy on the reforms that could be implemented in order to allow the Court and the Court to maintain the quality and coherence of their jurisprudence unchanged in the decades to come.The Commission takes note of the request of the Court which hopes for a strengthening of its staff, but believes that for the moment the transfer of skills proposed must be considered in light of the study just mentioned.In other words, when the study is completed, the commission will formulate an opinion as soon as possible.Thanks, Mr. Commissioner.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, at 11.00 am .. Extraordinary financial aid to Kosovo the agenda bears the discussion on the report (A5-0022/2000), presented by Honorable Brok on behalf of the Commission for Foreign Affairs, the rights of man, common security and the defense policy, on the proposal of decision of the Council relating to the granting of an exceptional financial assistance to Kosovo (com (1999) 0598 -C5-0045/2000 - 1999/0240 (CNS)).I am reported that the speaker will arrive with a delay of a few minutes.I propose to start the discussion immediately, remembering that the speaker will intervene as soon as he has come to the courtroom. Mr Bourlanges has now faculty of speech, as a speaker for the opinion of the Commission for Budgets.Mr President, the question in question is important and urgent.The Parliament, at the request of the Commission, is pronounced quickly because it is necessary to spread the news that men and women die today in Kosovo simply because the temperature has dropped to 25 degrees below zero and that some people, who lend their work for free, perform a huge job in order to ensure minimal support.Therefore, an emergency request was made, which we respond favorably.35 million euros were requested.We agree to grant them and turn to the Commission to ensure that, once the decision is made, the sums are allocated and pour as quickly as possible.It is a macro -financial help, which arouses reactions everywhere because it does not respect the canons of the liberal doctrine which consist in not financially intervening in support of an administration.We are not of this notice, but rather we believe that it is essential to contribute to the establishment of an administration in Kosovo and that it is not at all absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public agents in the region.It would have been very useful if we had been able to do it in Russia in the nineties to avoid the dissolution of that state.The second important problem is that we are called to give assistance, as promised by the donors, but that then the only ones are paid since the others do not contribute.	it
On the contrary: his draft must meet the legislation of the individual Member States in the field of criminal law.The intention of making a unanimous decision can lead to compromises that do not withstand this exam.A conscientious parliamentary control by the European Parliament, but above all through the national parliaments, is of great importance.Di Pietro's proposal to delete the current article 18, which includes listening to telephone calls, among other things, is understandable, but very rigorously.The wording of Article 18 is unclear: it limits the activities of the intelligence services, but obviously allows the monitoring of telecommunications traffic by a Member State on the territory of another Member State without its prior approval.In this way, the Member States would make themselves largely vulnerable, and it is doubtful whether there are sufficient guarantees that both the state in which surveillance is carried out and its citizens are protected.Additional proposals, such as repeated references to the European Convention on Human Rights, the rights of defense and the suspect as well as the failure of the Member States in the implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights, excessively inflate the text of the Convention.I see the problem, but I think that this could have been clarified with a single text change.Despite certain concerns, the Dutch members of the EDD parliamentary group will not deny the Di Pietro report in the vote.President, Lord, ladies and gentlemen!We have a report here, which is of the greatest importance not only because of its content, but also because it is a first step towards creating more smooth relationships in the field of judicial cooperation.It took place exclusively at the level of intergovernmental relationships, and the European citizen was unable to perceive any concrete signs of the Union Citizenship, which was repeatedly conjured up.On the one hand, judicial measures have nothing to do with the community dimension, on the other hand, we are already experiencing a level of freedom of movement for passenger transport, from which the criminals also benefit.According to Article 29 of the contract, it is now the aim of the Union to offer the citizens a high level of security in a space of freedom, security and right by developing a common procedure for the Member States in the field of police and justitial cooperation in criminal matters and fighting and fighting racism and xenophobia.It must be emphasized that the creation of Europol is already one step forward, but now the next step has to follow, namely the reinforcement of the judicial cooperation in criminal matters, so to gradually erect a real European legal area in accordance with the goal of creating a space of freedom, security and right.This draft is therefore the concern to complete the conventional instruments already available in other legal areas and to facilitate their application in the Member States in order to improve the judicial cooperation in criminal matters through an equally rapid and effective legal assistance, but to respect the essential guarantees of the rights of defense and the general principles in the field of human rights, which in the right of the Member States and in the rightEuropean Convention on Human Rights.This reservation in the essential rights, freedoms and guarantees has caused us to support the withdrawal of the proposed text in relation to telephone monitoring, whereby the Council recommends that the Council provide an independent legal instrument that can remedy this.	de
Herring Council President, I completely agree with them.The problem is not Mr. Kouchner, but the legal basis for his work, i.e. the resolution 1244. Apart from that, I mean that the responsibility of the Union and thus, but also our responsibility, is to overcome the provisional character of Resolution 1244 and to develop a future perspective for the entire region.In my opinion, the lack of a fixed perspective provokes or favors the riots, accidents and murders, of which Mr. Alavanos spoke.Does the Council intend to ask the question of the final status of Kosovo?And if so, does he intend to do this in connection with a general reorganization of the region by preventing the creation of numerous small -scale states as possible as possible, as is the aim of some, and by bringing together the individual parts, in this case Kosovo and Albania?Since the questioner is not present, request No. 7 is obsolete.Inquiry No. 8 of (H-0796/99): Concerns: New Interreg initiative in point 1 of Appendix 2 of your design of an interreg Interreg entitled 'Promotion of the urban, rural and coastal rooms' allows the Commission to renovate and further develop historical city nuclei by way of cross-border strategy.However, residential buildings are excluded.In view of the fact that there are numerous houses in rural areas that are of historical interest, including very small buildings, as well as the need to do something against the rural exodus for various reasons and to make rural areas more attractive, the advice is not of the opinion that these goals could also be supported by also supporting projects of housing construction in the areas recorded by Interreg?President!The council, and I would even say the Portuguese presidency, are extremely aware of the importance of the problems you, Mr. MP, pointed out in your question, and I would like to explain that we have always paid great attention to the community policies for the development of rural areas.I would like to refer to the new aid regulation accepted in May 1999 for rural development, which forms the community framework for the promotion of the sustainable development of rural areas, and this was known to be the developments that took place in the course of the negotiations on Agenda 2000 and the treatment of agricultural issues at community level.Through the European orientation and guarantee fund for agriculture, the EAGFL, the concern is behind this community funding concept to reverse the tendency of the desolation of rural areas, to which they, Mr., rightly refer to your question.On the other hand, the European Fund for Regional Development, the ERDR, also contributes to the promotion of economic and social cohesion in its area of ​​responsibility by corrected the main regional imbalances and participates in the development and restructuring of rural areas.In this regard, it should be remembered that the ERRE also contributes to the promotion of sustainable development and also to create sustainable creation of jobs in rural areas.The entirety of this instrument of the community enables us to implement a development policy for rural areas, which today, in the rest, represents a development and funding line of common agricultural policy in one of its fields of action and regional policy.	de
"Let's say it once again: the cooperation and development policy of the European Union is not consistent.Therefore, in the name of the Green Group/European Free Alliance, I ask the Parliament, the institutions, to the commission to try, finally, coherence to our policy.Mr. President, I consider this debate particularly opportune not only for the importance of the issue of development in general, but also for its actuality.The Seattle meeting failed and the North-South relations were there evidence for more reasons.The meeting held in that American city highlighted that globalization involves deeply unequal and unfavorable results for the poorest countries.At this precise moment - and with an obvious influence of that failure - the United Nations Conference on Commerce and Development is still being held in Bangkok.Meanwhile, the negotiations that have determined the future of the Lomé Convention have been said.With that, it is enough to highlight the importance of the actuality of this matter.And we can also add the next European Union Summit - OUA, finally agreed for next April in Cairo.But, in addition, any analysis, however light, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something, or even much, goes wrong in the level of North-South relations, even between the European Union and the less advanced countries.It is enough to consider that the category of the so -called less advanced countries has passed, in the last thirty years, from 25 to 48 countries, which now represent 13% of humanity, but to which only 0.4% of exports and 0.6% of world imports correspond.Or also the unfortunate circumstance that public aid for development, promoted by rich countries, has been reduced since 1990 by almost 23%.For the rest, the recent cuts related to that sphere in the community budget for this exercise are inserted in that trend, in addition to constituting a bad and wrong political signal.The little suspicious Mr. Michel Camdessus, still director of the International Monetary Fund, said in the speech he delivered last Sunday at the beginning of the work of the Cnuced - and I pass to cite - that ""the international community gives with one hand and pulls with the other.""Naturally, the support granted by the countries developed to those of lower development.Such a statement, that it seems an irony, coming from who's coming, but the truth is that he gave it, I myself had the opportunity to hear it, I do not seem to me that I disagree with anything of the current reality and moves me to affirm that it is essential to think again and launch in new molds the north-south relations, in particular the need to think about the role of the European Union in this frameIt cannot - or should not - cease to constitute a strategic objective of the Union, so it is essential to reflect on globalization in progress taking into account the essential orientations and the dominant underlying interests and, in that context and in particular, the enormous consequences and the pernicious effects it has for less developed countries."	es
Finally, his proposal would deny a passport to those companies that do not want to carry out the activities contemplated in the investment services directive.As for the question posed by the honorable Huhne, this morning he mentioned the deadly coverage operations;But these operations are already allowed by the current article 21, paragraph 1, of Directive 611/85 on the OICVMs.So what Mr Huhne asks is already possible.Mr Villiers referred to the possibility of improving the management of the wallet.This too is already possible with current legislation.I refer to the same article 21, paragraph 1, mentioned in relation to the question of the honorable Huhne.Mr Kauppi asks why the Commission prepared a package of measures divided into two separate proposals.The fact is that the first proposal essentially concerns the product, while the second concerns above all the service provider and prospects for the OICVMs.The separation of these two proposals that deal with two different groups of problems should facilitate the negotiating process within the Council.The Commission must not only listen to the Parliament and take into consideration the proposals but, as well as well, it must also deal with the Council.It is for this reason that the Commission has presented these two proposals separately.Finally, Mr Balfe complained of the limits, in his opinion excessive, which characterize the entire proposal presented by the Commission.Instead, it seems to us that these limits are justified, first of all, by the need to diversify the investments, secondly, by the vulnerability caused by the need to repay investments at any time, and thirdly by the purpose of avoiding excessive interference in investment funds.For all these reasons, the Commission considers, also considering the prudence that must always be used in this sector, that these limitations are necessary.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place at 12.00.Judicial assistance in criminal matters between EU Member States, the agenda bears the report (A5-0019/2000), presented by the honorable of Pietro on behalf of the Commission for the freedoms and rights of citizens, justice and internal affairs, on the project of act of the Council that establishes the convention relating to judicial assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, with letters of 3 August 1999 and 3 December 1999, the Council requested the European Parliament, pursuant to article 39 of the Treaty, to express its opinion on a convention project between Member States aimed at ensuring better judicial assistance in criminal matters.As you can see, therefore, it is a very important project that actually serves the States of the Union to be able to equip itself with a more complete and more homogeneous judicial assistance tool.In truth, there are still, within the Council, some divergences regarding the type of convention, regarding some clauses provided.Some of these divergences have already been demanded, others remain.The spirit of the proposal, however, is to equip the operators of the law - the magistrates primarily, but also the citizens concerned - with an operational tool valid for the fight against crime, in respect of the fundamental guarantees of defense and the general principles of human rights.	it
This infectious anemia of the salmon is caused by an Orthomixomicrovirus that decomposes the blood of the salmon and thus causes his death.The disease spreads slightly through mucilage in salt water, etc.The 1993 guideline allows not only to remove the diseased fish, but but also all fish of an affected farm, as in the case of a cow in a herd you slaughter the entire herd for precautionary reasons.Now we are proposed a loosening of this guideline in such a way that not the entire inventory is eliminated, but only the fish reported as sick.As for the other fish, you would have time to wait for what is happening depending on the local circumstances.I think that is an extremely dangerous approach.I would like to draw your attention to this, because you cannot be satisfied with the statement that the temperature limit of 27 ºC is sufficiently protected and consequently there is no danger.But does that also apply to women?There are still no studies in this regard in the human tissue.In addition, there is also a risk to the environment, because as is well known, there is an incubation period in salmon, and consequently, if they are consumed, they can transmit this virus without being ill and therefore a danger.Another danger to the environment is that this disease is transferred to wild fish as we have seen.For this reason, together with my colleague Patricia McKenna, we brought amendments to the proposals submitted by the Commission.Mr. Piétrasanta has explained why we support some aspects of the Commission's proposal, especially in terms of the development of a vaccine and the compensation of fish breeders that are forced to remove their fish.The idea of ​​changing the emission policy does not make us very happy.Now it has been found that Norway has done better work in combating ISA epidemic and that we will achieve a standard as high as Norway with the proposed changes, but it must be said that there is more than just a difference between the Norwegian politics and the politics of the community.This is a measure of the community, which also applies to Ireland, where I come from, should occur similarly unfortunate circumstances.There are further differences, and this affects the procedure in relation to inspections of affected companies, the dismissal periods, restrictions for the transfer of contaminated fish and contaminated material, etc.Before we pre -copy the Norwegians, we should try whether we cannot contain the catastrophe with these other means.A lot has been talked about the BSE in the past.For years, the Greens have pushed to deal with the problem with the problem.If you had done this at the time, many farmers and the EU could have saved a lot of money.This also has to do with environmental protection, with the protection of farmers themselves and with the protection of public health.I would like to thank Mr. Hudghton for his excellent report on the infectious anemia of salmon and his general support for the measures proposed by the Commission.I also thank all of my previous speakers for your contribution this evening.	de
The first is that of the harmonization of national regional planning policies and regional development policies.Subsidies are not enough to make development, when infrastructure or public services are lacking.It is therefore a substantive question that we must ask ourselves: how can we make sure that the Union policy is articulated with the national subsidiary policies of regional planning.The second challenge is that of enlargement, which will naturally have considerable consequences both in budgetary terms and geographic terms.These are two sites that I invite the commissioner to work and which I ask him to associate us.Finally, during this period of natural disasters, I would still like to mention the question of the employment of structural funds.We know that it is up to each of the states to redistribute part of the envelopes.It should not be, as states want to want, that Europe disappears completely.Today, public opinion, the press, accuse us of being absent subscribers while we are going to finance a large part of national efforts.I think we have to be able to say it loud and clear.I think that we would also have to establish or ask the Member States that they provide information on European aid, whenever they are mobilized to repair the damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.Mr. President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria strengthens the rise in inequalities in all forms.For experts in the French plan, for example, the most likely scenario is today a digging of regional differentiations within each country.However, the structural funds have helped brake this process.Our project of a Europe turned towards the satisfaction of social needs aims for convergence by the top of the conditions of existence.Its implementation would certainly imply an extension of redistribution instruments such as structural funds.We offer in particular a unified capital tax, which would supply funds used to support the harmonization of social protection systems and the reduction of working time at European level.However, the commission, required to present orientations, does it only with regret and vaguely.The report proposed today restores its place to politics.It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.This is what will lead us to vote it.Mr. President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work.I think that in the coming years, in front of the challenge of globalization and enlargement in the East, Europe will be more than ever the need for adequate and precise orientations as to the programming and the revival of its economy.Consequently, Europe as a whole, and each of the Member States in particular, will have to make the most of all its resources and its capacities, and therefore also the structural funds available.To do this, a European Commission is needed which, beyond its good intentions, clarifies its guidelines and engages maximum in control of the use of these resources by the Member States.	fr
"For the rest, the way this advice is being prepared is very illustrative of it.First, the degree of seriousness and depth of the document presented in January.Then, the different preparatory conferences, the contribution that both entrepreneurs and trade unionists are doing to that summit.And above all the last contribution that was made at the recently held meeting and to which Nobel Prizes and Ministers of Science and Technology attended.It is a sample of seriousness, of attention to the content in the preparation of the summit.But we also support the initiative as regards the central objective that has already been stated here, because for the first time the issue of employment and social issues, but it is considered possible to ""achieve the objective of full employment"" is not only put in the center of the European debate.For many years, many people said that it was impossible, that in new societies it would not be possible.I congratulate him, Mr. President, because that issue returns to the agenda without denying social cohesion and values ​​that, for us, are fundamental, because they are not only the matrix of the founding project of the European Union, but they are also the matrix of our civilization and, above all, of our way of understanding the degree of demand for solidarity among all Europeans.We already said it in January and I would like to repeat it: we do not content ourselves with that this strategic objective is the priority of an presidency, only a priority for six months.And we challenge the Council again and the Commission to register it: not as a priority of six months, but as a goal of the European Union, as important as that of extension or as the deepening of the European Union.Only in this way can it meet the objective of seriousness that the presidency is preparing this extraordinary council.Congratulations, Mr. President.Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council and Mr. President of the Commission, I would like to express my joy before the fact that such an active day has been raised in favor of employment and economic development for the Lisbon summit.It is an order of the day that insists on the need to be a strong and dynamic economy and an improvement in competitiveness that guarantee the objective of greater employment in the EU.It induces the reflection the fact that the EU is so late both concerning the research and development of new technologies and in the creation of jobs with respect to the US, it is necessary to join efforts to promote research and development, including research related to information technologies and it is necessary to reinforce the internal market and create the necessary conditions to make the maximum performance of new technologies and develop trade through the Internet.It is successful to call attention to the issue of access and the use of the Internet by educational systems and public administration and create what has been called ""the Knowledge Society"" and it is also successful to focus on risk capital access and differently strengthen the situation of small and medium enterprises."	es
We ask that this possibility makes significant changes to our life in society, that democracy is also synonymous with equality between men and women, that the latter are not excluded economically or socially, as is the case today.That values ​​dear to women, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security, environmental protection predominantly guide life in the European Union and, if possible, in the world.To do this, women must be given the opportunity to intervene against the inertia of a society essentially imbued so far with male values.Our experience teaches us that freedom and decision -making capacity do not go, they conquer.Let us continue this conquest and that this new century brings us victory, not on men, nor on anyone: the victory of equality between men and women.We can no longer afford to lose a single opportunity.The great challenge now posed to all Europeans in general, and women in particular, concerns the new economy and new technologies in the information sector.The Lisbon summit, which will be held at the end of the month, particularly concerns women.The employment rate in Europe must be increased, significantly lower than that of the United States and Japan.To do this, you have to put many more women at work and work in new jobs, for which the European Union is in deficit.I therefore ask the Council and the Commission What proposals they intend to present at the next Lisbon summit so that the new economy and the new Europe that we want to build definitively integrates equality between men and women?Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, I was delighted with your intervention because you dared to quote the Member States where the political representation of women is a success, namely Finland, France and Sweden, but also because you have not failed to mention the states where things are going less well, which is the case for my own country in particular and of Greece, country that you forgot to appoint.I have also heard that very few women may appear on the lists in the next elections that will take place in Greece.I believe it is very serious.I appreciated your intervention because I find that it is high time that we had in the European institutions of concrete means to improve the place of women in politics.This is why I think it is essential that this Parliament continues to insist on quotas and that it appears openly in resolution.I myself am, Madam Commissioner, a quota product and I do not believe that a single member of this assembly is able to demonstrate that I am less competent.In some of our European countries, it seems that meritocracy remains such a masculine principle that women have no chance.	fr
"Between 1998 and 1999, the loyalists attacked and killed 123 people, against 93 for the Republicans.In 1999, 193 cases of legal proceedings are noted against loyalists and 97 against Republicans in 1999.Since January 1, 2000, there have been six assassinations perpetrated by loyalists, against two by Republicans;The loyalists participated in six serious shootings, one of which left one dead, and the Republicans with five shootings.Mr. President, this situation cannot continue and we must remedy it.Mr. President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has defined an important objective for the Union.A task that all deputies, the Council and the Commission must assume during this legislature: creation, as has already been said, of a space of freedom, security and justice.The Tampere, engine and craftsman's advice of this objective has proposed a few goals, but the five -year period planned for the development of Chapter IV of the Treaty is too long for the urgent solutions that certain problems require.My first reflection is that the Parliament should not remain on the sidelines of the important decisions which will be taken in this area and that it is necessary to guarantee its participation in the decision -making process, especially with regard to a citizens' project, as the Commissioner said.My second reflection is that it is necessary to advance quickly in the adoption of a common asylum system.We must approve common procedural standards and, above all, put an end to the current confusion between immigration for political causes and that motivated by economic reasons.The latest laws on foreigners, adopted in my country, Spain, or in Belgium, are a warning and demonstrate that the communitarization of immigration policy must be adopted as quickly as possible.My third reflection concerns the external action of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum.We must neither give the impression that the union only wants to defend himself against an avalanche of refugees and economic immigrants.We must bet on a development cooperation policy with the neighboring countries of the East and the Mediterranean area, but with rigor, with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions, which cooperate for the protection of citizens who see their most fundamental rights violated or who wish to emigrate in order to deal with their most basic needs.Finally, with regard to the charter of fundamental rights, European citizens need to visualize their citizenship.Euro, employment or even security are not enough for them.They need the ""European soul"" as an illustrious Spanish teacher said.Mr. President, unlike some of the previous speakers, I would like to come back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr. Vitorino.As Mr. Ceyhun said, the words of this trio resounded like music in our ears.As well as of all music, it must offer a pretty melody and be well orchestrated.Many of us here to consider with great optimism the next six months."	fr
This is particularly clear in France: in the Champagne-Aldennes region, which I represent, the BSP sank from 105 to 94 %of the community average, in the Pays-D-Loire region from 95 to 91 %, in Auvergne from 89 to 83 %.The Rhône-Alpes region and Alsace are also not excluded from this general trend.It is also confirmed in Sweden and Finland, where unemployment has increased to a scary in recent years, as well as in several regions of the United Kingdom.In view of this, it may be surprising that the goal 2, which is intended for the industrial and rural regions in economic restructuring, was sacrificed in connection with the structural fund reform in favor of targets 1 and 3: In the period 1999-2006, 22.5 billion ECU is available, i.e. about just as much as in the period 1994-1999.The areas that are eligible according to goal 5b must bring the greatest victims in this regard: in France, 27 % of the population, which is eligible for the structural funds, will lose their eligibility at the end of the transition period, whereby this percentage in some regions such as Pays de la Loire, Alsace or Basse-Normandy, the voters that are disadvantaged by the party-political benefice economy of the left-wing governmentlies.On such a basis, it is extremely doubtful whether regional policy can contribute to a balanced design of the territories of the Member States of the European Union.Vogau report (A5-0069/1999) In view of the employment situation in the community and the ambition to combat unemployment by the European Union, the analysis of corporate concentrations created by the Commission should also take into account other factors than just competition.As an example, I would like to name the restructuring of the company ABB-Alsthom Power, from which a larger delegation of employees from all over Europe is present here in Strasbourg today.The directorate of ABB-Alsthom Power, which emerged from a merger in June 1999, has announced a restructuring that will lead to the cancellation of jobs in some countries.This fateful job situation raises numerous questions, in particular with regard to the information that has been given to the European works council that has existed since 1996.This means that the Community Directive must be updated and strengthened via the European works councils.This also includes control of the company mergers taking into account the workplace situation, the environment and the consumer.The report of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Currency was inadequate in this regard, so I found my voice..(Pt) The Commission wants to apply the principle of subsidiarity in the area of ​​community competition policy, and therefore it decentralizes the decision -making authority regarding the abuse of marketing positions by agreements between companies that lead to market distortions by transferring it to the national authorities and dishes, but questions in connection with company compilations and state subsidies fall under the registration system.The now point of view is based on the creation of forms of competitive policy to be used faster and cheaper, whereby communal law is to be applied at the level of the national courts and not at the European Court of Justice and is even referred to specialized courts.This partial renationalization of competition policy can be associated with higher costs for the Member States.On the other hand, and the rapporteur is reminiscent of this, on behalf of the competition policy, state monopolies were often replaced by private monopolies by privatizing important sectors and companies in the public sector, as has been done in Portugal with negative effects for the country and workers.	de
In order to respond, the Commission has made several commitments and has undoubtedly adopted many reform measures.It should be recognized that the new president, Mr. Prodi, and his team are really engaged in the implementation of the financial control requirements that Parliament has established.Nevertheless, it is now necessary to include the reform of the European Commission within the framework of the debate which will take place during the preparatory period of the intergovernmental conference which will soon be held and the reform of different policies and initiatives of the EU.The current treaties of the European Union will be amended so that, for example, enlargement is a success.I am sure that we will analyze the next reforms of community institutions during this debate.But for small Member States, it is important that the reforms of the European Commission which will take place does not compromise the representation of small Member States within the Commission.Mr. President, the Commission requests the granting of the discharge for 1997, but, in reality, it does not deserve it.The 1997 financial year is a matter of the old commission;This is why the new commission considers that it has no responsibility to assume.It is correct to say that the execution of the budget for 1997 was of the old commission, but the new commission, on the other hand, has committed to putting order after the scandals and I must admit that I am really not impressed by what it has done so far.The old mentality consisting in hiding things and supporting his friends is unfortunately always present.Some people claim that we would make it better to pass the old faults in oblivion and to restart more beautifully, but I do not think that we can restart even more if we have not previously settled things.I am especially thinking here of recent scandals that affected the Echo program.I am absolutely offended to note the difficulty of obtaining documents relating to this case.I am a rapporteur for the Echo program within the budget control commission and I am difficult to do my work from the moment the commission refuses to give me the information I need.Seen from the outside, it feels like the commission has things to hide.My investigations unfortunately also tend to show that this could be the case.The commission does not put everything on the table and it repeats its ancestral practices.These are such practices that have been fatal at the old commission.I therefore approve, in all respects, the request to give the assembly unconditional access to administrative documents, failing which we cannot do our work.Thank you very much, Madam Commissioner Schreyer!The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.Follow-up to be given to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts The agenda calls for the report (A5-0001/2000) of Mr. Van Hulten, on behalf of the Budget Control Commission, on the follow-up to be given to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the Reformation of the Commission.	fr
In individual passages of the commission proposals, perhaps exaggerated caution perhaps have been carried out, for example with the demand to leave the detainees to the detained defendant as to whether he would agree to a temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for investigative purposes.I personally think it is unacceptable that, for example, Mr. Pinochet can decide whether he is transferred to Spain for a comparison or not.Or with the claim to put a defender aside the witness or expert - and not only to the accused, the accused.But these are minor defects that are hopefully removed by the vote of this high house.The rapporteur has shown a commendable commitment what needs to be recognized and for what I thank him for.The result is noteworthy overall and hopefully will be fully taken into account by the Council.As already mentioned, a question that the most delicate is still unresolved is: it affects Article 18 of the Convention, and therefore the direct monitoring of telecommunications traffic by another Member State, without the latter, in which surveillance is carried out, for help, which is possible today thanks to modern technologies.The topic is very controversial because there is a possible source for misuse.One could say that the proposed regulation is better than nothing overall, but it still appeared to the committee inadequate and not safe enough.It is therefore worth further considerations that in times when the contradictory reports about Echelon awake the ghost of the big brother, presumably more detailed about the instruments and methods with which on the one hand protects personal rights and on the other hand an effective but at the same time can be enabled to be meticulously and at the same time.The goal is to establish if possible, albeit sensitive, balance between the effectiveness of the fight against crime and the maintenance of freedom and dignity: a goal that is not only pursued by the individual states, but also with the politics of the Union, the endeavor of which is to become a space of freedom, security and right.This goal is still a long way off, but it can be achieved in individual steps.The most important step will be the harmonization of the right of the Member States, but for today we want to be satisfied with this little step because it goes in the right direction.President!First of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanations.They show some serious mistakes in this suggestion.The lack of linguistic clarity will inevitably lead to legal uncertainty.However, legal certainty is something that is absolutely necessary in such decisive questions.Due to the sloppy drafting, the convention can be interpreted very far, and it ignores the strict conditions that must apply to surveillance according to the European Convention on Human Rights.Article 18 allows surveillance in another Member State without its inclusion.Not only should that be deleted, but throw out the entire surveillance title at all.In an initiative of the FBI, the user requirements are compiled, which form the basis of current legislation.The Council proposal, which contains these requirements, Enfopol 98, was accepted by this parliament in the Schmid report last May.	de
"The fundamental question, in my opinion, that this Parliament, the Commission and the Council must be done is as follows: What is Europe?What does it mean and that gives us Europe beyond and above the parameters of our national borders?Europe is its population, its history and now its community;But the reason why Culture 2000 is so important for us is the following: I bet that when we ask the question ""What is Europe?"", we respond by saying ""it is our art, it is our literature and it is our heritage.""That is what Culture 2000 represents. It represents the possibility of maintaining a European identity in the 21st century, an identity that blamed the echoes of division, war, poverty, opportunity, of poverty Dans I realized it.And besides that, and this is more prosaic, Madam President, means that we have the ability to learn from previous political initiatives and put it into practice in new programs that are broad, that are transverse and that benefit our creative industries as long as necessary.The program encourages mobility and opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.I only regret that we do not have enough funds to encourage this program according to our aspirations and to make everyone reach.Mrs. President, Ladies, we have already reached the end of a long journey.After the conciliation stage, our institutions can already officially approve the new ""Culture 2000"" program.Thus we will have a totally suitable instrument to carry out, during the next five years, a clear, well -structured and -Toy -fruit -fruitful action in favor of the cultural sector.I welcomed this Happy End today and express my thanks to your lordships.I thank all who in this Parliament have worked for a good end for conciliation to be possible.I want to express my particular thanks to the Commission of Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sports, and in particular to its rapporteur, Mr. Graça Moura, to its president, Mr. Gargani, to the Delegation of the European Parliament and the leaders of the political groups, to the Conciliation Committee and its President, Mr. Imbeni.All of them have made a constructive, balanced and decisive contribution.Throughout this whole negotiation, they have represented a great help and it should be said that the difficult, sometimes painful, negotiation has been done, despite everything, in a minimum period.Now we have a-Marco program, the first of this class for the cultural sector, which allows us to consider our action from a new angle and work for culture more globally, but also more complete and deeper.I would like to congratulate myself together with their lordships of these satisfactory results that, despite a budgetary situation that is not up to our ambitions, should allow us to consider the future in a totally positive way and would like to highlight what President Gargani has just said: the commission has made a statement on the evaluation of the middle of the period."	es
It is, in reality, an international agreement and a commercial agreement.Finally, allow me to express the great hopes that I house in the peace process in that area, a part of the world that desperately needs it, to regroup and reform and help its millions of disadvantaged citizens and beaten by poverty.Mr. President, lordships, that the rules must be respected is something obvious.That you have to enforce them for our partners too.Everyone understands that today we worry about it, but I would not want our demand to be considered selective.Nor would I want our oral question to be received as an accusation.Due to the fact that our demand is not selective, the commission must also feel invited to study the use of community funds in the neighboring regions of Israel.And because the interpellation of the commission is not, nor should it be considered as an accusation, I want to remember two essential points for the balance of our action.First, everyone who knows the region knows that the development of the Palestinian economy is closely related to the Economic Cooperation Agreement with Israel.The Oslo protocol foresees a customs integration that encompasses Israel and the Palestinian authority.And everything that tended to separate both economies would seriously affect Israeli-Palestine cooperation, including joint ventures, Palestinian subcontractors and Palestinian exporters.Secondly, nowhere, in the agreements between Israel and the European Union, the borders of the State of Israel are defined.The definition of these borders is precisely what is at stake in the ongoing negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authority.Any attempt on the European Union to impose its own conception of Israel's territoriality would be like little harmful clumsiness for these negotiations and for the idea we have of the role that Europe must play in the region.Support the prudent approach that the commissioner has adopted and adopts on this issue, in the first place because it is not a simple matter.It is complex, it is always difficult to determine the origin and origin of the goods.And even more in the Middle East, because there is a situation there in which there are numerous joint businesses between Israel and the Palestinians, in which in some cases the products are manufactured in part in the Palestinian zone and partly in the state of Israel.But these developments are good, they constitute a good omen for the future, because if trade is done in this way in the Middle East will constitute the foundations of the peace agreement.Therefore, as it is not an easy and simple issue, we must be prudent and proceed cautiously.The second reason that explains the convenience that the Commission proceeds in this way is that if the European Union wishes to play a role in the area ensuring peace, it must be qualified as fair and impartial, and it would not be fair or impartial to rush into making a decision without letting the conversations and groups that are meeting to determine what the situation is both on the conditions related to the commercial agreement of the area of ​​the state of Israel.and its origin at the same time.	es
It is no longer sustainable that the community must pay the damage caused by individual people, often with criminal activities.We must introduce responsibility for those who cause all sorts of damage to our environment, because so it will think twice before carrying out crude oils with a oil tanker on the point of breaking.Over five years ago, in 1994, when I became a member of the legal commission of this parliament, I was assigned the drafting of the report on environmental responsibility.It is from that day that I await an initiative of the commission that gives me the subject to work.It is necessary to put an end to this scandal as soon as possible, and I hope that in February the discussion on this dossier is not updated for the umpteenth time!- (de) Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, after all the storm that marked the turn of the century should lead us to reflect on some problems.It has been clearly seen that man, today as always, is unable to escape natural catastrophes.Natural catastrophes have always been there and there will also be in the future.It is natural that in this regard it is necessary to prove solidarity.It is out of doubt that a pan -European civil protection service is needed, and a budget line for natural catastrophes must be foreseen in the European Union budget.But the most important thing is to recognize the principle that in the natural-man relationship is always the man who is wrong, perpetuating his mistakes sometimes for centuries.Nature never misses, because it can't make mistakes.The damage, in the case under discussion, depend on the housing density, the shape of the infrastructures and obviously on the many monocultures, if we talk about forests.It is evident that we must give all the help possible, but by doing it we must keep in mind that electrical and telephone cables in the future could be buried more often.We must shorten the cycles and guarantee the reforestation with mixed woods, more stable of monocultures.The most important debate in this context is that on the climate.In Europe we are privileged because we have the Gulf current and because this still works.America and Southeast Asian are much worse than we are in terms of storms.Fortunately, we have the Gulf current, but we too like the others are subject to the greenhouse effect, and the latter is partly caused by man, however difficult it is to demonstrate climate change mathematically.We must pay more attention to the recommendations of the Kyoto conference on the environment.We must reduce CO2 emissions, use renewable energy sources and in this context ask us what the health status of European forests is.Mr. President, I believe that what we must deplore before anything else is the loss of human lives.An irreparable loss.Secondly, we welcome the solidarity that emerged among the French departments and citizens, as well as the one manifested by other countries to France, the most affected state.Given the very little time at my disposal, Mr. President, I will limit myself to emphasizing two aspects of our resolution.The first aspect seems implicitly recognized to me by the commissioner, when asking if they are natural disasters or not.	it
Furthermore, in this regard, it must also be thought if it is not better to resort to a preallarm system, a sort of yellow card instead of immediately resorting to the red card, which will act as a fine threatening the survival of the company.Mr. President, intervening lastly gives me the privilege of being able to tell the commissioner that the majority of this assembly supports his initiative and that he has shown a total trust, in my opinion fully justified, towards the way she is leading the boat to the port.On this boat, however, we also want to do our part of rowers: and if we want to row too, it is precisely because we are all on the same boat.I therefore consider it completely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue that allows us to conduct in port, to finish and point out this very important reform.The various ideas listened to here could be grouped in three large categories.Firstly, the concern manifested by many, and in particular by the President of the Economic Commission honorable Randzio-Plath, to guarantee the absolute compatibility with the Treaty of this new legal exceptional system.I join this concern and I believe that the topic should be addressed.Secondly, the question of the certainty of the law by companies.It is true, Signor Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for the production of legal security.We agree on this.But it is not less true - as reiterated by all the members of this assembly - that the European industrial fabric is a small and medium -sized fabric, and that the Commission often plays a role of Auctoritas, legitimacy, guarantor of the legitimacy of the internal market.And it is in this regard that I wish to express my opinion about an observation made by the honorable Karas.There were only nine refusal decisions.But here I have to draw on my experience as a lawyer: who knows how many times a lawyer, with two companies and a project, in the light of an orientation expressed in a preventive way by the Commission ended up changing that project, in order to make it compatible with the rules on competition!This aspect cannot be ignored.Third, the problem of the uniform application of Community law.In this regard, there is nothing to add to the excellent intervention of the honorable Thyssen.I consider biodiversity a positive fact, I also consider cultural diversity positive, but not diversity in the application of the law, and in particular of the competition right that represents the hard core of the internal market.And here you need a filing work.Only in some countries, for example, there is a specific jurisdiction in Germany.Maybe this is a way to explore, but certainly not the only one.What we certainly cannot afford, Mr. Commissioner - and I would like to conclude precisely on this aspect - is to leave space and provide arguments to those who strive to present European institutions as something intended for large entities, to those who count, to the rich and not to the citizen, not to small and medium enterprises, which in the worst hypothesis - but it will not be verified, because it will take measures to avoid it -Contrast between them, with very long times, without any possibility of control except what the French call the Parcours du combant, that is, to take on a procedure that lasts years until the judgment of the Court of Justice, which as we know at present is oberated work.	it
In this context, the various references to regional cooperation with neighboring countries take on a significant political meaning.The agreement also is of particular importance because it will be able to and have to take on an exemplary character also for the other countries of the Balkan area.However, this process is necessary to be supported by a real political will of approaching the European Union to these countries.We know that for some of them, democratization processes are underway, in others the state democratic authority is yet to be affirmed, while others owe their balance to a military presence in the area.In all cases, these countries are aware of now on to have the possibility, overcome the difficulties, to create a concrete link with the European Union.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, honorable deputies, I do not intend to join the unanimous chorus of colleagues.I think the relationship is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy.In paragraph 4, the exemplary character of the agreement is mentioned.We know that, from Lithuania to Turkey, there are thirteen candidate countries and that there is only one black hole in Europe, the Balkans, and while these countries are denied the possibility of applying, we would like to make them believe that the agreement is miraculous.In paragraph 11 it indicates that symbolic measures can replace the political agreement, the political perspective that represents the fact of being a candidate.The report is not only a masterpiece of hypocrisy, but also an aberration, because, honorable colleagues, even if the negotiations begin tomorrow, the agreement will be concluded in a year and will come into force in three years.I challenge you to doubt that, among the Balkan countries, questions of adhesion in the due form by Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia are not submitted over these three years.A few days ago Racan announced the request for formal adhesion of Croatia for the end of 2000. I am sure that we will have other applications for membership and that therefore this beautiful work, this beautiful intellectual architecture will crumble, because it will be overcome by the events, as we have been in the last twenty years by everything that has happened in the former Yugoslavia.All this would not be serious if the problems we know in this region of Europe did not exist, if there were no problems that are addressed, but have not yet been solved by the new government of Macedonia, the problems of cohabitation between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, with the issues related to Kosovo, if there were no well -known economic problems, the problems of neighboring with a particularly powerful mafia in Serbia, if there was no problem, if there was no problem,consisting of a veto that should be denounced for what it is, the veto of Greece who, after almost ten years, continues to prevent this country from being called with its name, and I hope that the interpreters have not used the term ERIM when I was talking about Macedonia.All this is absolutely absurd.I think it is an offense primarily towards Greek colleagues, towards Greek citizens.It is urgent to find a solution to this issue.Finally, for a very happy case, I learned of a letter sent by Georgievski, president of Macedonia, to Commissioner Fischler, on March 8, in which, referring to the article or, having become article 49 of the Treaty, he requests that Macedonia can join the European Union.	it
"It cannot be that Mrs. Aung San Sui Kyi feels totally abandoned, also by Europe.My request is for this country to have a privileged position on the agenda.Mr. President, Mr. President in the exercise of the Council, Mr. Commissioner, the affirmation of the European Union in the world may not have as a determining element only economic power.An essential feature of what distinguishes us is the systematic reference to human rights on our part and for those with whom we relate.The European Parliament, which has been able to exceed the limits resulting from selfishness and ""national interests"" sometimes embodied in positions of Member States and even other European Union institutions, has played a fundamental role in the promotion and defense of human rights.Therefore, it can be affirmed, for example, that the European Parliament has never let the situation be forgotten in Eastern Timor, which could have been the worst enemy of a fair solution for its people, which always opposed the Indonesian occupation.Therefore, we still recently opposed weapons to Indonesia, a position that, unfortunately, the Council did not take into account.But it is not enough to avoid or end situations of outrageous aggression perpetrated by people or institutions against the weakest.It is essential that, committed the violations, its authors are not unpunished, whether they are, wherever it is, in Indonesia or in Angola, in Cuba, in China or in Burma, whether the author or a military, a soldier, a general or a minister.Do justice in Indonesia.Do Justice in Eastern Timor.President Wahid needs our support to face the difficult situation in hand.In good time this resolution, at the initiative of the PPE, includes an express reference to East Timor.What happened there in that country and that I in representation, on behalf of this Parliament, cannot be left without responsible and they cannot be unpunished.Talking about East Timor also has to remember the situation of tens of thousands of Timorenses refugees in Indonesian territory, in a inhuman situation, controlled by Indonesian military and militias, used as a currency.It is an intolerable situation that is urgent to put an end.Mr. President, some very short comments on behalf of the presidency of the Council.In the first place, to remember that the presidency is above all a coordination work, to search for common positions regarding the initiatives that the fifteen must adopt in the Council, remembering that the experiences of the periods of previous sessions of the Human Rights Commission have revealed - thanks precisely to that work of coordinating the presidencies - a great capacity to affirm the European Union as an entity with a policy with its own policy within the commission, which should be maintained.I would also like to say that the participation of the European Parliament in the preparatory works is important for the coherent statement of the positions of the European Union on the various situations, so the Presidency welcomes all the proposals with natural, in particular, in particular all the contributions that arise from the texts of the resolutions presented."	es
"We therefore ask the Commission to ask specific measures and the introduction of the principle of equality of opportunities in all programs for tourism and development of companies.Mr. President, gentlemen of the Commission, I would like to start from some words of optimism, who were offered to us in the communication of the high -level group in October 1998, when on the first page we wrote: ""By the end of the next decade in the union there will be the possibility of creating between 2,200,000 and 3,300,000 new jobs in tourist activities"" and added: ""Only by placing the right conditions"".I believe that the commission and this parliament are called to answer two questions: what are the right conditions and which can be, in this sense, the role of the European Union?The commission and the Parliament can help us understand first of all what we are exactly talking about, because the term ""tourism"", as has been remembered in the viceconte report, is a still ambiguous term, a sort of variable dependent on latitudes, climbing, on many occasions, by many elements of interpretation;It can be synonymous with vacation or can really be a place of production, income, wealth and employment.There are no data: we have no data on the economic impact, which still remains absolutely mysterious.We have criteria for the collection and interpretation of the statistics that are absolutely discordant with each other, despite what said a directive of the commission and the 1995 Parliament. I believe it is fundamental, in order to develop a strategy, to have a homogeneous reading and as rigorous as possible of these data, also to ensure that tourism is really able to produce employment.There is no automatism in this sense: often in the past there have been great accumulation of wealth thanks to the increase of the tourist industry, without this being paid an increase in employment.There is no legal basis and we believe that this is the great limit, today, of any intervention in the tourism sector.A legal basis translates into a coordination, programming and strategy capacity, which are essential for the tourism of the European Union to be competitive compared to the other markets.A legal basis would avoid having to draw, as has happened in the past, to the structural funds, a sort of Argent de Poco, however made available in minimum measures: remember that the commission communication indicated a sum of 4,700,000,000 euros in the last five years, which correspond to the cost of 400 kilometers of the highway.The possibility of giving states a strong signal is missing: a recognition of the legal basis of tourism would allow states to recognize the European Union with a competence that is absolutely sporadic at this moment.The Community measures that were indicated in the commission of the Commission find us absolutely in agreement: a taxation of advantage, i.e. tax measures that know how to offer that productive fabric - which, we remember, is formed for 95 percent by small and medium -sized enterprises, for an equivalent of 2 million small and medium -sized enterprises engaged in the tourism sector in Europe - of the really competitive conditions on this market;address, in the European Union, a particular attention to professional qualification, and therefore invest in training;Finally, commit to the transparency of the labor market."	it
In my opinion, such parameters - in particular the quality -related, which result from investments in the areas of further training, vocational training, adaptation measures, retraining of older workers - due to their persistent effects on the medium -term effects - more important and mandatory than the mere formulation of always controversial annual quantitative objectives for the creation or reduction of jobs.If, among other things, as in the program of the Portuguese Council Presidency, the Commission could initiate a new phase of social dialogue, geared towards a coordinated strategy of socialization and knowledge spread, in short on a strategy of employment and determining their rules, this could lead to progress in the way to the participation of employees in the appropriate and mutually agreed management of the restructuring andRedesign processes can be achieved.Thirdly, I do not consider that the decline in the number of workers due to the aging of the population are by no means to be an inevitable fate of the European Union, not only because of the scope, which is offered by increasing women's employment and immigration, but because the widespread tendency must be decided to decide from the labor market by not considering the coordinated reform of social protection systems, for exampleReasons of future pensions, but to the active use of the higher life expectancy, is geared towards an extension of working life.President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen!You, Mr. Prodi, come very much and very ambitious.You and your ambition are welcome.It will be necessary in view of the huge task that you expect.But in order to carry out all of these reforms and also to advance the legislative program of 2001, you have to be very sure not only of your own powers as reformers, but also the opinions of the others.You say you will undoubtedly come to this house and request more funds for the Commission, but the Commission must be completely clear about how thin the financial ceiling we are on.We have 1.27 % of GDP of the community.No more euros and no less.It will not be we who refuse these new means, you will have to ask the advice.This financial foresight is coordinated with millimeter.In order to finance your stability plan in the Balkans, a major revision of category 4 must be negotiated, and you will remember the huge difficulties that we had when the household was adopted.I would like to remind you that this faction, the PPE-DE, is reluctant to finance new political initiatives by sacrificing existing ones.The political priorities must be demolished by this parliament and the MEPs.Never believe that the reform of the household that you suggest will conceal the restrictions of the community's financial system.We do well to make all the efforts to be in the household on the mutual consensus, but be fully aware that the inadequacy of the means, the lack of financial autonomy and the poor budget execution are urgently to solve questions.So we ask ourselves: Does the Commission have the political will to solve it?Ms. President, the Commission's communication is well formulated, but so vague that all interpretations are possible.	de
It is not about this, obviously, because that quota would not be realistic.The report does not mention the deadline within which this quota should be achieved.To calm the spirits and reassure their lordships, I have presented an amendment to the resolution for which we simply take note that the Commission undertakes to make important efforts to increase women's participation in community research programs, which is even commendable.In addition, it cannot be noted that the Commission has written us textually that it considers it essential that a minimum of 40% participation of women at all levels of the application and the management of research programs is obtained.It is not a quota.It is a declaration of very legitimate intentions by the Commission, to the extent that it is its own programs and not the programs of the Member States, which would do well to inspire themselves in this good example of the commission and continue to deploy the same efforts within the framework of their investigation programs.Thus they are transmitted!.(FR) It is satisfactory that the debate on the report of Mrs. McNally, on the issue of increasing and facilitating the participation of women in the tasks of research and science, is the subject of a fairly broad consensus.In this matter, an improvement in translation, in everyday reality, of the notion of equal opportunities are both desirable, and I cannot do anything other than congratulate me on the application of a policy that will result in the satisfaction of the legitimate aspirations of women: benefit from equal access to scientific studies, get positions of responsibility really consistent with their results and capacities, as well as the rapid establishment of accompanimentFamily life and professional life.But this necessary realistic and pragmatic policy, which should focus on the suppression of concrete obstacles identified as indisputable factors of this inequality, must be based on the concept of complementarity, the only one that can justify a voluntary policy in the field.In respect for these values, which are the truly respectful of the differences, and not on the postulate of an equality of the sexes that its own contradictions have inside, our reflection and our future actions must be concentrated: nothing justifies to abandon themselves to the ease of a quantitative policy, founded in the practice of the quotas, contrary to the notion of citizenship with which the deputies of the group that are identified.whose probable consequences would have an inverse effect that seems to seek the report of Ms. McNally: that of the participation of women in the tasks of science and research in terms proportional to their value.If you have the opportunity to demonstrate their real merits, if they suppress the barriers related to the specific ones, and not in the framework of a conflict in which they would give the impression of fighting against the privileges of men, women will prove their interest in achieving the hatching of their professional careers, and will modify the imbalances that still disadvantage them.	es
My second question will be more technical, but it is important with a view to a transfer - as harmonious as possible - to the European Union of the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union.You have pointed out, in this area, the creation of three committees;A political and security committee that has been launched today, the Military Committee.Then you have mentioned your relations with the third members of the Atlantic Alliance or associated members of the UEO, but who are not members of the European Union.Within the framework of the operation of the provisional institutions, whose creation has just been decided, could you tell us, Mr. Alto Representative, what statute you think to the members of the Alliance and the states associated with the UEO - I repeat - that they are not yet members of the European Union?Could, for example, occupy a site of observers within the different political and security committees or the military committee?These countries are concerned about the danger of being isolated, and I want to state that I understand their desire to participate with you in the realization of this construction.Mr. President, Lord Secretary General of the Council, as you will understand we have followed in this Assembly with great interest the information that has transferred us about the result of the informal meeting of defense ministers that was held in Sintra and its significance in the process of European integration in security and defense.It is also appreciated that you have shared with this Parliament the telephone conversation that you have had with D. Álvaro Gil-Robles.However, in the field of foreign policy, I have the doubt of whether we move forward to the rhythm that the needs demand - as one of my colleagues has already said throughout this afternoon - without ignoring of course the difficulties you find.I am going to give you an example: on the recent tour of the president of the European Parliament to the Middle East, which you have mentioned, the different parties in conflict agreed to demand a more active presence of the European Union in the open peace process in the region.Do you believe, Mr. General Secretary, that the representatives of the community institutions and the governments of the Member States are acting with the coordination and balance that is required to those who, like us, aspire to mediate between two facing parts?I believe that this Parliament houses any doubt about it;I don't know if you share it.In that sense, as you know, the European Parliament has been working on the initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the community, obviously without the intention of replacing the diplomatic services of the Member States, but of complementing them and eventually contributing to their best coordination.I could ask for Mr. Alto Representative, a first reaction to that initiative, without impairment from which you can give us more detail in the Foreign Affairs Commission.Mr. Solana, in this plenary session has been said on repeated occasions that it is better to prevent intervening.It is certainly better, but it is not seen why Europe should not endow the instruments that allow it to intervene when prevention fails.	es
"In addition, a huge warehouse has been built, the building permit and, moreover, the company ""Drogheda Corporation"" is to consult the other infrastructure.How can the Commission guarantee that this type of development, funded thanks to the structural funds, does not jeopardize the efforts necessary for the conservation of nature in the region?Is the commission willing to interrupt any funding pending a revision of the regional planning plans?.(SV) The Commission is aware of the construction of this port, but it had no knowledge of that of this warehouse, nor of the other infrastructures cited by Mrs. La MP.The construction of the port is subject to financial aid from structural funds, and has the main consequence of dredging the mouth of the Boyne river, and the provisional storage of the sediment masses collected on the stegrennan vase leash.The perimeter around the Boyne estuary was classified special protection zone under the directive on wild birds.This means that any operating activity practiced in the river estuary, or nearby, must respect the protection rules that have been set for this region by the community directive on natural habitats.Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints in which the construction of the port would be said to damage the Stegrennan vase leash, which is now part of the protected area, and that the applicable protection rules had not been respected.After examining these complaints during the year 1998 and at the beginning of 1999 - a period during which the project did not receive aid from the structural funds -, the Commission acquired the conviction, during the summer of 1999, that the protection rules had been taken into account for the construction of the port.A detailed study of environmental consequences had been carried out.The most negative consequence of the project, namely the loss of the Stegrennan vase of vase, is only temporary, the entrepreneur in charge of the works being required to rehabilitate the site.At the request of the Commission, the Stegrennan vase leash was formally included in the special protection area of ​​the Boyne estuary, of which it was not before.To compensate for the negative effects of this provisional disappearance of the vase leash on the populations of birds concerned, it was also planned to improve other sites of establishment of these species in the estuary area.However, since the summer of 1999, the latter measure has been the subject of a dispute.The Irish authorities first returned to the initially planned improvement measure.Then they put it into force, following a complaint filed by an ecological non -governmental organization before an Irish court.However, the new provision included minor modifications which led to a new complaint.Given that Ireland has committed compensation measures, and that a number of other problems have now found a solution, the Commission cannot today propose to freeze financial aid from structural funds.Nevertheless, it is ready to examine with the Irish authorities the question of compensatory measures intended to improve certain natural habitats, in particular in the light of legal action which is still continuing before an Irish court."	fr
Since both legal aspects often overlap and violations of the Union budget are increasingly increasing, also committed by organized crime, responsibility among the Member States is unclear.There are also differences in the individual national legal provisions as well as lengthy to unfulfilled mutual requests for legal assistance.The Convention signed by the European Council in 1995 to protect the financial interests and the two subsequent protocols did not change anything.In order to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States.So far, only four have done that after five years.This standstill, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has caused Parliament to stimulate a European law enforcement agency.This should by no means create a transnational criminal law and judicial regulations.Rather, the goal is to equip the Union with specific instruments to protect their financial interests, in compliance with subsidiarity.With today's report, we revitalize this idea again and direct the request to the Commission to submit legislative proposals to implement this goal.The concerns of the Legal Committee from his opinion and the committee for the freedoms and rights of citizens, judiciary and internal affairs are fully involved.We speak out two recommendations that arise from the creation of Olaf and to secure its operational and legal efficiency, transparency and the protection of individual rights.To do this, we need - this is the first recommendation - a legal act in which the criminal offenses to damage the Union's financial interests are covered and leading principles are anchored.In an amendment, I support the proposal period for the Commission until September 30th.The second recommendation concerns criminal proceedings.The Commission, too, should - and also changed by me until May 31, 2000 - to be legally involved in the creation of an independent organism, institutionally connected to the Commission, to coordinate and control the proper investigation.The existing surveillance committee can only control the independence of the office's director.The proposal for such a legal act should contain an independent statute for this organism and define its tasks, which are limited to investigations and internal law enforcement of Olaf to the damage of the Union's financial interests and to its relationships with the national authorities.An influence on justice in the Member States remains excluded.The Court of Justice should take over the legality of the legal file.In addition, we are calling for the upcoming government conference to take the debate about the creation of a European law enforcement agency to protect the Union's financial interests, if possible, created on the basis of the study, which has now been recognized by well -known scientists and is now widely recognized, the so -called Corpus juris, as well as the following feasibility studies.Further support for this project can also be found in the second report of the so -called five wise men.The Commission, Mr. Barnier and Mr. Vitorino, as well as some Member States, are also open to the idea.I ask you, dear colleagues, to your positive vote on this report, which the budget control committee accepted with a large majority.In turn, we can set an example here that the parliament is active to prevent mismanagement and in particular fraud and, where necessary, be punished.President!I am pleased to speak the floor in the pronunciation about this report and to congratulate Ms. Theato.	de
"Who can ever want such a thing?Is it not among our responsibilities to evaluate and choose the ways to counter this policy?Europe is a community of law.Among the principles we are called to defend democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law.It is imperative, in democracy, not to judge the electoral results, but to respect them.We must therefore respect the decisions that the Austrians, for reasons inherent in their policy, deemed it appropriate to take.It is a matter of respect for the principles of the rule of law that the Presidency of the Council is not expressed as it has done, that is, in a way that is in contrast with the treaties.It is a question of political intelligence not to isolate the ÖVP, but to help it - as it is undoubtedly democratic, respectful of the state of law and European orientation - to make Austria remain, equally undoubtedly, a member of this European community.For this reason, the deputies of the ÖVP must receive our support in this difficult situation, because that of isolation is certainly the wrong path!(Applause) President President, as they say in my part, ""the Welsh always try three times"";As she has been realized during this debate, three times I have manifested the desire to briefly comment on a discussion that has undoubtedly proved to be of a very high level and, at times, even moving.Firstly, on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues from the Commission, I would like to thank you for the support and understanding that many deputies offered to the position taken by the Commission with yesterday's declaration.Obviously I owe an answer to those who have denounced - I repeat the used words verbatim - the ambiguity, the acquiescence and the fragility of the commission's opinion.The obligation to affirm, in the face of this parliament, runs to me that there is no ambiguity at all, nor fragility or acquiescence in the opinion expressed by the Commission, and even in the action that the commission itself has undertaken on the subject.In our declaration yesterday morning we explicitly declared (as the president also did this afternoon) that we share the concerns expressed by the fourteen Member States in their declaration on Monday.Secondly, we specificly said that we will collaborate strictly with all Member States to examine the developments of the situation in Austria.Thirdly, we expressed our willingness to defend, with courageous impartiality, the dictation of article 6 of the Treaty and the values ​​that are expressed to you, as well as our firm intention - in the spirit of article 7 of the Treaty - to ensure that these values, freedom, democracy and fundamental rights are not harmful.In all this there is no ambiguity, nor fragility or acquiescence.And when I say that the commission expressed this opinion, I also refer to my dear colleague Franz Fischler, who is Austrian and that, in adhering to the declaration issued yesterday morning, he once again demonstrated his integrity, his independence and fidelity to the oath that lent as a member of the European Commission."	it
"The relocation of the tax burden from work to the consumption of raw materials and mineral resources, on the other hand, provides a sustainable contribution.President!First of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis for the report, which he presented to us - not here and today, but in the committee for economy and currency.From a political speaking, it is two completely different reports.In general, we could say that the first report is a report by the left in which the social aspects are addressed in addition to the economic problems.The report that is now available to us and for which my colleague has worked very well in my opinion is ""hybrid"".Based on a structure with social aspects, the most important conclusions are withdrawn.What does Mr Giorgos Katiforis suggest and what can be concluded from the report?He offered us a demanding report in a hopeful Europe in which quantified goals for the desired results should be set.And Europe has progressed with the procedure of quantified goals.For example, why was the proposal to increase the employment population in Europe to 75 % of the population?A 60 % working population is very low compared to Japan or the United States, and with such a low employment rate we cannot produce the same thing as these countries.So we have to increase the employment rate through competitive jobs.As it was for the Lisbon summit, we also have to prepare the workforce through scientific training for the new technologies.In addition, investments must grow at a faster pace.The idea of ​​the Wogau colleague that the workforce must be flexible is an argument that is too well known to all of us.I would like to counter him the example of Portugal, where labor law is inflexible, the unemployment rate is below 5 % - and continued to drop in recent years - because the investments on the community average (undoubtedly with support from the community) increase much faster.Therefore, we are striving for a Europe with economic growth, but also with social considerations.President!Like many of my colleagues, I would like to thank Mr. Katiforis for an interesting report.If I read this and look at the picture drawn there by the EU economy, this is a very worrying picture in my opinion.The investments are too low, unemployment is still far too high and growth is not sufficient.That is why it may not be surprising that the euro loses ground compared to other currencies, despite the rumors of secret support purchases from the European Central Bank.The rapporteur finds that stability is not a goal in itself.I can only agree with that.There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination, but far too little about the factors necessary for innovation and development.In my eyes, the cooperation in the WWU is a heavy colossus that cannot keep up with the enormous flexibility of the economy.However, my conclusions differ from those of my previous speaker.I think you have to rely on the human factor, on the one hand through a macroeconomic policy that creates increased demand and new jobs and, on the other hand, - and perhaps primarily - through measures in working life such as further training, democratization of companies and good social conditions."	de
I understand that it is not a controversial issue that in the Declaration of the Council on the next session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission will not include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva conventions, and that this statement, to make it in a noble and solemn way, has been postponed for the plenary of the month of March.I understand that there is an agreement on this point.Mrs. President, this afternoon, in this camera, reference has been made to a series of reports of the BBC Today program this morning, in which it was assured that some of my colleagues are directing companies of their property that act as a pressure group or abusing somehow of their position as deputies of this camera.These allegations are very serious, and are completely false, malicious and tendentious from the political point of view, they were also disseminated with full knowledge of their falsehood.We are currently receiving legal advice.The interest record of my colleagues is complete.If we discover that a deputy of this Parliament or any of its employees has collaborated with the BBC in this drug, we will expose them to the opprobrium of this camera.That is exactly.We totally agree.b) Sessions of March 1 and 2, 2000 in Brussels Sustainable Urban Development - Rural Development - Equal Initiative.(FR) Mrs. President, ladies, Commissioners and members of the Regional Transport and Tourism Policy Commission, I have been commissioned to prepare the European Parliament's report on the Interreg III Community Initiative Program.When the issue went to commission, we study more than one hundred amendments and as of today, 17 more amendments have been presented, some of them already presented previously in commission.Before entering the debate of the content of the resolution that I propose, I would like to inform them about the elements that I have taken into account to guide my speaker's work.First, I want to remind you of the role of the Interreg community initiative, based on the principles of transnationality and innovation.This program involves a European dimension development engine.Interreg is part of the four community initiatives scheduled for the 2000-2006 period, and will feature the greatest financial endowment, that is, 4,872 billion euros compared to 3,604 billion today.The Interreg initiative, created in 1990, is based on the will to prepare European regions for the creation of a Europe without borders, within the framework of the achievement of the large single market.When the structural funds were reformed in 1994 and 1996, the PIC Interreg integrated new aspects that contributed to the development of trans -European transport and energy distribution networks.These programs have encouraged cross -border, transnational and interregional cooperation in the European Union, privileging a balanced development of community space.This is the objective of the Interreg III Program, whose orientations the European Commission submits to us today, in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations of the European Community No. 1260 of 1999 regarding the general provisions of the structural funds.It is based on three aspects: Chapter A, which organizes cross -border cooperation between the territorial communities of the border regions, interior and exterior to the European Union, based on common development strategies whose implementation depends on the Member States and the local and regional powers;Chapter B provides for transnational cooperation between national, regional and local authorities, in several member countries or candidates for accession to the European Union, within the fields of territory management, transport and environmental networks.	es
Thirdly, the EU and ACP countries have found an agreement on a new specific procedure to be started in serious cases of corruption.It is a real innovation, both in the EU/ACP context and in general in international relations.This procedure will be applied not only in cases of corruption concerning the resources of the Fes, but also in a broader way, in any country that sees the financial participation of the community and in which corruption constitutes an obstacle for development.It is therefore not limited to the activities of the EC.It is a very important aspect, in the light of the admissibility of public finances to benefit from the funds.By inserting this provision in the partnership agreement, the European Union and the ACP States transmit a clear and concrete signal together, which will undoubtedly be appreciated by European taxpayers and we also hope from European investors.Another new element of the EU-ACP agreement is that of migration.We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area.The new dimension of the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines adopted by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and the conclusions of the European Council of Tampere, in Finland, in October 1999. The European Union undertakes to define and implement an immigration and asylum policy based on the principle of cooperation with the countries and regions of origin.The agreement concluded with the ACP countries opens the way to new initiatives, in particular on the rights of citizens of third countries within the union, and to new measures aimed at facilitating their integration.We also decided to adopt illegal immigration measures.The EU and ACP states will start a process aimed at defining, in a framework to be negotiated with each individual country ACP, the methods and means of repatriation of immigrants illegally present in the territories of each part.The provisions also concern people from third countries and the stateless ones.These innovative addresses offer valid opportunities to improve public business management.The agreement also provides a good regulatory context to support the mutually strengthening effects of commercial cooperation and development aid.We have decided to start a process aimed at defining new commercial agreements that pursue the objective of the liberalization of exchanges between the parties and to adopt provisions on the issues related to trade.We found a solution to the difficulties raised by ACP States regarding the calendar of commercial negotiations.The negotiations will begin no later than 2002For the conduct of these negotiations there is a six -year period.We will take into account the economic and social limits of the ACP countries in two ways: first of all, promoting policies of social and human development that accompany economic and commercial reforms and, secondly, helping ACP states to play an active role in the international economic and commercial system through the strengthening of institutional capacity and cooperation in the field of multilateral fora.This setting will lead us to a regime fully compatible with the OMC.Economic operators will tend to establish closer relationships with ACP partners.National and foreign investments will record an increase and a greater transfer of know-how and technologies, factors that will impulse to the competitiveness of the ACP countries will occur and facilitate their gradual integration in the world economy.	it
"In my view, the Commission would show a balanced human resources management if some of these concerns clear, so that the liberalization of a sensitive sector such as postal services was carried out in social conditions as calmly as possible.Mr. President, it seems that postal services and mail offices are a very fashionable issue in Parliament at this time, and rightly, given its importance.Last week without going any further, in the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Westminster, the newly elected deputy of our European Free Alliance, Plaid Cymru, the Wales Party, made its inaugural speech on that issue.Also in the Scottish Parliament, a debate was maintained ago in which special reference was made to the function of post office, especially in rural areas, in relation to the provision of services and the continuity of rural communities.Liberalization is not the only potential threat to postal services.Postal offices in Scotland, as we have heard, take care of much more than merely dispatch the mail.Governments and some local administrations have been traditionally using agencies for the payment of pensions and other benefits, in addition to centers for the collection of housing rentals, local tax collection, etc.But as the modernization of public financial systems makes more and more direct money transactions to and to bank accounts, the viability of rural postal offices are threatened.If you close a rural post office, normally linked to the only local store, a serious threat to the continuity of the community and for social inclusion can be derived.Instead of allowing postal offices to be under impaired by liberalization or by modernization of systems, governments, and also the commission, they should be promoting and supporting the extensive network of postal offices and considering them as a good that can be used, to provide public information and services from an accessible place for the inhabitants.Mr. President, the postal service has the task of ensuring that everywhere, both in the city and in the most remote rural areas, the mail is distributed every day with the same rate for everyone.One hundred and fifty years ago Correos services were a public issue and, therefore, like public transport and energy supply, they constituted a fundamental task of public administrations.These tasks, very useful and recognition, gave citizens a reason to vote.They currently show a much lower interest in an administration that no longer deals with these tasks.I have heard a democratic politician in a town in the Netherlands: ""The mail belongs to everyone and, if they take it away, they will be stealing us.""Meanwhile, existing postal services were losing democratic control and more and more step was given to competition.New arrival companies are only interested in those aspects of the work where they can get the highest benefits with the lowest and low -price costs.The only way they have to be the cheapest for some time is based on quality loss for customers and staff.These companies have always existed, but before they were prohibited and now praise them as a sign of progress."	es
However, I still have a little concern, listening to the Commissioner, compared to the commitments which were made by the services in the Budget Commission.It had been clearly agreed - I do not say that it was a good or a bad thing, but it was a contract - it had been clearly agreed between the services of the Commission and the Budget Commission that there was agreement on amendments 4 and 7, that is to say that there was an agreement on the idea of ​​linking the mobilization, the implementation, the second trancheby donors.However, I thought I understand, listening to Mr. Solbes, that this commitment should be made in dotted lines.Mr. Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement.Yes or no, do you confirm the agreement that was taken by your services in budget commission or do you release this conditionality, which would be a break in commitment to us?No, Mr. Bourlanges, I think it is a fundamental problem.The problem is: how to instrument the compromise that we have accepted.What I have proposed to you, that I am still saying to you is that the Commission will make a declaration, in the decision of the Council, in the following sense: it will be decided in time useful of the exact amount and the precise calendar of the second tranche taking duly account for the evolution of the external financing needs of Kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors.In this sense, we believe that we respect completely what we have concluded.I simply ask the Commission, before implementing the second tranche, to come and inform the budget commission.I agree with it, and we will.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.Altener The agenda calls for the report (A5-0011/2000) of Mr. Langen, on the common project, approved by the conciliation committee, decision of the European Parliament and the Council stopping a multi -year program for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370 (COD)).Mr. President, I thank Mr. Langen - Although he is not himself here present - for the work he has accomplished to have the program adopted both in Parliament and at the Council.The project was long and difficult.We must continue to promote in particular the studies devoted to the analysis of the use of renewable energy sources.Even if the new directive conceals many advantages, it also has faults.An example is the use of peat.Peat should not be classified in the same category as fossil fuels.If peat cannot be directly classified as a renewable energy source, non -fossil, it must be defined as a separate class, especially for environmental taxation.It is not fair that we apply the same criteria to peat as to the coal for example.The promotion of renewable energy sources is a partial solution in order to remove the dependence on the union with regard to imported energy.	fr
Several questions remain unanswered, however.Thus, the program does not seem to give any priority to the fight against AIDS.The situation on this plan in Africa has today become so serious that AIDS kills more than armed conflicts.I hope the minister will devote a little of his time to this problem.Drugs exist in the United States, but the United States markets it at an too high price for African populations.I would like to ask the minister what he is doing exactly about the situation that develops in Ethiopia, where drought has settled, causing the loss of crops, and where, in six months, will inevitably happen again the scenario that we have already known a few years ago, with famine and people dying by thousands.Meanwhile, Eritrea and Ethiopia have war and European arms industry does not hesitate to send rifles, after which we will send bread.Mr. MP, you will understand that I do not agree with the reading you make of my colleague's intervention during the meeting of the Development Commission;There is no contradiction between these positions, on the contrary.Unless we show megalomania, we could not engage in our program of the presidency to a sort of exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginable situations concerning all the major questions posed, in particular within the framework of external relations.You will understand that nothing would have been easier.It was enough to take a glossary on development and to note all the points one after the other.We are responsible enough to see that we must only take the points that we can manage within the framework of our presidency and what is - we must be always aware of it - the capacity of governments within the Council.We must see what are the limits to management, in particular national indicative programs.The deputy mentioned the issue of Ethiopia, which is part of the national indicative programs, but as you know there are different community actions to combat AIDS.You are right on this point Mr. MP, the United States will probably not do better.Furthermore, in terms of development assistance policy, I think that Europe has no reason to worry simply because our behavior in the matter has nothing to envy that of the United States.The question of the deputy stems from the question of the problem of armament, it is a broader question of political nature, which seems to me not to fall within the framework of this question but that the council will obviously envisage in the future if it wishes and if it decides to replace it in a specific context.Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food products by the European Union to developing countries below the production price?	fr
On the one hand, if we establish shares of women, why not also create shares based on age or ethnicity, quotas of Catholics, workers, people with glasses.The establishment of social shares in favor of the most modest categories would no longer be strange than the establishment of women's shares.With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organize elections or administrative competitions.It would be enough to determine the composition of ministries and assemblies based on statistical calculations.The policy of the quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters towards politics by providing them, once again, the impression that everything happens without their knowledge.On the other hand, such a policy highlights a profound contempt for women.These must not have access to political or administrative functions based on automatisms linked to certain shares, but based on the recognition of their merits and their skills.Would you perhaps be honorable colleagues, so without pride that it is ready to accept a ministerial or elective assignment based on the exquisitely mathematical calculations of a shared system?Women are worth much more than a share.Only based on the principle of meritocracy will we improve the quantitative and qualitative presence of women within the decision -making process.Lady Minister, Mrs. Commissioner, I applaud to your words even if some of the male colleagues still present in the classroom has perhaps something to complain about.I know that there are also women who do not want to hear about shares or positive actions because they believe that these positive discrimination are humiline and stigmatics forever in their career.However, the statistics demonstrate it: positive actions, or shares - if they are not applied blindly and without discernment - have increased the number of women in the decision -making process.This is why it is legitimate to note that the use of the shares, as a transitory basis, contributes to balance the participation of Men and Women, especially in political life.I would like to seize the opportunity that is offered to remind me of the commissioner of the commissioner some requests and initiatives of the European Parliament to which his predecessor has not yet been followed and that they are more to the heart of the shares.First of all, it is about our report, approved last year on the occasion of the International Women's Day in Strasbourg, who asks the Commission to submit to the European Parliament for a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive relating to the implementation of the principle of equal treatment of men and women.Following the Treaty of Amsterdam, the need to maintain positive actions in terms of derogation to the principle of treatment equality that recognizes only an individual right and not a right that belongs to society that wants to achieve such equality democraticly.In the current state of affairs, it should be undeniable that the right of equality of women and men is a fundamental right of a democratic company that requires that equal treatment and equal opportunities are carried out through a set of active measures, including positive actions.	it
What proposed to us Mr. Giorgos Katiforis and was suppressed from the report?He proposed an ambitious report, in an optimistic Europe, which intended to establish goals in figures for the results that was intended to obtain.And Europe has advanced with methods of figures.Why, for example, was the proposal that the active population of Europe evolve to 75% of the population, when we currently have 60% order levels?An active population of 60% is very low compared to that of Japan or that of the United States and we cannot produce the same as those countries with such a low employment rate.Therefore, we need to increase the employment rate with competitive jobs.As advocated for the Summit of Lisbon, we must prepare labor with scientific training for new technologies.And we need investment to increase to faster rhythms.This idea that Mr. Von Wogau defends and according to which what is needed is flexibility of labor is an argument that we know very well.I would like to oppose the Portuguese example, in which labor laws are not flexible and in which the unemployment rate is less than 5% -and has not stopped decreasing in recent years -because investments increase (with community support, as is obvious) to rhythms much higher than the community average.Therefore, what we want is a Europe with economic growth, but with social concerns.Mr. President, I want, like others, thank Mr. Katiforis for this interesting report.When reading it, an image of the EU economy is achieved that, in my opinion, is quite alarming.Investment levels are too low, unemployment is still too high and growth is insufficient.Therefore, it may not be too strange for the euro to continue losing land in front of other currencies, although it is rumored that the European Central Bank buys euros in hidden to stop its fall.The rapporteur verifies that stability itself is not an objective, an opinion that I share.There is too much talk of stability, convergence and coordination, but too little of the factors that promote innovation and development.For me, the UEM collaboration is like a huge colossus, unable to follow the rapid movements of the economy.My conclusions are absolutely different from those of the previous speaker.I think we must bet on human resources, on the one hand, through a macropolitics that creates demand and new sources of work and, on the other, with measures such as training, business democratization and good social conditions.I see that, in these matters, the EMA project has its greatest weaknesses.We cannot lift European economies from above, as if we were a new Baron von Münchhause.On the contrary, we must mobilize workers and peoples in member countries.	es
In Tampere, the eye was made to distribute operational skills.We are still calling for a revision of the agreement to bring in better parliamentary and judicial control options.The agreement should also be viewed critically in terms of Eurodac.The parliament modified the contract text.It must be ensured that the council goes compliant with the procedure of parliament.Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet been launched on the other topics.We are currently waiting for it.Europe as a space of freedom, security and law has so far been an area without a clear regulation in important areas.However, we owe this to the citizens of Europe.After hearing the words of Interior and Justice Minister, I am optimistic.I assume that we will succeed in the next six months.President, Mr. Commissioner, revered colleagues, I think Ms. Terrón I Cusí's oral request hit the mark, because six months after the newly elected Parliament has been appointed, we have to be able to send out a decisive political message to European citizens.In my opinion, the Portuguese presidency can contribute in a positive way.In the meantime, we all know what infinitely large expectations our fellow citizens have in terms of freedom, security and justice, especially social justice.The disinterest of the citizens, their distance, sometimes even their aversion to politics force us to take concrete measures in view of their difficulties.This is the essential prerequisite for reconciling citizens with politics.In order for Europe to become a symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a brave and generous policy to get the weakest to help.A real plan to combat unemployment must be implemented, because this scourge is the breeding ground for racism, xenophobia, nationalism and right -wing extremist racist movements.The weakest are - and it is important that I go into this point - the immigrants and the refugees.In this way, the almost continuous inability to inherit the criminalization of asylum seekers can no longer be tolerated.Every asylum seeker must have the right to a fair hearing and appeal.Last week I was more by chance at Roissy Airport witness to a scene of hard -to -surviving violence, in which two young women who had probably entered secretly were deported to Conakry.They were treated like serious criminals.They were naked, were dragged over the ground on the hair and guarded by a Horde CRS standby police officer.The Portuguese presidency must put an end to such barbaric practices.On the contrary, our task is to accompany those who escape a dictatorship, to help them, help them and offer security.The Commission proposed the creation of a European fund for refugees.The parliament welcomed this proposal very much.Instead of debating the middle equipment provided for this fund, you should take the decision to set up this fund.The presidency and the council can concretize the points that were rejected in Tampere for inexplicable reasons, even if tampere forms an important basis.Likewise, we cannot be satisfied with the fact that xenophobia increases in Europe and discrimination is becoming more and more common without taking comprehensive countermeasures.	de
Finally, the demand concerns the future competencies of the European Parliament in the areas of competition policy and state aid for debate with a view to the government conference.In our report, as you know, Mr. Commissioner, the idea is represented that the co -decision procedure should apply to the adoption of basic legal texts on state aid.President, Herr Commissioner, my very worshiped ladies and gentlemen!My part in today's debate concerns the steel aid code.These are public aids in Europe that were awarded according to this code and which the Commission has checked.That is a total of 27 cases in 1998. The Commission submitted its own report on these cases.The EGKS contract will expire shortly.Therefore, the question that has to deal with today is, in particular, the one how the steel aid will be handled in the future.The European Parliament's decisions, which are presented in the report, are welcomed, including the decision to reclaim funds in a specific case and thus apply Article 88 of the EGKS contract.The competitiveness of the European steel industry is also the content of the recent communication of the Commission, which we have not yet advised in parliament.As in other areas, the general aid ban according to Article 87 paragraph 1 of the EC Treaty applies to the iron and steel industry.According to this article, state aid is generally incompatible with the common market.Exceptions are only allowed in precisely defined cases.According to Article 88, the Commission is obliged to control state aid.In 1998 the greatest case was the supply of equity to Preussag in Germany of 540 million euros.In addition, the Member States of the Commission have to provide their aid project beforehand.For the area of ​​the steel industry, the applicable rules were set up on December 18, 1996.According to this, aid in favor of the steel industry can only be awarded in certain, precisely defined cases.Research and development aids, environmental protection aids, social aid to promote the closure of steelworks and aid for final operating tasks for non-competitive companies.In addition, there is a special regulation of up to 50 million euros for the Member State of Greece.Obviously, however, there have been problems in the practical handling of the steel aid code in recent years, which were not completely discussed in the report.From the point of view of parliament, it is important that today there is already talk about a connection regulation after the expiry of this steel aid code.A softening of the existing basic lines of the steel code must not be decided.Nobody wants an uninhibited subsidy race in Europe.This would significantly affect the internal market even after the steel industry consolidated in recent years.Therefore, the parliament considers it necessary that the steel subscription code is changed with regard to the unequal treatment claimed by industry and that the Commission submits a succession plan to the Council.It is known that the Council has previously refused to decide on such a succession plan.This is also due to the fact that if the steel aid code expires, you can do what you want without the annoying control by the European Commission.We therefore demand that after the contract has expired, the steel aid must be regulated by a council regulation according to Article 94, because only this is the necessary legacy and clarity.	de
As a member of parliament, we must particularly emphasize that the process initiated to strengthen fundamental rights is gaining in importance than ever because the perception and inviolability of human values ​​as well as the rights of minorities, including the rights of all people living in the field of European Union, are an essential part of the principle of the rule of law in the European Union.Therefore, the charta of fundamental rights must also be legally binding.It must not only remain an explanation.The support of democratic forces in Austria is just as important, none of us want to exclude Austria.We know that most Austrians pay attention to these values.You also demonstrated;Not all demonstrations have taken place outside of Austria.There are certainly many protest voters on the move who have long wanted to change in Austrian politics.In my opinion, the parliament must support these democratic forces.I also appeal to the Austrian President to explore all options so that a government can be formed from democratic forces.Ms. President, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to emphasize the importance of an attitude, as the chairman of our faction, Francis Wurz, just remembered.I welcome the explanations of the Council Presidency and the 14 Member States, which reject official bilateral contacts with the Austrian government in the event of a participation in the government of Jörg Haider.It is all the more important that we point out to this as we are essentially disagreed with the policy of the European Union - their economic and social policy, their democratic deficit or the involvement of their Member States in the dramatic beam client.This disagreement gives even more weight to today's recognition: it is exceptional in that the risk of rebirth of a contradictory neo -fascist component in Europe is extraordinary.This danger does not affect Austria, but Europe.We speak of ourselves, not Austria.We know the social causes that, together with unemployment and uncertainty, help to stir up in this direction;We know the cultural adjoining causes such as peoples and racism, but we cannot avoid that the inability and the lack of will of those right -wing extremists can create an explosive mixture in Europe for settlement with fascism.It is about the Alpine region, about all of our countries: conditions are created from which a danger to democracy and European civilization can grow again.The chairmanship has made it clear with his statement that he is aware of this dramatic situation for civilization.Europe proves that Auschwitz has not forgotten;Europe meets a soul.Now, however, it should be consistent and act accordingly, and the first thing that would have to be consistent would have to be consistent, which in this case has shown an unclear and undecided attitude through which the importance of the opinion of the council becomes even more obvious.In this sense, the action of the Commission must be corrected.Mrs. President, values ​​and colleagues, as to what the democratic basic principle of respect for human rights as well as freedom and sovereignty of the peoples, which conflicts every new or old fascism, Nazism or communism - and all of the previous speakers have spoken about the sovereignty of the Austrian people - we find that this sovereignty is being denied by our parliament today.	de
Nothing to prevent the expansion of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the large companies from only to pushing part of the population into misery!If this report is due to earnings, it is that it has made it clear that the working majority of society has nothing to hope for with regard to maintaining or even improving their conditions of existence..(FR) By voting against this report, we speak for all those who have expressed their rejection of a world in Seattle and everywhere in Europe that is reduced to a pure market logic.We vote against this report in the name of the development of public services, especially in memory of the victims of the train accident of Paddington, whose death was not inevitable, but was in the account of the absurd striving to give competition where regulation would be necessary.This report is basically a primitive elaborate that is inspired by nothing else than the law of the jungle, because the competition cannot solve any of the problems that humanity faces at the beginning of the new century.Be it the balance of the biosphere, the promotion of culture or cooperation with the Third World, the uninhibited competition is a factor of regression and uncertainty.Do you think that the 18 million unemployed in Europe are victims of being too tentative of this competition policy?We are convinced of the opposite, and we also do not believe that the state aid are generally too high.According to which iron rule, according to which effectiveness criteria should you be?After Seattle, do you think it is serious to support a larger role of the WTO?So much throatness only fits the legal advisors of the multinational corporations.Report Jonckheer (A5-0087/1999).(FR) I welcome the quality of the seventh report on state aid in the EU, the annual publication of this report and the fact that the general directorate on its website spreads general information that is intended for the public.I am happy about the rapporteur's approach with regard to the state aid.Too often, one tends to scourge state aid as a violent measures.Certainly, an efficient competitive policy is a prerequisite for the proper functioning of the internal market and the economic and monetary union.Nevertheless, as the rapporteur emphasizes, such aid is often essential, not only as a contribution to the survival of one or the other company, but also for sustainable development (Article 6 EGV), to the service of general interest (Article 16) and on economic and social cohesion (Article 158).But of course they have to be checked, and this is the task of the European Commission.The aid granted annually by the eum-member states to the sectors that came into consideration in the period 1995-1997 to a total of 95 billion euros, of which 40 % of whom went to the processing industry.These aid has decreased significantly compared to the previous period 1993-1995 (decline by 13 % of the total amount and 3.8 % to 2.6 % of the aid volume for the processing industry).The decline in the aid is essentially explained by the reduction of the aid for the new German federal states.	de
"It must also be clarified what to do if state aid is declared illegal.How can we ensure that illegal state aid are repaid?There are no common regulations in this area at the moment, and we are emphatically asking the Commission to harmonize the regulations for repayment.This is the right way to create similar competitive conditions.As already mentioned by some colleagues, we also suggest a register and also a ""scoreboard"", from which it can be seen which level the countries have with regard to state aid.Here, Mr. Monti, we have taken up your suggestion regarding the internal market index regarding.This inspired us to propose the same for state aid.I very much hope, Commissioner Monti, that you will support this proposal and I look forward to your comments and your opinion.Finally, I welcome the XXVIII.Competition report of the Commission, which, like previous reports, was well done.However, as I said, our primary goal must be transparency and openness.It is important to constantly develop the transparency and openness of state aid and to direct our efforts to these areas.This is not least important for the upcoming expansion.I would like to thank Mr. Jonckheer, who deals with the associated problems very thoroughly in his report.He examines how we can ensure that these countries meet our requirements, but also how equal competitive conditions are created.Of course, liberal and green different views are about how the world should be, but we largely agree on the goals and will try to find a reasonable solution to our problems.President, Mr. Commissioner, we simply have two questions to answer.Are state aid for companies or agreements between companies in a market economy legitimate, and who should control these exceptions from the absolute rules of the market economy?At the first point, we clearly say that if the requirements of sustainable development that the European Union strives to be taken into account, state aid must be granted to the company, be it in the form of tax exemptions, of differentiated taxation or simply by direct aid.It is also legitimate that there are agreements between companies or self -limitation agreements that make it possible to reduce the negative effects of the competition with regard to social or ecological demands.So we say clearly and clearly, yes, it is legitimate that there is aid and that there can be conventions, but we also say that each of these agreements must be expressly justified.The Wogau report suggests that the control of the legitimacy of such measures are transferred to the national responsibility.We see a certain danger in this, but we will still vote for it, because we see that the Commission cannot do everything.We demand that the greatest transparency be kept and that the Commission granted more reconciliation to check the legitimacy of these exceptional regulations afterwards.Mr President, once again we debate about the competitive policy of the European Union.But - under what conditions this pronunciation actually takes place and what conclusions should we draw?"	de
The situation in the refugee camps of Inguschetia is bad and worsens;In most cases there is no warm meal all day.The Russian authorities no longer provide it, so it is the non -governmental organizations that take care of it.In Grosny there are currently around 20,000 people in a really desperate location, they have to run for miles to find something to eat.But there is something that can be described as a positive movement that I also want to inform you about.The European Council's representative informed me that the Russian authorities accepted the involvement of employees of the European Mission last night with the President and the Foreign Minister who are currently under the direction of the Russian authorities in Grosny, and that they were in negotiations with the incumbent presidency of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)employees of this organization could also be included.This is the only positive that I can transmit to you at the moment;I hope that in the next few hours we will receive more information from the representative, Mr. Gil-Robles, and above all better news about the authorities of the Russian Federation.Ms. President, ladies and gentlemen!I hereby come to the end and just want to repeat what I already said at the beginning.It is a great satisfaction to be able to participate in the activity of this parliament, to participate in the work that is carried together by all states and together with the Commission and the clear goal of which our European Union can participate in the international level with the greatest possible weight.Europe is not there to wage war somewhere, but to work together so that there is peace and stability all over the world.I thank Mr. Solana very warmly and give the word Mr. Poettering on behalf of the group of the European People's Party European Democrats.Thank you, Mr. Poettering.It goes without saying that a contribution by Commissioner Patten would be extremely appropriate in this debate.And we agreed to give him the word as soon as he wishes.Would you like to speak now, Mr. Commissioner, or a little later?(The Commissioner indicates that he wants to speak later.) Good, thank you.Ms. President, Mr. Commissioner Patten, Mr. Javier Solana!Usted no es una persona loca, Todo lo contrario.We welcome the quick progress that were reached after the Helsinki summit.It is known what important role you played.I am also pleased that in this context you mentioned Mozambique and the great humanitarian aid that can be provided with these means.Of course, we cannot talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya.My friend Jacques Poos will speak in the name of our faction afterwards.At this point I want to concentrate on Kosovo.The situation in Kosovo shows all too clearly that military means cannot bring about a long -term solution to the crisis there.The KFOR armed forces have performed important and invaluable services there and continue to do so, but armored cars and rifle defense cannot solve political problems and ethnic contrasts in the long run.	de
"The Council consults us and the Parliament provides its opinion.We want an intergovernmental conference, but not this.Is a CIG needed?Of course, but not of this type.It is necessary to go much further in the agenda, it is necessary to be much more daring in the themes that the intergovernmental conference will face, more transparency and greater democracy are needed.Greater democracy means ensuring greater participation of Parliament, allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes - its initiative capacity.It is also a question of placing clear objectives.The functionalist method has exhausted, for better or for worse.So far we have arrived with the functionalist method.We have undoubtedly achieved results, but now we have to make a qualitative leap;In politics, Mr. President in office for the Council, this means persuading the other community partners that now the worst would be myopia.Mr. President, honorable deputies, at this point, arrived at the end of the debate that I listened to with great attention and interest, I would like to formulate some reflections to complete the guidelines and speeches that I had the honor of keeping in front of you in the past few weeks, alongside President Prodi.Mr. President, honorable deputies, your two speakers, the honorable Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen, in their report, the result of an extremely precise and serious work, have proposed the adoption by the Parliament of a formal opinion, pursuant to article 48 of the Treaty, so that, thanks to the adoption of this opinion, the intergovernmental conference can actually start on February 14, as proposed by the Portuguese presidency.For our part, having, pursuant to the same article 48 of the Treaty, developed the opinion required of the Commission, we are satisfied that this conference can be started, among the other before what we had initially imagined.We know, and I am also aware of this, that the next few weeks will all be extremely useful.I would simply like to formulate some observations based on reading the opinion project and on the interventions of the oratories of the various groups.First of all, the Commission includes honorable deputies, the fears expressed by many of you regarding the breadth of the agenda of the conference.I understand this concern and the fear that the agenda is too rich.However, I believe that we can work, as I had already affirmed at the following Helsinki in front of the Constitutional Affairs Commission, on the basis of Helsinki's mandate.It is in this perspective and in the field of this mandate, using all the sentences and all the interlinees, which the Commission has worked on the development of its opinion.We have not limited ourselves to what are improperly called the three left-over.Like the honorable Corbett, I also do not like the term ""left-over"", which transmits the feeling that it is three minor or importance themes.Instead, these are three extremely serious, important and difficult issues, so demanding that Amsterdam was missing the collective political courage to treat them thoroughly.For our part - I reply to the honorable Seguro, who expressed a few indeed his concern about this question -, we were not satisfied with dealing with these three aspects, while considering them priority and worthy of being treated now."	it
"This is consistent with the fundamental principle of non -discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of our Union.Marinho Report (A5-0003/2000) :.(SV) The main task of the intergovernmental conference that is approaching is to reform the EU against the incorporation of new member countries.That is why it is obvious that we support the formal approval of the European Parliament to the realization of this conference.However, we believe that the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to necessary issues for the realization of the extension.We held the same in November 1999, and, for this reason, we want to refer to our vote explanation of November 18, 1999..(FR) In the opinion that has just adopted about the next intergovernmental conference, the European Parliament appeals to ""launch a constitutional process.""This will to put all nations under a legally superior text is also expressed in the first meetings of the scope responsible for the elaboration of such a called letter of fundamental rights, which is actually an undercover constitution.It is even expressed in the incredible derives from the European Parliament that today, through the vote of a resolution, aims to erase the result of the free elections held in Austria.The same will to bring nations to the level of mere subordinate administrative regions transparent in all pages of the opinion prepared by the Intergovernmental Conference Commission.The main idea is to generalize the voting by qualified majority, while the content of this qualified majority is modified to transform it into a double simple majority, of the states and the peoples, in order to increase the margin of maneuver of the commission and to reduce that of the minority states.The French will undoubtedly have much interest in knowing, incidentally, that the commission asks for the modification of article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to establish the vote by majority and the codecision with the European Parliament.Recall that this article, which deals with the transfer of immigration policy in the community field, provided that for five years the decisions had to be taken unanimously by the Council, which would later be in charge of appreciating the possible opportunity to modify the system.In France, in the National Assembly and in the Senate, at the time of ratification, many parliamentarians calmed down saying that the Council would be free to choose and that it could conserve unanimity.However, today, the European Affairs Minister who prepared the Amsterdam Treaty and that after the years it has become a European commissioner, Mr. Barnier, proposes that in the next intergovernmental conference it is decided that the council treats these matters by majority.This is the type of gear to which we are incessantly subjected when European integration is played with the Brussels institutions.The French must be aware that not only the end of all these operations is to make their country disappear as responsible decision -making center, but also that all means to snatch their consent will be used."	es
"The two great resources of the Atlantic coast, closely interconnected: fishing and tourism, have been seen harshly affected.There is a risk of losing the season and dragging at the end of the year an extremely serious crisis.Therefore, it was fully justified that our Parliament elaborated a new resolution to which our group has contributed very importantly, emphasizing some points that we consider on the terrain as of the first order.The first of these is that who pollutes must assume all their responsibilities.In our resolution, the application of two principles is requested: that of ""who pollutes clean"", since it is not admissible that the cleaning of the coasts contaminated by a cargo of hydrocarbons does not run in charge of the owner, but of the public communities, that is, the taxpayers, that is, the victims.The second principle is ""who pollutes pays.""Its responsibility, as required in our resolution, must also cover the sectors and companies of fishing and aquaculture.It is essential;This wants to say that the pollorer cannot pretend to limit the amount of the compensation of the victims depending on the maximum set by the fipol, that is, depending on the goodwill of the large oil companies.If the maximum limit of the fipol is insufficient, and is clearly underestimated, it must be increased.This is requested in our resolution.And if the increase is insufficient, the polluter must finance the rest.It would be particularly wicked that an oil company, whose benefits amount to ten billion francs this year, would refuse to indemnify 100% of its own victims, the vast majority of which consists of small businesses and workers.Malparada populations, Mr. Commissioner, hope that concrete signals of solidarity will be manifested at Europe.In our resolution, the commission is requested to take measures to contribute to repair the damages caused in the fishing sector affected by the consequences of the catastrophe.Blue Europe, the PPC, must now show that, beyond the obligations imposed on fishermen, solidarity is not a word that ignores.The European Union must also participate in the recovery of the environment in wet areas and affected coastal areas whose biological value is of interest to the entire union.Mr. Fischler has just told us that he would favorably welcomed France's requests, something that congresses me.In this essential theme of marine pollution, we must act as Acicate.Twenty years after the catastrophe of Amoco Cádiz, the laxism and irresponsibility in maritime security, along with their fruits: new black tides.This time inertia should not succeed.A general maritime security framework must be defined by respecting the principle of subsidiarity and finally ending with this infernal spiral of generalized irresponsibility.Mr. President, the economy of the West Atlantic is affected, covered by the Fuel-Oil of the Erika.Fishermen, ostricultures, mollusc breeders, tourism professionals, local and territorial collectivities are impacted waiting for aid, as well as the treatment of the helmet, which, apparently, still has escapes and constitutes a true bomb of delayed effect."	es
"In this case, obviously, no reciprocity is established in favor of European OICVM.We will also oppose the power of the states to increase to 35%... (the president withdraws the word to the speaker) Mr. President, this issue has a fundamental importance for Europe.A Europe that faces the imminent pension watchmaking bomb, must take all necessary measures to promote savings and optimize the benefits that the population of Europe can obtain from their savings.I greet many of the advances that Mr. Schmidt brings to us.OICVM are a success in the European Union.They constitute a sure product that can be marketed beyond borders.But the time has come to update the legislation.Mr. Schmidt has done an excellent work in this regard.It is no secret that, personally, he would have preferred that Mr. Schmidt's report had not suffered so many alterations as he passed through Parliament.But I appeal to this assembly to adopt a balanced and common sense approach on this matter.The radical measure that defends this report is to allow OICVM to use OTC derivatives.I appeal to everyone to make an evaluation of the products that these OICVM will use.We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculative purposes.We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce the risks and increase the benefits of the savings of the European foot citizens.Mr. Schmidt deserves to be applauded for having obtained the support of the Parliament for Over-The-Counter derivatives.We must not fear moving forward and reacting to the changes that the market experiences.Yes, we must continue to guarantee that OICVM provide a balanced and protected product for consumers.The report provides very adequate protection of consumers.But some of the amendments go too far as limiting the use of OTC derivatives.I think that these derivatives will come to join the ""Unit Trusts"" portfolio, which all they can do is help people from all over Europe to obtain high benefits for their savings.I greet Mr. Schmidt.Thank you very much, Mr. Kuckelkorn.Dear colleagues, I can already communicate a first answer on the issue of the curtain and the window.If we open this curtain, we will find a protective screen that cannot be easily removed.I fear, therefore, that we will have to postpone the experiment until the next plenary session.I will ensure that at that time we can find out how the room is with the open curtain.Mr. President, since its entry into force, on October 1, 1989, the Directive related to the OICVM has obtained great success, thanks above all to the very high level of protection that guarantees investors.The investment fund industry has quintupled its assets in the European Union, taking advantage of the directive and good image of the OICVM among investors.The cross -border marketing of investments within the European Union has known a strong development, and the directive itself has become an exemplary legislation worldwide.But it is evident that, after ten years and in view of the development of markets and the offer of new financial products increasingly sophisticated, the directive is somewhat outdated."	es
Will the legal basis be enough today to legal justify the creation of a new specifically community criminal law which, although subsidiary, will always compete, in practice and in certain areas, with the traditional and plot criminal law of the Member States?Given the doubts, would it not be more correct to include the reform of the judicial system on the agenda of the CIG, by introducing these proposals into the more general reform of the Union's judicial system, like what we ask for the European prosecutor?Are these matters not in the highest interest in revising the treaties which contributes to the solidity of the space of freedom, security and justice in the Union?Mr. President, the EU is today the subject of severe surveillance.Confidence in the European Union has deteriorated a lot.Energic measures are necessary to remedy it.We therefore welcome that increased resources have been allocated to Olaf, in order to effectively follow up on all suspicions.At the same time, we consider obviously the principle that people who have committed reprehensible acts against the EU have to assume responsibility.It is regrettable that the Convention on the Protection of the Protection of Union's economic interests is only applied by a small number of Member States.This is why we believe that it would be good to entrust the Commission the task of presenting proposals which imply the development of the already existing legal framework.On the other hand, I am not convinced that these efficiency gains have to involve the implementation of common European legislation or the centralization of the fight against this type of crime.In this context, I am therefore skeptical with regard to the creation of a function of European prosecutor, which it seems to me very difficult to carry out within the framework of the current treaty.We believe more in the Eurojust program, which allows national prosecutors to collaborate.The major problem is not the absence of prosecution against the authors of criminal acts committed at the expense of the Union, but the fact that these acts are so frequent and that they are so rarely discovered.The challenge for the commission and for ourselves, however, consists in finding the right dosage.The scams and the negligence that occur should not have the consequence of locking ourselves in a hierarchical and outdated bureaucracy, where excessive control exerted on details prevents evolution towards modern administration.We therefore welcome the offensive perspective that characterizes the Van Hulten report.The line to follow must assign itself to give each administration the responsibility of its own control.Our experience of a modern administrative functioning shows that the opening, decentralization of responsibilities and a truly competent assessment are just as effective as a bureaucratic and polent control.The major challenge here amounts to creating a modern and effective administration without losing anything from the point of view of legal certainty or our capacity for control.This requires specific training, more modern recruitment methods, and above all, transparency and opening of the system.The best protection against irregularities is an effective possibility of the administration.	fr
This has been discussed for four years.The Commission must change its internal organizational structures and strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of their measures.Ideally, this could be done by a special working group for the area of ​​land mines, which is equipped with the necessary financial resources.Furthermore, faster contract and implementation procedures, an extended multi-year budget line and a significantly improved management of the programs provided by the Commission would be required.A proper evaluation of the effectiveness of programs to clear land mines must be carried out in every country in which country mines are a serious problem.In my view, the problem of land mines is also concerned with many of the difficulties in the organizational, process -related and operational area as well as the financial administration with which the Commission and the Union have to deal.Do these problems belong to the past, or will we find that the European Union is still unable to achieve its goals in this relatively compact and limited area?President, dear colleagues!Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new EU AKP agreement is an important step towards more coherence.And it is good that criteria such as human rights, democracy, the rule of law, good governance are increasingly anchored in this new contract than before that not so much colonial relationships are not so much of the majority of our relationships, but that these political criteria have been given a stronger weight here.Because that is the prerequisite for any development.If these criteria are not met, then development has no chance.That, colleague Modrow, also applies to Cuba.I welcome Cuba to approach this process.But there is still a lot of change in Cuba.We all also know the reports from Amnesty International.It may be that you may see this as one of the last rulers of communism as one of the last rulers of communism and that you have problems with good governance.Nevertheless, this is an important criterion for the European Union.I want to address a second topic.We talk about coherence here.Many colleagues have given examples of the extent to which the different politics are not coherent.But in my view, development policy as such also needs a little more coherence.It is not coherent if the coordination with the Member States still does not work if there are sometimes very opposing projects by Member States and the European Union in developing countries.It is also not coherent compared to the European taxpayer if we do a development policy that is set in the Union's budget, but the EEF remains outside.President of the Council, if you achieve this 13.5 billion euros in the future, is subject to control of the parliament of the budget control committee, which is subject to mechanisms like Olaf, then I think they increase the degree of acceptance.I think this should also be a claim for the government conference: the anchoring of the EEF in the budget of the European Union.In our opinion, Mr. President, Ladies and Ladies, in our opinion, this text is pursuing good intentions, but we still did not agree to him in the committee, and in the plenary session we will not vote for two reasons, which by the way, which, incidentally, have caused us to provide some amendments that I would like to explain here briefly.	de
"Faced with this neoliberal globalization, under the domination of the financial markets, the requirement, of which our request testifies, grows, of another idea of ​​the world according to which the common law would be that which dictates the duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world.No one can ignore the challenge of civilization that constitutes the lack of almost a billion jobs.The need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development, access to knowledge.In this regard, all ideas deserve an examination and we believe that that of the Tobin tax is an important one, just like other forms of transactions which are possible.This tax can contribute to slowing down speculation, without penalizing the activities of the real economy, and making it possible to identify new resources for human investments and this as the UNDP assesses the necessary sum necessary to eradicate poverty, allow access to all to drinking water, satisfy health needs.While the debate is launched on a planetary scale on the capacity whether or not the policy of influencing the economic sphere, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political will to reconquer democratic spaces confiscated by international financial operators.And I would like to respond to the commissioner who said that it took a minimum number of industrial countries to achieve this.It seems to me that the European Union is made up of a large number of industrial countries and I believe, like Harlem Désir and several other stakeholders, that the European Union that we form can take the initiative in this regard.In any case, I believe that the European Parliament would be honored to echo the will of the citizens to master the world in the sense of well-being for all.Madam President, I too congratulate myself on the holding of this debate which was only too late.We know indeed that each generation, over time, has blindly paid in what one could call a dominant ideology, that is to say a set of prejudices accepted as they are by ambient conformism and which, however, end up revealing to the following generations how heavy they were heavy with dramas.Free trade and permanent beatification of globalization constitute, in our eyes, the dominant ideology of today, that is to say the great error of our end of the century, as dangerous as it was once the ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin, or, well before, the certainty erected in dogma that the land was flat.Our world is today dominated by a unique logic, I went to say a single God, that of money at work and not of man at work.With an amount of exchange of goods and services establishing 36,000 billion francs, that is to say the product of only four days of speculation, the financial bubble owes much to the productive activity of individuals.It self-suits in an escalation which continues to deny, everywhere, the humanity of man, that of the rich as much as that of the poor, even if it is the latter which, in the end, are excluded from most of the decision centers of the planet, which are monopolized by a tiny minority, which Jean-Pierre Chevènement was very well named: """	fr
I too would like to congratulate the honorable Hudghton for his relationship and support his changes to the original proposal both in relation to the question of compensation and as regards the development of a vaccine.I think the amendments from n.7 to n.13 are not acceptable and in particular I believe that amendment no.13 Not only is in contrast with the purposes of the proposal, but can make the situation even more difficult than it is, with the currently in force rules.With this I do not want to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish breeding.Mr Hudghton has already mentioned the final report of the joint British working group composed of government and industry on the infectious anemia of salmon and on the important measures for all fish farms, and not only for those affected by the virus.Secondly, since the proposal for resolution on the Katiforis report will be approved tonight, paragraph 28 is of particular importance.This paragraph asks the commission and the Member States to intensify the measures aimed at combating the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment.Thirdly, in line with what has been said previously on the collection of fishing data, I hope that the Commission will want to start projects and studies by looking at aquaculture in the environmental context;This is the approach that will have to be adopted in relation to the environment and not that suggested by the amendments by n.7 to n.13, that I hope the honorable deputies will reject.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, do not agree with the satisfaction choir expressed by my colleagues who rejoice in softening a directive that respects the precautionary principle and that adopts provisions to protect consumer health.The infectious salmon disease, caused by an orthomyxomicrovirus that decomposes the blood of salmon by making it die, spreads very easily in salted water through mucus, etc.The 1993 directive allows you to break down not only the sick fish, but the entire breeding, exactly as, when a cow is sick, for reasons related to the precautionary principle, the entire herd breaks down.Now we are proposed to soften this directive to ensure that all the breeding is not demolished, but only the declared sick fish.As for the others, the course of events should be awaited, acting according to the local circumstances.I think it is very serious to proceed in this way and, in this regard, I would like to attract the attention of colleagues because we cannot please us to affirm that a temperature of 27ºC presents all the advantages for mankind and that, therefore, men don't risk anything.And the women?Studies have not been conducted in this sense on human tissues.There is also a risk for the environment, because we know that in salmon the disease has a period of incubation and that, therefore, when these fish are consumed, they can be healthy carriers of the virus, thus constituting a danger.And it is not the only risk that the environment runs, as the disease is transmitted, as we have seen, to non -breeding fish.All this led me, together with colleague Patricia McKenna, to deposit some amendments against the Commission's proposals.	it
"We would like to go further on a number of points.This is why we will vote for amendments 102, 103 and 104 proposed by the Green Group, and which seem to us to further improve our position on these questions.Regarding the policy relating to the price of water, it sometimes happens that extreme situations present themselves which require that there are exceptions in relation to the principles decreed in the report.For my part, I believe that the amendment 43 proposal of the Environment Commission provides for the necessary exceptional possibilities, and that the formulation on this subject is even more satisfactory in the amendment 105 proposal.I do not think useful to provide exceptions applicable to other cases than those indicated in these two proposals.But opinions on this subject are shared within our group.The amendment proposal 107, which relates to this question, has been accepted by a number of us.In a global way, I believe that the proposal of the Environment Commission, as it was submitted to us in the Lienemann report, is valid, and that it can constitute a good basis to achieve a difficult compromise.Mr. President, each photo taken by the satellites proves that we live well the blue planet: this abundance is however an illusion.The very recent disaster that has happened on the course of the Danube reminds us that rivers and rivers are the vital arteries of our planet and that pollution has no border.Water is a renewable and limited natural resource.It becomes scarce when it is not well managed and when the geographic and climatic conditions are not favorable.Within the Union, this question arises in crucial terms in the Mediterranean region, but also in other European countries where we are witnessing the progressive drying up of wetlands.Sensitive, humid or arid areas, inequalities between states, inequalities between the different regions within states, climatic, economic, geographic, geological particularities, are as obvious as we wish to recall, but which must not lead to distortions of competition in the community.However, we have filed amendments to recall the importance of the specific relationship of water agriculture, a capital factor in occupation and enhancement of the territory.It is understood that the needs of agriculture in the South are much superior and that this specificity must be taken into account in this framework directive.It is not only in the States of the Union that we are looking for solutions to these problems: the countries of the Euroméditerranean partnership in October in Turin, asked for the southern coast of the Mediterranean a Marshall plan on water.Fortunately, we are there.In Europe, there are however droughts, desertification in certain regions, but also floods, and the directive highlights it.We have suffered recently in France, and also in the Rhine valley and central Europe.We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which will have to make the different uses of water compatible.But it is necessary to integrate into this new management the protection and conservation of biodiversity.The ""Water"" file will not be closed today.Indeed, the question of enlargement and climatic developments open up new perspectives."	fr
In addition to water quality, its quantity is also important, since this is not sufficient throughout Europe, especially in regions with very arid areas.I regret that the curator who is in fact competent in this matter, Mrs. Wallström, cannot be here, since it is of course an extremely important directive, in which the commission has been working for a lotYour adhesion.We have been working for ten years on this issue and this broad approach only became possible after a hearing promoted and organized in 1994 by the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Commission.From that moment to today's second reading, many people have worked hard on the issue in the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers.We managed to reduce the 243 amendments of the Environment Commission to 27, to which they have now been added again, however, another 30. As you can see, many aspirations are at stake and these are very diverse.Some propose to harden the provisions, others pursue greater precision, many are marked by national interests.Also in my political group, the European Popular Party Group (Democraticristians)/European Democrats, had naturally different points of view.Our line is to try to establish realistic objectives and solutions applicable in practice.Some of the amendments that myself and some and some other colleagues have presented in the name of our group improve without a doubt, from that perspective, the requirements proposed in the common position.Some amendments, which we support, propose to strengthen the negotiating position of the European Parliament in the subsequent reconciliation with the Council of Ministers.We clearly reject all the unrealistic demands, which undermine the credibility of the European Parliament.Among these I include the demand for a null entry of hazardous substances, that is, the requirement that it is reduced to zero by 2020. This would mean the end of any type of agricultural activities and many industrial activities.In this context, I would like to highlight once again that, in spite of everything, we have already achieved considerable progress with national and European laws on the protection of the current waters, however incomplete they are and although the member states have respected little.I just want to remember that we now have salmon in the RIN, something that would have been unthinkable 20 years ago, and that even in the Elba, which suffered a particularly high contaminant load, salmon will be re -introduced.Which does not mean that we do not have to continue making enormous efforts to continue improving the protection of water and to preserve surface waters and groundwater still in good condition, which will also take rigged, which doubts, high costs.Precisely in recent days many concerns have been expressed from the agriculture sector.Agriculture also needs to have non -contaminated water in sufficient quantity to develop.With the orientation that our group has maintained in the negotiations with the Council of Ministers it will be possible to achieve a favorable solution for agriculture.	es
We need more police forces;The available forces are absolutely insufficient.We need independent justice - which will certainly be difficult to set up - as well as funds for the High Commission for Human Rights.All this must be done, and quickly.If we do not quickly bring our aid, the situation will deteriorate and it could result from new conflicts and crisis situations.This is why I think we have done well to act quickly, accept the urgency and release funds.Only, we want to see the acts and successes won in Kosovo and I pray to the Commission to ensure the good implementation of these resources, in particular with regard to the development of the police and the implementation of justice.Mr. President, I first thank the deputies, and in particular the rapporteur, for the promptness with which they dealt with this subject.This will undoubtedly allow us to quickly pay help and to face the concerns of which Mr. Swoboda as well as Ms. Pack told us.It seems to me that three types of fundamental concern emerge from this evening debate.First, although we have progressed a lot in this regard, we could cite the customs administration, the banking administration, the tax administration, it is true that we still have a way to go.To finance what?This is the first point where there is a certain divergence.In one of your amendments, you suggest establishing more limited the kind of institutions to which the Union financing contribution.For example, amendments 3 and 5. Nevertheless, in our eyes, we should allow, in both cases, a greater margin of handle at the United Nations administration which knows the situation on the ground than us better.We believe that predetermining the destination of resources at the moment would create additional practical difficulties.Ultimately, we will have to trust those who, in the field, can make certain decisions better than we do.The second concern, which some of you share, it seems to me, it is Mr. Bourlanges who expressed it first, but others also expressed it concerns the problem of other donors.Does the commission make an excessive effort when others do not put their cooperation in work?Some amendments in your report go in this direction.Amendments 1, 2 and 4, for example.I would tell Mr. Bourlanges and those who raised this point that the fundamental problem does not reside in the mind, which we are completely sharing.The fundamental problem is that it is true that the distribution of the effort between the various donors is currently based on the declarations of the High Level Steering Group, but it is no less true that they have no legal value, they constitute only a political commitment.This is why we would ask, we have also provided a note to Mr. Brok in this direction, that amendment 1, whose spirit we accept, is written otherwise, so that it does not suppose conditionality to the supply of community resources.	fr
President!Dear rapporteurs!Ladies and gentlemen!I would first like to thank the rapporteurs who have managed to create well -founded reports in a short time.Regardless of this, my faction criticized the schedule of the work of the committee.The reports were presented late, and the treatment was also carried out with great hurry at least in the committee of regional policy, transport and tourism.This gave good chances to discuss the results of earlier programs, good practices as well as defects.In connection with the Interreg program, our faction would like to emphasize cross -border activities, in particular the cooperation that goes beyond the external borders of the Union.Important regions areThe Balkans and the Adriatic, in my opinion it should not forget the cooperation with Russia.My faction therefore once again points out the problem of practical control of the funds and emphasizes the need for better coordination of the Interreg, Tacis, ISPA and Pharse programs.There is still a lack of this, and the Commission has not yet submitted any specific suggestions to improve coordination.Parliament expects the Commission to present our committee as quickly as possible.In the practical implementation, the inclusion of companies, organizations and other players is of crucial importance.The cooperation projects require better planning, more precise control and more result -oriented implementation based on the experience already gained.The projects often got stuck, their efficiency failed due to the administration and bureaucracy.We also have to demand a binding commitment to the projects and the fulfillment of their share from our cooperation partners.Our faction renews some amendments that were rejected during the treatment in the committee.I also go into the Urban report, when the rapporteur's rapporteur is thankfully appealing to the minimum amount of 500 euros per inhabitant in the guidelines of the Commission.This cannot work as a generalized goal.Rather, this amount must be able to be determined in accordance with the conditions in the respective target area.This aspect is of such importance that it should appear in the conclusions instead of the justifications.Mr. President, dear colleagues!Interreg is one of the most European of all structural funds.Projects should not only be promoted in a region, in a country, but in neighboring regions in two or more countries.Unfortunately, this only applies to part of the money, namely only to the limits within the EU.But the regions at the borders to third countries need a functioning instrument for cross -border cooperation.The regulation is deceptive as if it were.But it's not like that.It is the case that the Commission has not changed the regulation for years, although Parliament has been demanding this for a long time.In practical terms, this means for the next time for these regions that it will be degraded into a deteriorated zone edge promotion.Parliament has called for a common fund for cooperation with the third countries to reduce the difficulties for working with the third countries.Nothing happened!The difficulties are delayed again at the expense of the affected regions.The parliament again calls for an improvement and cross -border cooperation, and we expect that a common fund will be formed and that the regulation will be changed again in cooperation with the other commissioners.	de
.(In) Mr. President, approval by the Council of the Project of Agreement regarding judicial assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union is approaching.The predominant opinion is that it was time.According to the Action Plan to fight against organized crime, adopted by the Council in April 1997, the work on the agreement related to judicial assistance in criminal matters should have ended before ending 1997. And it must still spend more time until the agreement enters into force, since it must be ratified by the Member States.In spite of the new norms introduced by the Amsterdam Treaty, which provides the entry into force of the agreement as soon as it has been approved by at least half of the Member States, I would like to urge the Member States not to escape efforts to accelerate its ratification.The experience of previous cases of ratification of the European Union agreements in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing.This agreement will not create a new or different system of mutual assistance.On the contrary, its objective is to improve the already proven and experienced mechanisms that have been in force for a long time, such as those provided for in the European Council Agreement on Mutual Assistance of 1959 and the Benelux Treaty.The project that has prepared the Council contains provisions on a series of issues that have been debated by several deputies.One of the outstanding achievements of the agreement is that, as far as possible, the Member States that receive the request for assistance must follow the procedures and procedures indicated by the Member States that submit the application.This is especially important regarding the possibility of using the evidence obtained before a court.Likewise, applications may be made directly among the competent authorities, without the need to go through the central administration.In general terms, there are two types of provisions: those that establish the obligation to provide assistance, such as provisions on the telephone and videoconferences, controlled deliveries and about the intervention of telecommunications;And those in which this obligation is not established and that only a legal framework for Member States who wish to cooperate in the prescribed manner, for example, provisions on mixed research equipment, undercover investigations and shipping and notification of procedural documents.The Commission welcomes with special satisfaction the inclusion of provisions related to new or modern investigation techniques, given its effectiveness in the fight against the type of crime that is more likely to take advantage of the opening of borders;Organized crime.It is too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations.However, we must not forget a common aspect to any action related to criminal procedures;The right to defense.I greatly value that Mr. Di Pietro's report, whom I congratulate for the excellent work he has done in such a short time, includes the right to defense as one of his main points.Currently, Member States are the only ones responsible for guaranteeing respect for this right, subject to the control of the Human Rights Court of the European Council of Strasbourg.	es
The reproach is not new.Since Europe has been trying to do something in terms of development cooperation, efficiency and quality of this assistance have been disputed.Hope for improvement is threatened with disappearance if the committee continues to refuse to look in a mirror.Why was the critical report on the consistency of the development cooperation policy was not disseminated outside?One of the essential conclusions of this report concerned the internal contradictions of European policy.In the agriculture and trade sector in particular, European policy is in contradiction with development cooperation policy.We do not manage to provide serious help in the development of the least developed countries.This is due to the differences in points of view between different countries of the European Union with regard to development cooperation.We no longer have to consider development cooperation as an instrument of foreign affairs or external relations, but rather as an autonomous political field.I plead in favor of a policy of cooperation in transparent, united and efficient development.As long as the European approach to the problem of development cooperation remains a cause of ineffectiveness and waste of money, it is preferable that this role is devolved to the Member States.Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to transmit as soon as possible in Parliament the document I have spoken of, so that we can think positively about the solutions that it would be possible to provide.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, I think this initiative is a relevant and completely supposed initiative.As many colleagues have already said it before me, we often see very contradictory situations between what we claim to do with the development and cooperation policy, on the one hand, and what we defeat, on the other hand, with other sectoral policies whose interests are contrary in terms of development of these same countries.We are not only talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fishing and industry.We are generally talking, what is more serious, of contradictions between our economic and commercial policies, on the one hand, and our defense policies, on the other hand.Finally, there is a set of contradictory situations.In my opinion, contradictions are not so serious in terms of community policies;They are more serious with regard to certain objectives and certain industries of a few Member States.We must be aware of it.On the one hand, we often adopt resolutions on the peace processes in other parts of the world, as we have done very recently in the case of Indonesia, a case to lift the embers in heaven, and then we note, on the other hand, that certain European countries supplied this country with arms and war material.This is in my opinion what are the most serious contradictions in this area, more serious than the contradictions of a certain incompatibility of sectoral policies, which of course exists.It is obvious that there are always contradictions between the different policies, even in a given country.It's normal.At the European Union level, we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various common policies, in this case in the development policy.We must be aware that these contradictions exist and that it is necessary to minimize them, this objective of minimizing contradictions being a fair and wise objective, at the base of the presentation of this resolution.	fr
"In the same way, as regards the judicial and criminal matter, of which we discussed today, I believe that they should not only be coordinated the different criminal, judicial and administrative legislative systems, but that it is also necessary to finally reach the formulation of common rules: what is crime in Italy must also be such in Britain, Spain and so on.I believe that we, parliament of the European Union, representatives elected by citizens, must be given the greatest impulse to reach a European Union that provides for the regulation of all sectors of citizens' lives, including that of justice, as well as that of pensions.We will vote against this relationship;In fact, allowing the cross -border interception of telecommunications and overturning the burden of test, the agreement will offer a favorable legal context for large -scale electronic espionage operations in the EU.This means making an electronic espionage system such as the American operation Echelon in Europe perfectly in Europe.This agreement will be a source of serious abuse against individual privacy rights.It is a terrible threat to civil freedoms in the European Union.The following points are also unacceptable for us: common investigative teams, supervised deliveries, infiltration operations, inaccuracies of the text on the extent of the agreement, failure to respect for the principle of proportionality and deficiency of democratic guarantees.Resolution on the strategic objectives 2000-2005 of the Commission, the president of the Prodi Commission has stated that ""the responsibility for Africa falls on us"" and not, apparently, on the United States or on some other great country.I worked in Africa 30 years ago;It was then a poor and underdeveloped continent, but later his problems worsened in a catastrophic way.Last year in Africa two million people died of AIDS, while about 200,000 died in war.In Zambia, 25 percent of teachers died of AIDS.In some countries, in the field of basic education and health care, children had better perspectives twenty years ago.Our Policies for Africa lacks consistency: there is an uncontrolled overlapping of initiatives, and above all the debit boulder still barrs the way to real development.It is clear that Africa is now a forgotten continent.In his communication on the strategic objectives 2000-2005, the Commission reiterates the need to make Europe a ""global actor"" who makes his voice heard in the world strong.What should be the goal of this global actor?The citizen probably expects an answer that provides for a better defense of European countries, since this is the essential and traditional mission of the political association.Well, a similar answer does not appear anywhere.There are general phrases on the ""strategic partnerships"" and the new possibilities for the development of the exchanges that would apparently derive from the complete integration of Europe.That the main objective is omitted is a very indicative fact that highlights one of the serious gaps of the European Union - a little known gap, almost always implicit, but which largely explains the disaffection of citizens.In the work program for the year 2000, attached to strategic orientations, there is a very significant passage in this regard."	it
During this visit, as requested by the honorable deputies and by others, I will inaugurate the European representation in IME.The deadline set for the conclusion of the negotiations is December of this year, but everything will depend on large extent on the goodwill and determination of negotiators.The agreement could enter into force within three or four years, taking into account the time necessary for the ratification in the parliaments of the Member States.I would like to express some comments in short on several points contained in the resolution project.We recognize that the agreement must to a certain extent serve as an example for other such agreements, even if we take into account the fact that we deal with different countries, each of which has its own identity and interests.I share the very widespread concern that each country must be treated according to its merits and do not force everyone to follow the rhythm of the slowest in the development of relationships with the union.This has never been the intention.The same fact that the negotiations begin with the ERIM, first of all the others, proves that we can operate the debt distinctions and that we do it.Regarding the regional help to which we refer in the report, we agree that technical and financial assistance must be partly intended for projects that have a cross -border or regional dimension and that an evolutionary clause must be provided on the perspective of adhesion to the European Union contained in the stabilization and association agreement, as this will reflect the position of the European Union on its relations with the countries of the Western Balkans as established in the conclusions of the Council's conclusionsEuropean Cologne.We firmly support the need to decentralize assistance programs as much as possible.As regards the provisions on the assistance of the European Union to Western Balkans, the deputies will know that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and stream them management and to bring together everything in a single regulation.I am aware of the apprehension that causes the ERIM and elsewhere the end of the Phare program in these countries and, above all, the loss of the Association to the name Phare.I took note of what the deputies say in this regard.I will examine the question again, even if it is appropriate to underline that having two ongoing Phare programs risks creating a real confusion.I would like to underline, however, that in any case we want to call the program, our commitment to the integration of erim and the neighboring countries in the European family is stronger than ever.In general I trust that the deputies share the satisfaction that I feel in seeing that Macedonia has achieved this phase in relatively short times.I hope that the other countries of the Region intensify their efforts to make similar progress.I look forward to other discussions similar to this in the coming years that I point out, I hope, the success of what we are trying to do in the Balkans, which in my opinion remains the most important test of what Europe can do at its doors.Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, at 12.00.	it
"Mr. President, I have had the privilege of listening to the commissioner to demonstrate on several occasions on this matter and I agree with his approach.However, I would like to ask something different.We have just heard the commissioner Barnier that he has a great interest in improving communication with the population and focusing the commission's information policy towards the main issues that the community will be held during this year.Would the commissioner be arranged to defend that part of the commission's budget is destined to inform and consult citizens on this issue of citizens' letter?It is very important that the population feels participating in this process.I know that the agreement will have a great impact in this regard, but does not have the resources available to the Commission.Will the commission study the possibility of using your budget to ensure the participation of society in this debate?The commission policy is to promote an open and broad debate on the letter of fundamental rights, not only with non -governmental organizations, but also with citizens, especially in the case of a project of repercussions as broad as it is the case of this letter.I can assure you that the Commission will do everything possible to promote the debate on the future letter of fundamental rights.The best means of making the most of it is to have a clear text, a text that citizens can read easily and, at the same time, a text that serves as a legal instrument.Both are not incompatible at all.The challenge we face is to combine both concepts in the final version of the letter.I am very happy to know that I can count on your support in this regard.Question No. 40 Formulated by (H-0095/00): Subject: Section 1 of article 6 and sections 1 and 2 of article 7 of the Treaty of the European Union section 1 of article 6 of the TUE stipulates that the Union is based on the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.It is evident that, as can be deduced from the statements made over the last years, Jörg Haider and the Liberal Party of Austria do not respect human rights or fundamental freedoms of nationals of third countries and resident minorities in Austria.Thus, can the Commission indicate when you plan to verify, by virtue of section 1 of article 7, ""the existence of a serious and persistent violation by a member state of principles contemplated in section 1 of article 6"", and urge the Council to which, by qualified majority, suspend certain rights derived from the application of the treaty to Austria, in particular the right to vote of the representative of Austria in the Council?Mr. President, lordship, allow me to begin by remembering the position adopted by the commission - and this morning the Roman President Prodi- has reiterated again regarding the composition of the new Austrian government, of which ministers from the Austrian Liberal Party of Jörg Haider.I naturally refer to the statement that the Commission issued on February 1, 2000 and whose essential lines I will begin by remembering."	es
It is important in my opinion that the Community initiative can be started promptly and that the report receives the approval of a large majority, so that the Commission is also induced to take into account the constructive proposals of the European Parliament.In fact, it should be remembered that Parliament has enrolled Equal's funds in the reserve, so that even the opinions of the deputies could be reflected in this community initiative.The insistence by the European Parliament is therefore justified so that any modification of the priorities is possible only on condition that the Parliament will be consulted again.I am firmly willing to make the Equal initiative worthy of the name.It should ensure equality of opportunities to all people disadvantaged in the European Union and prevent social disintegration.It should also prevent exclusion from continues to be a daily reality.Finally, it should offer everyone the opportunity to benefit from a community initiative, regardless of age, sex and origin.This is what I propose to do and therefore I invite the assembly to express a convincing approval to the report!Mrs. President, the simple fact of keeping today's discussion on the new Urban Community initiative constitutes in itself a not negligible success and it is no small thing for your rapporteur to be here tonight, since Air France has canceled my flight at 14.10, but I did it the same!A year ago, when the Commission presented the proposals for Agenda 2000, cut the Urban initiative.However, we politicians knew of the growing wave of support in favor of the continuation of this initiative in 2000. Parliament can therefore take the merit for the positive outcome of the campaign in favor of Urban and for having convinced the Commission and I recommend returning to its steps.Policy for urban areas has always been in the top of the community policies.In my Member State, by way of example, we are developing a strategic approach in a white paper and a government taskforce on urban areas has been commissioned to follow the problems of urban communities.Since eight out of ten Europeans live in urban areas, it is legitimate to help our communities less favored to face limited problems, such as indigence, social exclusion, unemployment, crime, drug addiction and all related problems.In my region, for example, Manchester, the Urban Community initiative has achieved enormous successes.The funds as Urban were invested in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the United Kingdom, Moss Side.Thanks to the Park of the Millennium Park for young people (Millennium Youth Park), we try to involve young people again in activities intended to revitalize their communities and also thanks to support for small businesses and social policy we begin to see a clear recovery in an urban community that was very disadvantaged.The work done in the context of this Urban program was then released to an extensive community through communication initiatives and information campaigns in local supermarkets and in the famous British pubs.We would like these examples of good practices to widen to the whole union through information and awareness campaigns.The specific guidelines of the initiative are essentially intended to promote local and regional diversity.	it
These services are also a strong and not negligible element of civic ties.In fact, as has been remembered on several occasions, is the postman is not the last contact in the territorial areas that define themselves in depopulated or disregarded, whether it is isolated geographical areas or the peripheries at risk of our cities?I quote as an example the initiative of the French Poste, who made the commitment to ensure the presence of interpreters and public scribes in the post offices of degraded urban areas.Without considering the loans in the induced, the European public posts currently give work to one and a half million employees, that the spectrum of brutal and uncontrolled liberalization jeopardizes.The European Parliament is proud to have managed to reconcile the opening to the competition and the constraints of a universal service that respects employment needs.We rejoice, but we want all this to continue.For this reason, we can only deprecate the fact that the European Parliament is held today on the margins of the decision -making process that supervises the destinies of the postal sector in Europe.It is deplorable that to date - as is underlined in the resolution - the Commission did not take into account the resolution of January 14, 1999 which imposed, we remember, that the European Parliament was associated with the processing of the expected measures and that the reliability of the impact studies on liberalization was increased.These studies are necessary to evaluate the effects of any type of uncontrolled liberalization not only from the point of view of the economic organization of the market, but also as regards the human and social dimension.The delays accumulated by the Commission affect the proposed calendar and the 2003 date must absolutely be reconsidered.By defining a sector reserved for public postal operators, on the basis of weight and price limits, the postal services directive allowed gradual and controlled liberalization.The drastic reduction of these limits questioned the balance between the obligations of the public service and the economic validity of postal services.In a context of globalization, in which the logic of profitability and profit is increasingly opposed to the concerns of balance of the territories and social cohesion, it is essential to remember our attachment to the European public service, be it post office tomorrow the day after tomorrow health.Mr. President, I intervene to protest, like other MEPs who represent Scotland, against everything that would decrease the quality of life in the most remote rural areas.The service and post offices are an element of vital importance for rural communities throughout Europe and, in particular, in Scotland.It would be a disaster if, intentionally or not, we were to start actions that would damage them.I don't think someone intends to do it, as I don't think the commission has decided to declare war on the islands of Scotland or Greece.However, the commission could involuntarily cause very serious damage to these communities.The point is to determine at what speed and with what methods the gradual liberalization of postal services should take place.	it
Social, economic and cultural phenomenon, tourism concerns the majority of European citizens, whether as beneficiaries or as very diverse service providers.Each year it is nearly 200 million Europeans who leave their usual place of residence for a time in order to do tourism, most often in other European countries.In addition, Europe remains the main tourist destination of third countries, even if it has to face increasingly strong competition and an increasingly diverse and attractive offer.As soon as the treaties do not provide for a specific legal basis for the implementation of a real community tourism policy, the European Union must help improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity, in order to concretize the potential that tourism offers in terms of employment.Vocational training, the mobility of the workforce represents essential instruments of an unemployment control strategy in Europe, in particular, with regard to tourist service providers, in order to meet the multicultural demands of demand and in order to provide appropriate customer services.Tourism employment is, often, highly seasonal and precarious, which is an obstacle to its sustainable development.It is therefore all the more urgent to acquire and disseminate know-how in terms of management and technology in order to promote new production methods and to promote a tourist offer that best meets market development.The adoption by the Member States of tax measures favorable to SMEs in order to reduce, in particular, the charges that weigh on the work factor would, as the report indicates, an excellent way to promote employment growth, in sectors with a high intensity of workforce and, therefore, in the tourism sector.This field of activity is also a decisive element of the economic and social development of the least favored regions: I am thinking in particular of the ultraperipheral and island regions, whose assets in the matter are not questionable.Let us not forget that, in these UlTraperipheral regions, tourism represents the first industry in terms of revenue.The revenue and employment induced by tourism contribute to a large extent to reduce imbalances and encourage a convergence of their economies to the average rate of community development.In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it allows greater awareness of different European cultures and thus contributes to the development of respect for European lifestyles.It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed wisely, in the long term, must represent for local economies a source of sustainable income while safeguarding and valuing landscape, cultural, historical and environmental wealth.Finally, I would like to emphasize the primary role that the European Union should play in favor of new tourism forms, in new places: I think precisely and in particular to introduce Europeans, continental, the most distant European destinations, the Ultraperic regions.Mr. President, we have launched a great debate on very little because, ultimately, the basic document is nothing more than a communication from the commission which follows the conclusions and the recommendations of a high -level group on tourism and employment.Not only is a question of little but, in addition, the document we are talking about is a bit old, since it is dated April 28, 1999, that is to say almost a year ago.	fr
I therefore address an appeal to those ministers so that this agreement does not frustrate, achieved with great effort.I would like to invite the Commission - and I am pleased that the Commissioner Solbes is present tonight - to promptly present this multi -year funding program, with the relative report, as the Parliament asked, so that it can be taken into account in the development of the preliminary project of the next budget, in line with what has been promised to us.Finally, I would like to remember that, despite having just agreed 35 million, we know well that it is an insufficient palliative;As soon as possible, we must reach an agreement on a multi -year program for the necessary reconstruction of Kosovo.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, I apologize for the delay, due to the other theme which unfortunately also appears again on the agenda today.The Commission for Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy recommends freeing 35 million euros because money can really be used for the benefit of affected people.Although the reasons for criticism - essentially the lack of the will to help Kosovo's populations - are not very serious, we will continue to be critical.The procedure would certainly find itself in a much more advanced phase if the Administration of the Council had not forgotten to promptly inform the European Parliament and to transmit the documentation through the official channels and had not thus prevented us from opening an in -depth debate on the matter.I undermine the administration to take the necessary measures to avoid similar omissions in the future.In fact, we give up on the necessary consequences from what has occurred only because the interest of the affected populations is careful.Before freeing the funds, however, it is essential to fix some conditions.The first is that the money must be destined for reasonable initiatives and not to those who could use it for other purposes.That is, the money must be truly assigned to the sectors of competence of Mr. Kouchner and not to others.Even if the Commission and the Council have taken on a different position due to the difficulties of realization of our proposal, we then believe that the other donors must also honor the commitments made.It is a mission led by the United Nations and it is not acceptable that the only one to respect the commitments is the European Union!In the interest of the victims, other donor countries must also honor their promises within the course of time.This leads me to support the need to deal with the question much more in -depth way, not only in reference to this specific project, but with regard to all aid for the development of South -Eastern Europe.In fact, they show that the European Union is willing to help allocating funds, but that the concord of political leadership is missing.We have such a large number of coordinators, called to report to such a large number of superiors, which we will soon be called to establish a coordinator coordinator.Perhaps, however, a meeting between the competent authorities of the European Union and the other institutions, from the ISCA to the United Nations, may prove to be more constructive, in order to sift and establish a new unitary and coordinated procedure to provide effective aid to local populations.	it
I would like to request what new initiatives can take the advice to preserve the interests of these farmers in the next world trade negotiations, in particular in the face of large-scale and industrial style production of the United States and New Zealand, where economies of scale make it extremely difficult for European family farms to remain competitive and where, of course, European food security standards do not apply.I fully understand the concerns of the deputy and I can see that we need an effort and a certain coherence including within the European Union with regard to this matter.It is also necessary to think of the consequences, especially in terms of financing and compensation for farmers.However, as you know, this question depends on the European Commission, which will have to develop it.The council has a limited intervention capacity in this area.Mr. President, allow me to congratulate me on the presence of the president in office in this enclosure.However, I do not think he answered my question which specifically concerns the treatment of the problem of the homeless and the accommodation.I also asked if the Portuguese presidency planned to meet non -governmental organizations actively engaged in this area.I appreciate and make mine without reservation on the need for multiple policies and a multidisciplinary approach, as well as on the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion, which can cause homelessness, not to mention drug addiction.My question concerns the homeless more precisely.It is to know if a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties to which the President in office alluded to the intergovernmental aid.I have the feeling that Europe can play a very active role in this regard, if only using forum where the Member States can exchange their experiences and the practices that seem to give the best results.Mr. MP, with regard to the possibility for the presidency to support the actions of non-governmental organizations, in particular in the specific case of the fight against the problems of the homeless, I would like to say that this type of initiatives is welcome and we can no longer open to any possibility of supporting them.We have collaborated with Portuguese non-governmental organizations and with some of their initiatives presented in the action of the Portuguese presidency, which we connect to all the concerns underlying our own program.We have no concrete specific initiative in the matter, we are therefore not closed to the hypothesis of an initiative of non -governmental organizations which would be offered to us in this area during our presidency.Initiative which must be part of the capacity of the council.But it must be understood that everything that could affect the right of initiative of the Commission will of course go through the Commission itself.Mr. President in office, you have told us a lot about the future: what the Commission will do, what the presidency will do in Lisbon, etc.And you made us an announcement that terrifies me, Mr. President.	fr
Instead, a minimum of certain rules is absolutely necessary, valid within the community, with an obvious increase in guarantees at the maximum levels, precisely also to precaution in view of the expansion.I think of what this community could be, these conventions or judicial relationships if, for example, a fascist country like Turkey adhered to the European Union: I would be truly perplexed.It is necessary to have a corpus juris - and everyone said - and common rules, especially procedural, which guarantee a state of common law throughout the community.It is obvious that this is mainly the subject of the CIG and that it is an aspiration for which Parliament can contribute in a limited way as it all depends on the Council and the Commission.I believe that this first semester, in which the commissioner is Portuguese and the presidency is held by Portugal, is an excellent opportunity to give a first impulse to this common aspiration.Precisely for this reason we are in favor of the amendments nos.78 and 79, which already prefigure a minimum of certain rules on interceptions and videoconferences.On the one hand, we look forward to the outcome of this vote with great attention, just to prevent there from being a total emptying of this convention - which, I repeat, already establishes minimum rules - and, on the other, we are also in favor of waiting for any proposal that comes from the Commission so that this minimum community right is finally realized.Mr. President, in the face of the growing crime phenomena organized internationally, the Member States should undoubtedly collaborate with each other as much as possible, indeed, the institutional conditions should be placed to start a concrete and effective process of cooperation in the judicial field: the process that must however face all the stages necessary to prevent them from being inappropriate to the detriment of the legitimate national indications in the field of justice,sovereigns, and above all to avoid forcing that end up trampling on the fundamental rights of citizens.It is therefore necessary to proceed with caution in front of a document like that of the Council where, as underlined also by the speaker, after years of discussion it is now claimed to resolve everything in a few months.Furthermore - and I agree with the assessments of the honorable of Peter - the text of the Council appears all too rich in contradictions, inconsistent formulations and gaps.And justice, more than other sectors, cannot obviously be treated in an inconsistent and contradictory way.In our group's opinion, the report also appears as a whole still very questionable, despite the introduction of some corrective amendments, sensitive to the protection of personal freedoms and respect for national sovereignties.In the report there are too heterogeneous disciplines, there is no graduality and we proceed by approximation.In conclusion, we will vote against this report, reiterating that the Europe that we hope must be a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that demand gradual and responsible reflections, as well as very serious insights.First the general rules must be established, the institutional certainties, and only afterwards can the establishment of practical conventions be carried out.	it
Finally, I would like to point out the question of liability.Not only with regard to the maximum amounts that, in my opinion, the North American must be similar.We have set $ 180 million;In the United States, one speaks of one billion dollars as an upper limit for compensation.I believe that we have to increase the current amount and approach a level that is similar to that of the United States, but that we also have to rethink the amount of insurance and thus the liability of the shipowner and involve those liability those who charter the ships, the owners of the freight.As long as one does not require the responsibility of the freight owners, the problems will not be finally regulated in my opinion.I come to the end, I don't want to go further.We will have the opportunity to do this.However, as a speaker said - and I thank everyone for their absolutely constructive and apt contributions - we must not allow us to say again in one or three years in two or three years that we would not have done what we should have done.On my part, I can say that after I have discussed this in the college of the Commissioners that the Commission is ready to present the legislative measures, the changes and the guidelines that are necessary to provide us with the highest possible security standards.The political will of this parliament - and I find that I can count on it - and that of the Council of Ministers.Thank you.Mrs. Commissioner.We have taken note of your willingness.According to Article 37, Paragraph 2, I received eight decision -making applications to conclude this declaration from the Commission.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 p.m.Storms in Europe According to the agenda, the Commission's explanation of the storms in Europe follows.The word has the word on behalf of the Commission.Mr. Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your words, especially for the very concrete suggestions for the victims who expect a lot from the European Union.Personally, a few days after this terrible storm, I asked you to request an adaptation of the Ziel2 areas from the French authorities so that all regions damaged by the storm are eligible in France and in other countries under target 2.I think that has happened because they didn't say anything about it.We all know that if you do not meet the criteria of goal 2, you have the greatest difficulty to get help.So it is better to help this problem immediately.They also know that this problem not only faces itself in the short term, but also means and long -term.Let me explain that.I was in Lorraine when this terrible storm destroyed about 20 % of the deciduous forest.Damage of 20 % means an enormous loss for some forestry communities.For example, we know that a tree is only fully grown after 150 to 200 years.The loss for these communities will therefore not extend over one, two or five years, but over a much longer period.	de
"However, much attention should be paid to your viability.For this, we must take into account natural base emissions that are not influenced, as well as diffuse emissions, difficult to control, which also substantially contaminates the waters.Mr. President, in the 21st century we have to assimilate the fundamental notion that our relationship with water has been completely modified.In the twentieth century, the aquatic medium was for us a free system for spilling and elimination of poisons, special waste, chemicals, etc.The consequences are already visible!We have to modify this way of thinking and recognize that water is one of the most important elements for our life and our responsibility in this aspect extends far beyond our current generations.The directive must also be explained in this context and the population must be able to clearly understand what we intend to do in this area and that the commission is proposed to do.Water protection is also in the background a social issue, and a decisive social issue.This is why it is necessary to strengthen the application of the principle that ""who pollutes, pays"", otherwise everyone has to carry the consequences.In view of the progressive deterioration of water resources, it is important that we do not limit ourselves to preserving its current state, but in tomorrow's vote we seek to ensure a real qualitative improvement.Mr. President, about six years have passed since our colleague Karl-Heinz Florenz, supported by Ursula Schleicher, asked that all policy be reorganized in the field of water.It has already been done.It is not an easy matter and I think that the effort made by Mrs. Lienemann deserves all our respect.The decision -making process around this framework of the Water is in a very important phase.The issue has been raised in accordance with the codecision procedure and in the first reading we have already been able to adopt important and more adjusted legislation.The community position that was raised at the end of last year already meant an important improvement with respect to the original proposal.It is very difficult to adopt policies in this area because the differences are very large.I want to say the following to my Spanish colleague: in northern Europe we have had to fight very often against floods, and also against water pollution, produced by the industry, while the problem of colleagues in southern Europe is usually that water must be transported through long distances, simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture.Let me abound in two elements of this proposal.First, quality.The Netherlands are greatly influenced by European policy on waters.A very important part, a third of the drinking water we consume, is extracted in the Netherlands from surface waters.The Netherlands are located downstream, in a delta, and therefore the quality of the surface waters that reach us is of the utmost importance.Another important point of debate is the establishment of standards on water quality.In a series of amendments, questions have been raised regarding the proposed standards, especially to the OSPAR standard for 2020."	es
The new element in the Urban II initiative is that it has been designed for small cities and for urban neighborhoods.This is important, because precisely small cities often have worse possibilities of obtaining promotion resources.On the other hand, however, in such cities, precisely, the problems that lead to the renewal become necessary are concentrated in a special way.In order to increase the effectiveness of particular measures, the number of Urban II projects has been limited to 50.I consider it important that this numerical limitation is not maintained rigidly, arbitrarily established, but is left to the hands of the Member States in how many projects they want to distribute the corresponding promotion resources.However, it is necessary to ensure that precisely in small member states are not only the neighborhoods of the big cities the beneficiaries of this aid.In them Urban II would be nothing more than a drop of water on a red stone, it would have a doubtful success and faded.It is also important, in my opinion, that they do not expand excessively, and consequently, the selection criteria for Urban II are not distorted.Precisely a catalog of rigorously delimited criteria is the previous condition for projects that are subject to promotion to have model projects and can be transferable in the future to other cities with problems.Finally, from my own experience in communal politics in a region, industrialized for many years and with many problems, I would like to ask for, dear colleagues, which especially support two points of the report that I consider essential next to the socio -political aspects.In the first place: the aspect of environmental protection is inalienable for sustainable urban development and, consequently, should be a general requirement for the financing of a project.Secondly: the prevention and the fight against common crime and against the crime of drug trafficking in cities must be included locally.These are inalienable for the elevation of the quality of life in cities and, consequently, must also play a central role in the Urban II initiative.Mr. President, distinguished speakers, dear listeners, I congratulate the speakers, who have made very documented reports in a short period of time.However, within my group, the calendar of the work of preparing the parliamentary commission has been criticized.The reports arrive late and, in addition, their processing has been very precipitated, at least in the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Commission.Therefore, we have lost a good opportunity to talk about the results of the previous programs, their deficiencies and the appropriate execution methods.In the field of the Interreg program, my group highlights cross -border activities and, particularly, cooperation with territories outside the borders of the Union.Important regions are, among others, the Balkans and the Adriatic area, but I think that we should not forget the cooperation we carry out with Russia.My group wants to bring out the control of the use of the funds and wants to highlight the need for better coordination of interreg, tacis, ISPA and Phare programs, among others.	es
The courtyard indicates that these problems now appear and it designates measures that can be taken now to mitigate the problem.However, as Marinho pointed out, we need more, but that must wait for the CIG.In my own country, mythology talks about the swarming hordes of faceless bureaucrats in Brussels but it is never mentioned the number of European judges.There are less than three dozen at the head of the European judicial order - which is far from excessive given the responsibilities relating to their tasks to the curriculum of the European legal system.Their great importance can be noted at the level of political implications of the delay taken in the resolution of the suffering conflict between France to Great Britain with regard to British beef and which has aroused so much anger in my country and so much frustration due to the functioning of the procedures for resolving the Union conflicts.This situation has been aggravated, this is what some of the people who advise me believe, by the French Code of Procedure which places non -French nationals almost in the impossibility of translating the French Government into court.The thing is certainly perceived de facto as being impossible.This situation offers a very unfavorable contrast to the British courts where Spanish fishermen has successfully brought to justice the British government in very similar circumstances.Mr. President, what is happening in France seems primary to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals for reasons of nationality and, consequently, this situation seems to constitute a violation of the treaties.I would therefore like to ask the commissioner, who was kind enough to comment on my remarks during the previous debate, to examine this and to share his conclusions in Parliament and to myself.I would be grateful to the commissioner if he could confirm, in his final intervention, that it will be so.Mr. President, on behalf of the President of the Commission, Mr. Prodi, I would like to make the following answer.The Commission takes note from the point of view adopted today by the European Parliament as to the request of the Court of Justice and of the Court of First Instance which aims, on the one hand, to entrust the court to examine certain appeals which are currently emerging in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court and, on the other hand, to increase the number of members of the court.On behalf of the Commission, let me add that I listened with great interest to the arguments that have just been put forward in this enclosure and that I very well understand the concern that underlies these arguments.The concern is legitimate.It has also been said that a delay in justice is a denial of justice.The Commission includes these considerations.Understanding them, I would like to continue my response as follows.As your parliament knows, the Commission is convinced that, without a deep reform, community legal bodies run the risk of being able to fulfill their mission within reasonable time.	fr
President Arafat will meet the Council of Ministers next week.The meeting will represent an excellent opportunity to deal with the need to take courageous actions in order to improve the Palestinian administration and strengthen the rule of law.The Commission is actively involved in such efforts.The Commission also increased the support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs.Last year we engaged over 20 million euros for these projects.The package included renewed assistance for people-to-people and cross-border cooperation as part of which Israelis and Arabs meet at the level of experts and non-governmental bodies.The deputies will remember that the European Union is the greatest financial donor in the field of global efforts aimed at reconciling the population of the Middle East.Numerous issues naturally emerge as potential additional objectives of Community support in the next phase of the peace process - among them, to encourage the consolidation of a settlement in the Golan contributing to the safety agreements and supporting the deserting work and reconstruction of the Golan Hall Communities.Syrian economic development will require assistance for the transition from an economy of war to an economy of peace.The reconstruction and restoration in southern Lebanon, the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict will also require significant efforts.We must also continue to provide our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole.It is necessary to find a solution to the problem of Palestinian refugees, which constitute the largest group of refugees in the world, reaching almost 5 million people, an indicative figure of the arduous challenges that await us.We must support initiatives aimed at increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the very low water resources of the region.Last point, but perhaps the most important, we must encourage closer regional cooperation in different sectors, bringing together all the countries concerned in a joint effort to deal with their common problems.It is already evident that the financial resources currently available for community assistance in favor of this part of the world will not be sufficient for the level of support that will be necessary in the event of permanent peace.I want to underline this point.I want to remember with a certain insistence on the Council and, if necessary, to Parliament, that we must not continue to allow a gap between our rhetoric and what we are actually able to do.I repeat that a modification of the Middle East policy will require a turning point in support that we will be called to provide and we will expect from us.I hope to add that we would like to provide it.We have made progress in recent months and weeks, as Minister Gama has said a little earlier, but it is inevitable that it will be a hard process of difficulty and disappointments.We will do everything possible to encourage a positive conclusion of the process and to cope with the obligations and challenges that will achieve it.Finally, I will repeat for some who entered the classroom in the last few minutes what I said at the beginning of my observations: I will not be able to remain until the end of the discussion, mainly for the reason I had expected that the discussion would take place this morning and I set a meeting on the Balkans for this evening.	it
The third military staff will be the representation of the high military of the fifteen countries, which will form civil and military secretariat with me, the task of which is to prepare for any operation with the help of the military committee that must be initiated in the area of ​​crisis management in the European Union at a given time.This crisis management will not be strictly a military surgery, but this military, the military committee, is also responsible for advice on logistics for any operations with a humanitarian character, where the inclusion of armed forces can be necessary.Today Mozambique is certainly an excellent example of the fact that one may not have to intervene from a military logistical point of view for military, but purely humanitarian purposes.We are working intensively, and if I would have told you a few months ago, when I was able to appear here for the first time, that on March 1, 2000 I would announce that the first time the committee for political and security issues came together, the military committee worked in a week and the next day the first employees of the military staff will be found in the building that we have in the European Union, many of them would have thought of it, the high representative, the high level of representativeMind lost.We have not lost the mind, we only worked hard, intensely and determined and without a doubt that we had the help and support not only from you, but also on the part of the heads of state and government of the countries they represent.Few initiatives in the area of ​​the European Union have been advanced with so much determination, momentum and commitment, as was the case with crisis management since Helsinki to this day.In less than two months, we started a mechanism in cooperation with the Commission.I would like to thank Commissioner Patten, who is here below us, for the support and the huge energy that he also spent on to bring all of these topics to the best possible conclusion in a relatively short time.Ladies and gentlemen!Allow me to go on to the second topic that I wanted to advise with you.We have already talked about the organs that we got on the way, but we have a fundamental obligation to sake our credibility: that Europe must be able to equip themselves with the military capacities in order to act in times of crisis management.I would like to repeat that the European Union does not intend to wage war with these military capacities, but to create peace, to participate in crisis management and to rush where war or conflict situations exist in order to contain, defuse and prevent them in the sense of the summit of Helsinki, which, as they are remembered, fell, with the participation of all EuropeanStates to set up a force of 60,000 soldiers who would be able to obtain their positions in 60 days - in two months - to prevent a crisis and continue this action for a year to prevent conflict.It is a large-scale operation, a big goal that we have set, but I can tell you that we are able to take this challenge that the heads of state and government in Helsinki have taken into account.	de
Mr. President, one year has not passed and the different way is already evident that this parliament is about to evaluate the first and second relationship.The first report has been widely advertised, solemnly discussed and used, as well as the controversies and the press news that preceded it, to massacre the president of the Commission first and then the majority of the European commissioners, even if they had nothing to do with fraud, bad management and nepotism.To read now what happened even a year ago it is clear that that relationship to everything had to serve that to do the work of truth or reform, as it is asserted today, so much so that this second relationship, which instead could bring much more substantial elements, was commissioned with the precise mandate not to treat specific cases, since it does not affect pursuing the offenses contained in this relationship.It is not interested in the large groups of this parliament nor the most of the unions, engaged in words in the defense of the European public function but in the facts occupied in the corporate protection of its members, using in an questionable way the large powers that are granted to them.Union representatives are found in the discipline board and in the Committee of the Statute so as to make the unfaithful official adamble and to keep the statute to be planted.Union representatives are also part of the competition commissions incomprehensibly, and I would not be surprised if members of the union already made a part of the Holaf, by bringing serious prejudice to this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee to be super partes.I therefore understand why we get together at this hour, which is usually intended for other activities and not to the debate, comparison and information.Mr. President, regarding his internal reform, the Commission is in a really difficult position.After the facts that led the old executive to resign, the expectations are enormous.Sometimes I have the feeling that the consent in the classroom is the greater the more radical the advanced proposals are.On the other hand, you cannot change the situation from today with a couple of changes decided at the table because the complications present themselves at the time of implementation, when it comes to defining the details.This is probably the reason why the Commission for Budget Control has also found more difficulties than expected in dealing with the problem, even if it has still come to a noteworthy result: the report presented by the honorable colleague Van Hulten, whom I expressly thank for the work done.If it will not be made even more bland with the adoption of some amendments, the report requires the Commission some clear and unequivocal objectives.I am allowed to expose the first to expose first of all: we do not want financial control to be abolished.Even if not in all cases, the controller must be able to continue to carry out preliminary checks for commitment and payment operations where risk or uncertainty factors exist.By renamed the Directorate General Audit, the current Directorate General for Financial Control, the Commission does not launch the right signal because, if it is easy to change its organization chart, things are complicated when it comes to reformulating legal texts, in particular the financial regulation.	it
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that an employee statute will be accepted as soon as possible?In the meantime, can you ensure that the provisions of the parliament properly use and that employees, as it should be, are paid according to the work they do for us?Without them we would not be able to work.Mr President, I also have a question about the rules of procedure.Are there any regulations that regulate demonstrations in this parliament and outside the plenary hall, so that the MPs can enter the plenary hall unhindered and be able to meet their obligations?If there are such regulations, who is responsible for enforcement and how do those responsible do justice to this task?Mr President, I would like to come back to the problem of the assistant statute that we always considered primarily and inform them that the Italian members of the PSE parliamentary group followed the request of our parliamentary group leader, Mr. Barón Crespo, and the contracts that we have concluded with the assistants have given the queest.I think this is a concrete step towards solving this problem, and I therefore ask the Presidium of Parliament to think about whether it should not ask all MPs to do so.Mr President, first of all I would like to find that I am fully advocating a statute for the employees.When I arrived in parliament yesterday, a document for the proposed demonstration of the employees in front of the parliament was presented to me.As all colleagues know - and many of them have contacted me in the past six months - applications for exhibitions and the like are initially sent to the Comart Committee of Parliament.To give you a neutral example: In this parliament, no commercial exhibitions may be carried out in this parliament for reasons that are obvious.After I received a letter yesterday, I immediately proposed the employees to carry out a meeting or a demonstration soon next month.The implementation of such events must never affect the normal work of parliament.Yesterday afternoon I signed a letter during the advisory of the Presidium of Parliament, which informs the employees accordingly.As I have learned, they were orally informed about this decision by the committee of the parliamentary group leader.So they were aware of the decision.We always have an open ear for the problems of the employees, and there is definitely the possibility of a corresponding event during the next conference of the parliament.But there must be a misunderstanding here, because you obviously received a letter from someone else you understood as a commitment.However, all exhibition applications are initially checked by the so-called Comart committee.As you can see, we have a lot of exhibitions here in parliament, be dedicated to different countries or whatever topic.This is by no means an attempt to censorship and in no way is directed against the very realistic and legitimate demand for a statute for employees.Thank you very much, Ms. Banotti.Your explanations can certainly help clarify various of the questions raised here.Mr President, we are dealing with a problem here.	de
"As for the amendment 15 on the definition of the ""independent"" concept, the Commission will be commissioned, as I have observed before, to seek a satisfactory solution to the exposed objections.Then I want to repair what Lord Inglewood has observed.He has referred to the border controls that exist in the United Kingdom and I would like to tell him that there is no obligation to any Member State, and therefore also for the United Kingdom, to suppress or modify the controls on the still existing borders.This is also worth it, as has been said, for the United Kingdom.This also applies to Belgium, where this case was recently.Regarding the observation made by Mr. Karas, perhaps allow me to punctualize that I have the impression that he is talking about the possibility that Poland workers are used to work in his country.The Commission would like to propose that a solution is given to this problem and that this solution was applicable to all the companies established in the European Union that use workers from countries outside the EU.The question is then if both cases should be considered.In my view it is rather an issue that is part of the debate on the expansion of the European Union and perhaps not of this debate.However, on behalf of the commission I would like to make myself available to Mr. Karas if I would like to have more information about this truly important issue.I am at your disposal.As an end point I would like to thank the Parliament for the most constructive debate about the most important aspects of these proposals and, naturally, to the speaker, Mrs. Berger.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Bolkestein.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00.Court of First Instance Mr. President, I want to start congratulating the rapporteur for a report, who, when reads, gives the impression that he only confirms and accepts.However, behind this report there is a long and effective work that has already had certain fruits: the incorporation into the document of the Finnish Presidency of December 7, 1999 of the commitment to expand the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to the study of the future modification of the organization, composition and powers of the community courts.Therefore, my express recognition to the work of Vice President Marinho.Mr. President, reforming the community judicial system has become a primary need if, in the future, justice is intended to be done in reasonable deadlines, if, in the future, the European Union wants to provide a justice that is up to the height of the political project that we have undertaken.Today - I have to say with pride and with satisfaction - we have had in this assembly a good opportunity to demonstrate to what extent we European believe that the European political project is much more than the internal market, a project that is founded much more in principles than on economic interests."	es
"The safeguarding of the social function of the market constitutes the discriminant between a liberalism tout court and a system that is according to the improvement of the person's quality of life.An aspect to be considered in the new legislation is represented by the economy of the ultra -repenering and insular regions that must be safeguarded.Therefore, I believe that it would also be appropriate to think about the creation of two fires of an external market, establishing a profitable relationship with Russia and with the Mediterranean countries precisely to make economies less peripheral.I hope and in this regard, I thank Professor Monti that the new legislation will be given a cut as possible as possible from the point of view of economic policy and guaranteeing its social function.Mr. President, competition represents the strength and heart of the European policy of the single market.A free and open market can exist only thanks to competition, delimited by clear and uniform play rules.This thought is formulated perfectly in the report of the honorable Karl von Wogau.But Europe is constantly evolving.Economies grow, the union will open to 10 or 15 other states.If we still carry on the current policy, the European Commission will not be able to cope with the amount of work.Therefore a modernization of competition policy is imposed.There is no discussion on this.That said, I continue to feed doubts about the proposed decentralization.I wonder how the commission, custodian of the treaties, can guarantee that in London, Palermo, Helsinki and in the future also in Budapest and Ankara decides uniformly in the field of competition.Legal disparities and the courts that will issue the least severe sentences will be needed will be flooded with causes in the field of competition.It is not enough to say that Member States have 40 years of experience.In Holland the competition authorities are just at the beginning, given that the market is very small and that at the same time, unfortunately, it is often defined as a relevant market.Contrary to what happens in Germany where a highly experienced Kartellamt exerts its skills on a gigantic market.The belief of the European Commission that almost automatically all countries will interpret the legislation in the same way could be defined as ""badly placed confidence"", and it is a mistake.It is necessary to get busy to obtain uniformity.I think of specialized national courts with the possibility of direct appeal to a special competition chamber within the European Court of Justice.A similar room in Luxembourg is essential to collect the necessary experiences.Furthermore, the vast economic and social interests linked to these causes do not allow a sentence to wait two years, as it is of use now.What does the commissioner think about it?I want to conclude my intervention with an important observation on small and medium -sized enterprises.To guarantee them greater security, the European Commission should draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium -sized enterprises, so in addition to the vertical exemptions, horizontal exemptions are also possible.By collaborating with each other, small independent companies must be able to oppose the great chains, therefore the European competition policy cannot have as its objective to make their lives impossible."	it
There is no justification in our society for terrorist actions such as the one that cost the life of the socialist spokesman for Parliament Basque and his escort.It is also a deputy elected by popular will of Basca society.We hope that these victims are the latest in a process B as you said, full of barbaries B and that you can find the way to ensure coexistence and peace between the Basque people.B (eg) lady president, on behalf of the confederal group of the European unitary left/left Nordic left, I wish to combine my voice with that of colleagues who express their pain for the attack, really perverse and cruel, which occurred in the Basque Country, which place their condolences to the families and condemn with determination actions that come from very far and to which we must end.One day the ETA terrorist organization killed some policemen;Then he assassinated the military;So he exploded a bomb in a supermarket killing men, women and children;Another day, he killed a general commander, Quintana Lacaci, in the streets of Madrid, who defended democracy on February 23;Another day more, assassinated the spokesman for the Popular Party at the Municipality of San Sebastián, Gregorio Ordóñez;It was therefore the turn of the university, in the faculty in which a professor of constitutional law taught Francisco Tomás y Valiente, killed with absolute coldness.A few days ago, after assassinating Lieutenant Colonel Blanco, this organization killed in this infamous way the socialist deputy Fernando Buasa, spokesperson at the Parliament of Vitoria, and his escort Jorge Díez, belonging to the Basque autonomous police.I want to reiterate that those who kill, like the ETA terrorist organization, must be sentenced, however those who give support and understanding to these attacks must also be sentenced.These people and organizations are useless to ask to take the path of democracy from one day to another.We must appeal to society as a whole, especially to democratic parties, regardless of their national or nationalist dimension, regardless of their Europeanist dimension.However, we must also complain that there are organizations that keep silent, people who silence and others who only complain about the dead as if they were the consequence of a road accident.All this must be said here with a very high voice, so that the voice of all European democrats can join and be heard in the Basque Country saying that the hour has come not to leave, not to separate and not to kill.It is time to share;Share the Basque Country, share Spain, share Europe.This is the only way, lady president.For this we give you our total support.Mrs. President, on behalf of the Union group for Europe of the Nations I express the pain for the victims and the rebellion against terrorism and against those who protect it.I think we are faced with a human tragedy, thinking of family and friends;A political tragedy, thinking of the political family to which they belong, but also of a cultural tragedy because the culture of death and violence against the culture of respect for others, democracy and democratic life is increasingly stronger.	it
I have no doubt about it and believe that it is an essential element.In this context, I also wanted to point out that we have to be careful what we say.Last week, the new finance minister of the Austrian coalition spoke of the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theater.We, which we had to live under dictatorial conditions, know that there can be a dictatorship with a sham parliament.We know there is no democracy without a living parliament.I think such a language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it from here.With regard to the four major priorities that President President PRODI systematically referred to, I would say that we completely agree with the analysis of the challenges.But I would like to point out the commission that there is a change in priorities for the socialist group.In our opinion, the top priority of the economic and social-political agenda, which includes what is also called quality of life in its priorities, that is, the rights of citizens as consumers and also as people.This deals with questions that we always assume as given, but do not emphasize sufficiently, for example about the European social model and its adaptation to new circumstances, the consumer rights and the protection of the environment and for sustainable development.If there is talk of the commitment to full employment, it must be assumed that full employment no longer means the same thing today as in the Beveridge Epoche at the end of the Second World War, namely work for the male head of the family.One has to assume the equality of the sexes, from the famous gender mainstreaming, which is one of the topics less treated in the Prodi program.This presupposes that we give priority to gender equality, the adaptation of the social model and, above all, the clear fight against populism in which our economic and social cohesion is threatened.This must also enjoy the highest priority in the work of the Commission.And it has to go hand in hand with a clear struggle against racism and intolerance to provide practical confirmation that the Union has developed into an attraction for the rest of the world and due to its prosperity and its outdated population structure.In my opinion, this must be the main goal that we have to follow.Here I would add another element, namely the economic government, with a unit currency - I believe that it prevails.This is also a question in which the Commission has to progress.With regard to the ambitious goals and especially with regard to something important that the Commission did, namely to decide on the expansion and integration process in the course of a negotiation and integration process, I would of course want my faction - that one would be more clear in connection with the revision of the Agenda 2000.Does the commission believe that there will be no revision until the end?And we also consider the stress to be a key topic.In my opinion, a theoretical consideration can be very interesting about governing in general.	de
"My group is delighted that the ""Social Affairs"" council, from the end of last year, gave its green light to a better cooperation strategy and that, moreover, a group of senior officials has already received the mission of presenting a first report to the Council in June 2000. But we would like, as Parliament and especially as a social democratic group, which Lisbon is now making an additional step.It is very important that this European Parliament pleads, through the report of our colleague, for a truly European strategy of social convergence, by analogy with what has been implemented for employment via the Luxembourg strategy, a strategy, therefore, endowed with community objectives, guidelines, national action plans and services assessments.We believe that this track is ambitious, but however accessible.It is indeed obvious that the harmonization of social security at European level is not realistic.Systems, in terms of financing and organization, are too diversified to do this and this is also an important reason why social protection barely leads to the European agenda.This is also the reason why scenarios such as the thirteenth Member State of Dany Peeters or the European Social Serpent have barely taken off from the ground.But this new track is particularly interesting.The employment strategy has shown that it was able to operate and social convergence is also necessary, because our social security systems face the same challenges and, at the UEM era, social security systems threatens to become an element of social competition.But let me point out a point in the name of my group: social convergence strategies can in no case constitute an alternative to social legislation.They can only serve as a very useful complement to what we put on and what we expect from the Commission with regard to social legislation.I think it is also good that the European Parliament tries to convince the Council to make the community strategy concretize as soon as the Lisbon meeting and to launch, at the beginning of 2001, an annual procedure aimed at reducing the poverty rate.I am happy that the European Parliament supports this idea of ​​my group and we hope, Madam Commissioner, that we will also benefit from your support.Finally, we insist that the European Parliament and the social partners as well as social NGOs are closely involved in this process.Only a broad and democratic basis will be able to offer guarantees for the success of this strategy and we hope for your support.Mr. President, the formulation of the four main objectives that the governments of the EU member states accepted in November of the past year and which were mentioned today is so vast that everyone should be able to approve them.I remind you: there is the idea that all work must be worth being carried out in order to ensure a guaranteed income, the certainty of being able to provide pensions and the need to make the regime of sustainable pensions, the promotion of social integration and the guarantee of sustainable and high quality health care.On the other hand, we could only derive an intellectual benefit from the creation of a group of high -level civil servants, which would be the hub for the exchange of experiences in terms of coordination and evaluation of progress made within the framework of social policy and that of the job market."	fr
Evidently the Commission has considered the question and I am pleased that the relationships presented to date have examined the problem with such attention.I would like to emphasize, however, that concern for weapons with depleted uranium concerns the way they are used.The uranium they contain is spread in the air, it is inhaled and therefore could have on the population of Kosovo that has breathed it much more long -term effects than those that has been possible for now possible.This is in fact what would have happened after the use of weapons with impoverished uranium in the Gulf War.I would therefore like to ask the Commission if it is willing to consider the possibility of continuing the monitoring checks and for how long it would be willing to monitor the long -term effects not only of the weapons with depleted uranium but also on other environmental effects that we know have occurred at least locally in Kosovo.How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons?Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your complementary question.We must reaffirm that it is not yet confirmed that the depleted uranium has been used in the conflict and in the renovation operations in Kosovo, the presence of depleted uranium has not been found.However, the symptoms and problems of which she is talking could arise and could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium, the same report nods you.No cross -border effects have been detected and the majority of weapons were used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Iugoslavia.The problem is that access to the area in question is restricted due to the current political isolation of the country.A great responsibility belongs to the United Nations, because they are the recipient of the relationship and therefore they must take on their responsibility.However, through the environmental and regional restoration plan we can continue to carry out monitoring actions and to provide our assistance and for the moment this is the context in which the union can operate.It is important to continue to follow the situation and among other things this offers the Member States and also to the United Nations and the Commission for reflection on military secrets and their effects on the environment.In the long term this also offers a starting point for reflection on the very use of this type of weapon.- (de) Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, in a few months hundreds of thousands of vacationers will go again on the Adriatic beaches to spend the summer holidays there.From the means of communication we know that bombs and weapons were thrown into the coasts in the vicinity of the coasts.Can you ensure that those who go on vacation this summer will be able to swim in the Adriatic without running dangers, and actions are expected to better study the threat we face?I would like to guarantee many things, but unfortunately I can't do it.We formulate our judgments based on relationships like this and to the verification missions that we send in cases like this.	it
Allow me to assure Mr. MacCormick, among other lords, that the current situation, in which specific consumption taxes differ between the Member States, is really little conducive to the good march of the internal market.Although this situation is not limited to alcoholic products.If we analyze gasoline, for example, we will see that special taxes in Germany are different from those in Holland and, consequently, Dutch motorists cross the border to fill their deposits in Germany.It is actually a distortion of the internal market.If it depended on me, it would stir a magical wand and match taxes on specific consumption throughout Europe.With which, smuggling would disappear, except if the products are intrinsically more expensive in a member state than in another.But I don't have any magical wand and it doesn't depend on me.It is an area in which there must be unanimity, as Mr. MacCormick knows, and unless all member states agree on the harmonization of specific consumption taxes, it will never be achieved.Once again, towards the end of this year, the Commission will submit a report on the situation of specific consumption taxes and, obviously, I will be available to discuss with the Parliament on said report.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner.Today we will pay attention to him and try to take a glass - or two, perhaps - of Alsacia wine, that we do not know what imposition he has, although I suppose he will also have high taxes.Having exhausted the time assigned to the question shift to the commission, questions 55 to 114 will be answered in writing.The commission's question shift is closed.(The session, interrupted at 19.30, resumes at 9:00 p.m.) community policy in the field of water (continued) in accordance with the agenda, the debate on the recommendation for the second reading on community policy in the field of water is continuation.Mr. President, the situation of sweet waters in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has not stopped growing and the quality of decreasing.To this we should add the problems of contamination of the waters that afflict the possible new Eastern Member States.By the way, a cyanide raft in Romania threatening aquifers that supplies the population of Yugoslavia has just been broken.I understand that Mrs. Wallström, whom I really thank her presence tonight, will visit the area.I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can fail to recognize the need for this directive to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a program of specific measures for each hydrographic basin.Gestation has been difficult and complex, multiple interests and opinions are divided.I have no doubt that the rapporteur in this legislature, Mrs. Lienemann, has dedicated great effort and dedication to reconcile and reconcile positions, and has achieved it to an important extent.	es
Luckily, I say!As is perhaps known, the Mediterranean, unlike the cold seas of the North, is a small and warm sea, where it is very difficult, if not impossible, that fish of fish of a certain species form.Consequently, in our opinion, the idea, hypothesized in the motivation of the report in question, of establishing CT in the Mare Nostrum, is in our opinion.Finally, as regards the amendments proposed by the unitary left group, we would vote in favor.In fact, we consider it very important to financially support traditional fishing and crafts, as well as the help of fishermen's income in the periods in which the so -called biological detention is applied: in essence, to make an important and responsible economic activity compatible with the necessary respect for the environment.Mr. President, first of all I please see that the Katiforis report takes into consideration the multiplicity of the factors responsible for the degradation of the marine environment: pollution, uncontrolled fishing, the presence of extractive platforms, pressure of human activity on coastal areas are sources of potential environmental damage on large scale, both in coastal and wide areas, and fishing is a further victim of this state of affairs.It is therefore right to deepen and analyze the interrelationships between fishing and the environment.The use of selective tools that reduce accessory catches and limit the fishing waste is certainly an indispensable point, as it is, by the other, the reduction of fishing pressure not only in coastal waters.The reduction of fishing capacity and fishing pressure on fish stocks does not necessarily be combined with the maintenance of an obsolete fleet and limiting the modernization.More modern boats, in addition to allowing more adequate safety and hygiene conditions, can also help reduce some impact factors.Furthermore, it is important to affirm the concept that it is not possible to classify a full segment of fishing as more environmentally friendly: in some cases it is real that artisan fishing has less impact on the environment and its resources.I am further satisfied that in the report the possibility of initiating an information campaign of fishermen and consumers on the risks deriving from the reckless exploitation of the alieutic resources, as I am satisfied with the request, made to the Commission, to propose the establishment of a European prize to be attributed to different categories of the sector and to all those who offer services and advice for responsible behavior, for the purposes of the sustainable management of the alieutic stocks and the conservation of nature in the environment, is taken into consideration in the report.Marino.Mr. President, in the quality not only of a member of the Verts/Ale group, but also of a deputy of Galicia, in this intervention I would like to formulate two short considerations.First: the production of fishing and the conservation of life and marine resources are two aspects of the same question.They are the owners and sailors of the countries with greater fishing activity the most interested in respect for their living environment, as without it they cannot guarantee the future of the economy of this type.	it
We will work for it.We will see if we can achieve a consensus.Inquiry No. 5 of (H-0785/99): Contributions: Proposal for a regulation to determine the permissible total fishing quantities for certain fish stocks for the year 2000, especially in the case of the Sarfish reports from the International Council for Sea Research, the anchovial stocks in the ICES area are currently in a critical condition.The Council of Minister for Fishing Questions and the Commission have considered the effects of the transfer of the quota for the ICES areas IX, X and the Copace area 34.1.1 from Portugal to France (overfishing of 5,000 tons per year) on the ancient fields of the ICES area VIII and about their responsibility for the current position of these fishing sectorthought?Does the Council consider it to be justifiable in view of the clearly precarious situation of these stocks, to create a permanent basis for such an overfishing and exceeding the permissible total fishing quantity that was originally set to 33,000 tons annually?What measures will the Council take and when will it take them to take into account the critical state of the anchovy stocks of the quota transmission mentioned and the principle of the relative stability of fishing activity?President!The Portuguese presidency has the greatest interest to answer this question completely, also because it is related to a problem that affects Portugal in a positive sense, and I also explain why.The Council is aware of the critical situation of the anchovy stocks in the Cantabric Sea, of which the Lord spoke.At the last council of the ministers for fishing questions on December 16 and 17 of last year, the Member States who operate this fishing, and these are France, Spain and Portugal, came to the opinion that the application of the precautionary principle, in which the permissible total catchment from 5,000 tons was screwed down to 2,000 tons, was too as a precaution.In order to reduce a balanced relationship between the need to reduce the biological risks - i.e. the impairment of the fish species - and the economic and social problems caused by a restriction of fishing, a compromise solution was found by setting the permissible total fishing amount to the average level of 16,000 t instead of the 33,000 t in 1999.Their review was also planned on the basis of new scientific information on species protection, and it is expected that the relevant information can be disposed of in the first half of this year.For the southern anchovy population, in the ICES area IX, the permissible total fishing amount for the entire year 2000 was set at 10,000 t, while it was still 13,000 t in 1999.The exchange of fishing rates between Portugal and France was proportional from 5 008 t in 1999 to 3,000 t in 2000, which can be caught in French waters.I would like to point out that this quota transfer does not increase the pressure on the anchovy stocks as a whole, for the entire space of community fishing.According to the principle of the relative stability, the distribution key for anchovies in the Cantabric Sea Spain and France only assigns 10 %.	de
For the time being, this is my opinion.It may be the subject of discussions here and elsewhere.I will listen to any suggestion but my first conclusion is that this authority should occupy a central position rather than peripheral.Dear colleagues, I find myself in a very difficult situation, because I cannot change the agenda.I would suggest that you discuss this subject within your political groups and to raise the question during the Conference of Presidents.If you believe that these sessions which follow a declaration from the Commission are important, I would suggest that we are asking for more time than the half hour dedicated to them.This time, the questions posed by the deputies lasted six minutes and the reports and the declaration of the commissioner lasted 29 minutes.As you can see, half an hour is really not enough for such sessions.I hope you discuss it in your political groups so that we can participate in better structured sessions with the commission on future occasions.The debate is closed.Question time (commission) The agenda calls the time for questions to the Commission (B5-0003/2000).I inform you that we will devote about an hour and fifteen minutes to this time.The scheduled time will therefore be slightly shortened because the performers work today in continuous session.The word is to Mr. Purvis for a procedural motion.I have an objection as to the fact that we decrease the time for the time of questions;This is one of the rare opportunities in which the common deputies has the opportunity to intervene and I ask you to extend it at an hour and a half as it is stipulated in the agenda.It's the agenda and I think we have to stick to it.Dear colleague, if we stick to the agenda, we should have started at 5.30 p.m., but you see the time it is.In any case, I hope that we will not arrive in night session.First part Question no 28 of (H-0781/99): Subject: Construction of a nuclear power plant in a region of Turkey with strong seismicity the two earthquakes, of a magnitude greater than 7 on the Richter scale, recently occurred in Turkey arouse the most lively concerns before the will displayed by Turkey to build costly nuclear reactors in Akuyu, even as the excessProduced by the Ataturk dams is exported to third countries and which the EU is leaving for its own resources to contribute to the repair of the damage caused by earthquakes.We are led to think that the Turkish nuclear program, which ignores the dangers incurred by the inhabitants and the ecosystems of the country and the whole of the region, serves as a facade for a strategy arrested by the political authorities of Turkey to acquire the nuclear technology which will allow them to acquire nuclear weapons, insofar as they seek to acquire the same reactors, whichPakistan.What actions does the Commission have to undertake to prevent any nuclear disaster and oppose the acquisition of nuclear weapons by a country that wishes to join the EU and affects considerable sums to nuclear programs, even though it absorbs community credits for financial assistance?	fr
In many respects, the treatment inflicted on the original inhabitants of the United States of America goes against the most fundamental human rights.The history of Dineh Indians is significant.With the discovery and - certainly - the exploitation of black gold and, later, uranium and oil, all means were good to chase these populations of their land and send them to regions offering few other perspectives than poverty, deprivation and pollution.The Arizona region, which must become the new Dineh Indian territory was affected, in 1979, by the largest nuclear disaster known by the United States.We therefore plan to send the last 4,000 Dineh Indians to these lands.The struggle of these Indians is supported by more than 250 NGOs and we were made aware of this situation thanks to the action of the Belgian organization for Mother Earth.It is also significant for American society which has hardly heard of it.They are very careful about wars and genocides taking place in other parts of the world but they unjustly ignore the genocide which takes place in their own country.Today, the Dineh Indians begin their last fight for their right to land, their right to dignity and, above all, their right to choose their lifestyle.However, there are only a few while their opponent is a very powerful economic fact.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I join the many remarks made by the previous speakers but I would still like to emphasize a few elements.The Dineh people are one of the Navajo Indians in North America.They have been faced with exclusion and have been fighting for survival for decades.They have lived for many years in heartbreaking conditions.The conditions of poverty in which they live forces them to give in, on the ground floor, to the financial and economic pressure exerted by the mining industry.The reimplantation law introduced in 1974, which aims to a new distribution of the Navajo reserves, authorizes the displacement of population groups.These re -implantations are naturally unacceptable because human rights are flouted, both economically and culturally.The Dineh Indians are moved like pawns and lose in the adventure not only their history and their essential land for them - the land of their ancestors - but also any prospect of work and source of income.The reimplantation law was pushed to the congress by a group representing the mining industry.Congress has never asked itself the question of where the inhabitants of the region should go and what influence would have this re -implantation on their lives.The population did not have a voice in the chapter.It looks like human trafficking.The reimplantation was carried out and the Dineh people were moved to a region polluted by uranium.After the rupture of a barrage in the New Mexico in 1979, and the release of 370,000 m3 of radioactive water and 1100 tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the most polluted regions in the world.	fr
Two questions: First, you said that you will start dialogue with citizens and I am already starting with 700 trainees with the European Commission.Do you also intend to contact citizens via the media, that is to say also via television and internet?My second question is critical.The European Commission has just submitted a proposal for transparency.If I compare it with the proposal for transparency that works in the Netherlands at the legislative level, it is just a pale reflection and has raised many criticisms in the Netherlands.My question is therefore the following: how do you mean to guide transparency with regard to the CIG because the directive we currently have is not a good example?Madam MP, Minister Maij-Weggen, since we are talking about transparency about the CIG, you know how things are going to be done.Negotiation begins at the moment.The group of representatives is in a meeting in Brussels and I will endeavor to join him earlier.The documents will be mostly open documents, working documents.We are not going to discuss in front of the media during the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between the ministers and the European Council, but I have committed myself, I cannot do something else at this stage, to practice this transparency and to account, in the most appropriate pregnant, of this negotiation and from the point of view of the Commission.I confirm to you, thanking you for questioning me on this point, that we will use all modern means, television in particular, which will be able to retransmit in this or that country, even at European level, our public debates.We will open a forum on the Internet, create permanent discussion forums.The commissioners will undertake to answer quickly to all the questions that will be asked.We will use all these modern means.But I believe that you also have to make the effort to go as close as possible to people.I would like, in all regions of Europe -no doubt it is still a little utopian -I would like a commissioner, when he can, a European parliamentarian, a minister, can go to public debates.I have proof that it is possible.Most of you make these debates in their constituencies, in their regions.From a slightly more selfish point of view of the Commission, I would like this institution, in the minds of citizens, to have a face, that men and women who constitute it can go as often as possible to meet citizens.Mr. President, I salute the commitment made by Mr. Barnier to go to the regions, in order to explain themselves and listen to what the citizens have to say.I would like to invite it in my own region, Yorkshire, which fully participates in the European single market and is an important beneficiary of European structural funds.He can go there with the two caps he carries as a commissioner.I would like to ask him with what vigor the commission intends to carry out this information campaign?	fr
One of the most important transfers -the transfer Tajo -Segura -, which has been in operation for many years, almost 30 years, has an approval for 658 HM3/year.The largest amount broadcast in one year was 453, and the transmission agent in 20 years is just over two hundred.We cannot be accused of poor management.And is the commissioner known that of these 263 HM3, a lot of 25 HM3 for irrigation purposes on the left edge of the Levant, 30 HM3 for the supply in the area of ​​the Júcar, 7 HM3 are used for care and irrigation for the supply in the southern area of ​​the Júcar and the rest in the area of ​​Segura?We also do not operate badly.We cannot be forbidden to carry out transfers if our economy and the development of our areas depend.I am not addressing the topic of quality and the available technical improvements because I think we will negotiate this guideline again.But look: In this pluralistic Europe that we are building in the community spirit, you have to search for pluralistic and non -uniform solutions.Therefore, I appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council and this parliament, and when voting, the various European countries do not uniform in such questions in which subsidiarity must be enforced.Ms. Commissioner: Andalusia is not Lapland.President, Dear MPs!First of all, let me thank the environmental committee and above all the rapporteur, Ms. Lienemann, for an ambitious and constructive work on this framework directive for water policy.Water is one of our most important natural powers, which numerous speakers have already emphasized.An ambitious and balanced European water policy is an important partial aspect for sustainable development in Europe.The water is also one of the areas that I will pay special attention during my tenure.I am delighted with the spirit of agreement that goes through the amendments brought by Parliament.Many of these applications are based on the extremely constructive, informal conversations that were led in connection with the first reading between Parliament and Council.Most of the changes proposed by the parliament contribute to an improvement and tightening of the text.The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments.A large number of amendments that Parliament brought in indicates that mediation will be essential.With regard to these upcoming negotiations, I therefore appeal to the parliament to vote for an ambitious statement.First I would like to give some of my most important arguments.We now have the opportunity to put the obligations received in connection with the OSPAR convention.Before we think of a legal liability of these objectives, we have to consider their political nature, as is also reflected in some applications for change in the parliament. As far as the water fees are concerned, this guideline will determine the water policy of Europe for the next three decades.Therefore, it is our obligation to make sure that the right incentives and the right drives for an effective fee structure and pricing, which contribute to improving our environment in an inexpensive way.	de
Finally, our resolution clearly establishes that it is indispensable, in the matter of maritime security, to get out of this infernal spiral of generalized irresponsibility, of this pernicious system of reciprocal paralysis in which the states release the ball to the union, and the union to the states, for greater benefit than pollutes.That each one plays their role in their place.That the commission, whose American tropism for once has not come into play, when it would have been beneficial, define as soon as possible a general maritime security framework.This must include minimum age and characteristics of ships to access community waters and ports;and a general principle of environmental responsibility that allows clarifying the responsibilities of the various protagonists, especially shipowners, and sanctioning them hard.That the commission occupies the coordination of information, which does not fear to face the laxism of some large ports or important shipowners, and put the question of the pavilions of convenience in the core of the negotiation with Malta and Cyprus.I remember that Erika was enrolled in La Valetta.However, it is not due, obviously, to exempt the states of their own and essential responsibility on the union: the rigor and effectiveness (and therefore the means) of the control by the state of the port condition everyone's security.We must remain and we will remain especially vigilant in the coming months to ensure that the victims, who of course do not have the slightest responsibility in this catastrophe, are compensated entirely by the pollution, and so that this time they really extract from the black tide lessons in maritime security, so that the pollutions of playing with the life of our maritime populations are definitively dissupped.The most effective prevention is to run the risk of receiving strong financial sanctions to all potential pollution.Katiforis Report (A5-0017/2000) we agree that fishing activity is one of the most interested in promoting respect for the marine environment.But it is necessary to take into account that many causes contribute to the degradation of marine spaces: pollution by oil tankers and other maritime transport, industrial activity, the pressure of human activity over coastal strips and, naturally, uncontrolled fishing activity.However, it should be noted that small -scale coastal fishing is a good illustration that it is possible to combine a fishing activity with sustainable and non -aggressive development for the marine environment.We consider that it is possible to compatible a fishing management policy based on the conservation of the marine environment with the interests of the fishing communities.But, for that, it is necessary to take into account, in particular, that there is a correlation between the performance of the fishing activity and the increase in fishing effort.Thus, it is necessary to adopt measures, in the field of common fishing policy, and assign appropriate financial resources to guarantee the income of those who live exclusively from the fishing activity, such as fishermen, particularly in times of paralysis or reduction of fishing activity.	es
"Thousands of deaths and wounded, are tens of thousands of refugees not enough to justify it?The second country, and I will be very brief about it, because Mr. Patten knows it very well, it is Burma.It is not tolerable that we were silent about Burma.I have the impression that this country slowly falls into oblivion.It has been ten years since an elected president has been assigned to be under house arrest.Parliament has not been working for ten years.Many deputies have been murdered or fled and only a small number still resident in Burma.Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Burma are found in Thailand and India, and yet it looks like we no longer pay attention to this country.I find that following the upheavals in Indonesia, Burma should be given to the agenda, too.It is still not acceptable that Ms. Aung San Su Kyi feels completely abandoned, especially by Europe.My request is that this country is also put back at the forefront of our priorities.Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman in office of the Council, Mr. Commissioner, the economic power of the European Union cannot constitute the only decisive element of his affirmation in the world.What distinguishes us is the systematic reference to human rights, both with us and in those with whom we have relationships.The European Parliament has been at the center of the promotion and defense of human rights, which seek to go beyond the limits of selfishness and ""national interests"" which sometimes result in the positions of the Member States and even other institutions of the European Union.This is why we can say, for example, that the European Parliament has never forgotten the situation in East Timor, which could have been the worst enemy of a just solution for its people, which has always opposed the Indonesian occupation.This is why we still recently opposed the sale of weapons to Indonesia, a position whose council unfortunately did not take into account.But it is not enough to avoid or put an end to revolting situations by people or institutions, against the weakest.The authors of offenses must not remain unpunished, whoever it is, wherever they are, in Indonesia, in Angola, in Cuba, in China or in Burma, whether it is a civil or a soldier, a soldier, a general or a minister.Justice must be done in Indonesia.Justice must be done in East Timor.President Wahid needs our support to deal with the difficult situation he inherited.It was at the initiative of the PPE that Parliament included at the time an express reference in East Timor in this resolution.There are officials for what happened in this country, of which I was partly the witness as a representative of the Parliament, and they cannot remain unpunished."	fr
However, I think that we should do everything to limit the transport of dangerous goods as much as possible, and this in all countries, whether they are regions of transit or not.Mr. President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr. Koch, of his magnificent work and his positive collaboration with the Commission to improve texts, present this report and this proposal;In the end, only an amendment was presented, which relates to the requirements applicable to the aptitude examination of security advisers for road transport, by rail or by the navigable of dangerous goods.We believe that collaboration, common work on the part of the two Parliament and Commission institutions is important and that the cooperation that exists with the regional policy commission, and concretely with the transport group, is magnificent.The common position includes practically all the amendments accepted by the Commission, harmonizes the minimum requirements applicable to the examinations of security advisers and, second reading, we can accept the proposed date, much more realistic than that projected at the start by the Commission, knowing that this has already been debating this question for several years.Very briefly, I would also like to thank the various deputies for their interventions and say that security is a priority of the commission in the field of transport.As Mr. Simpson said, it should never be considered that the process is acquired, that it has resulted.The process of increasing margins, safety guarantees in transport is a process that should be improved day after day.In this sense, I would also like to tackle the problems of the tunnels very briefly, to which MM.Rack and Swoboda have referred, and which, in the case of Austria, undoubtedly constitute a very sensitive subject, which is why it is necessary to make efforts to see how to increase their security.During one of the major accidents that occurred lately, the goods transported was not dangerous in itself.Margarine and a few pounds of painting which did not present any risks, caused a real disaster.It is therefore necessary to study the way in which the requirements can be adjusted even more in order to guarantee maximum security.Finally, I would like to say that it is necessary to approach the safety of all types of transport.This week, we will organize a debate here to talk about the security of maritime transport, following the Erika disaster, and we will have to discuss objectives throughout this year in terms of security, air transport.But I want to say, ladies and gentlemen, that security is a priority objective of the Commission.As I will say during the debate on Erika, we do not expect that a disaster occurs to devote body and soul to the aspect of security, but we work on it on the sidelines of these circumstances, which only highlight the urgency of an effective response to this type of problem.	fr
The Commission must have the opportunity to refuse new assignments if you are no more personal.The staff system is too rigid: it is necessary to ensure greater rotation of officials, especially at the top of the hierarchy.It must also be much easier to fire inefficient and incompetent officials.I am therefore very satisfied that a reform of the disciplinary procedure is introduced.The bad experiences gained so far in the matter of disciplinary issues show all too well how much a reform is necessary.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, in the first place I cannot help but think that this is basically an Anglo-Nerando-Scandinavo debate, judging by the speakers.I find it a little worrying.I hope, like many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is about to be exhausted.We have to get out of this logic, in which we do not even have time to turn off a fire that we must immediately fall to extinguish another burst elsewhere.As Mr Blak says, we must instead establish a system in which the roles are clear.First of all, a rigorous regulation is needed, and it is necessary to apply it.Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough.Severe rules are needed that establish, among other things, what can be decentralized, what can be transferred outside and what should be independent.I find it disturbing that in this discussion it is triggered to independence without specifying in relation to what, and with what decision -making rights.In short, it is necessary to have a basic administrative regulation for the union, for its institutions and for relations with the Member States.Here is what is missing.We asked for a European public prosecutor and a criminal law, but union also needs its own administrative law.It would certainly be a step forward if the Commission welcomed the proposal, advanced by the mediator, of a code of conduct for good administration having binding value.The Van Hulten relationship represents a step in the right direction, but that's not enough.Secondly, we must also clearly define our skills regarding the review of the accounts.The Court of Auditors has the task of ascertaining compliance or not of the rules, but must not enter into the merits of the opportunity of a given act.Political assessments are a prerogative of Parliament, which must not instead go hunting thieves because it is a Holaf task.Tell me which national parliament receives, for example, all the reports of the preliminary investigations!At the cost of making me stubborn, I want to add that the regulation on the advertising of the documents must be much better than the draft in circulation on the internet, because otherwise we will not reach anything in our battle.Mr. President, I would like to thank the speaker for his work.I am pleased to be able to turn to him in Dutch, as the Honorable Van Den Berg also did.Otherwise I would perhaps have felt a little guilty.This relationship shows a significant improvement, also thanks to the amendments.I am part of the commission for employment and social affairs and within us a speaker is always proud to receive 100 amendments, because in this way he is aware of having raised an interesting topic.	it
Report Böge (A5-0023/2000) as a member of the European Member and above all as a citizen and consumer, I welcome the European Commission's proposal, which represents a further step towards better nutritional security within the European Union.This proposal has two sides.On the one hand, it is about changing the 1991 guideline's directive with regard to the health police requirements by abolishing the provisions regarding the daring disease in sheep;On the other hand, a new regulation is intended to enter into force with which the regulations for contraception and combating certain transmissible spongegormarmorer encephalopathies (TSE) or diseases of the type BSE that affect sheep and other animal species are determined.The meaning of these new regulations is that in this way one creates a special legal basis for combating the travure disease in sheep.With this result, I am all the more satisfied than it was one of our most important demands that we had formulated in our BSE followers.In my opinion, it is essential that for reasons of coherence, we are incorporated into a single comprehensive system of new regulations for the TSE, which are limited to trading in trade with sheep and goats, which relate to all animals throughout the European Union and should guarantee protection against contaminated foods and animal feed.This regulation is all the more to be welcomed than there are still ambiguities with regard to the daring disease in sheep.Some scientific hypotheses assume that the trotting disease could be a pre-stage of BSE in cattle and thus the origin of the BSE disease.Even if the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council for contraception and combating certain TSE must still be specified and expanded - in particular with regard to the recording and combating of the trotting disease - it represents a considerable improvement. This is a subfolite for European citizens who have often expressed their concern in view of European politics in the food sector.Her concerns that our European Parliament took up were heard.The European Commission caused the debates on the precautionary principle as well as questions of traceability, responsibility and transparency to publish a white book on food safety.This white book shows several considerations, and above all it suggests the creation of an independent European food authority.All of this is part of a European strategy to regain the trust of consumers.Now, the European managers, we have to prove that the internal market and free transport of goods must be reconciled with food safety!Report Cederschiöld (A5-0008/2000) Mr. President, I voted for this recommendation for the redesign of copyright protection law because I consider this to be one of the most important areas of the activities of the European Parliament.In my opinion, the product of intellectual work is much more important than the finished constructions, the objective products that we can see and touch without any doubt, while spirit and science produce results that cannot be touched by hand, which are, however, invaluable.As a European community, we should therefore support them far more powerful, not only by the way of patent protection, but also by promoting and supporting the scientists, those who, using their knowledge, do everything for future generations to offer much more than we used to have.In principle, we are against the fact that the European Community concludes contracts for copyrights on behalf of the Member States.	de
"Coherence, uniformity and universal good quality standards in a decentralized financial control system are guaranteed by a range of measures.One of them is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no general management can take charge of the financial control only for condition and as long as the audit service is absolutely convinced of the robustness of this system.Another measure is the establishment of a central financial service, as will note the honorable parliamentarians when reading the white paper, in order to ensure that these standards are set up and supervised.And there is also the theoretical and practical approach relating to an effective and independent internal audit service.In a parliamentary response of this type, I will not enter into all the details, but I am sure that on the exam, Ms. Theato will be able to see that the details of the White Paper give us strong guarantees.It will also be demonstrated that we have taken into account representations in this assembly, and especially within the budget control commission, which is significant with regard to the use of ex ante visas in general departments.The ex ante system can be used if we consider, in a general management, that this is an important and effective means of improving financial control.Naturally, there are several requirements within the Commission which depend on the number and nature of the financial transactions carried out by each general management.The white paper takes into account this too but when you want or when it is obviously necessary to use such a system, it must certainly be used.Last point, the transition.I share Ms. Theato's reservations on the said ""Sweet Legal Standard"".We have already had this discussion and she knows that I distinguish between different forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and which can ultimately be transformed into what we could call ""severe legal standard"".But, in this case, there is no place in my opinion for the ""gentle legal standard"", and that is why, in the transition period, there will be total adhesion to the current financial regulations until this law is changed by a democratic process in good and due form, within this assembly and the Council.The white paper guarantees this completely and it contains arrangements to do this.In addition, however, and this is very important because it is a transition period, there will be training, advice, support, guarantees and the new audit unit head will fully enter on May 1.With all this and a number of other guarantees, I think we can also be convinced that it is possible to be that the system will be completely safe even during the transition period.I have to make two other remarks because this is an essential question, at the CUR of the reform.My first remark is that citizens think - for reasons that I understand very well - that this transition has risks either irresponsibility or inertia."	fr
This shows who is willing to vote for the legally dubious retroactive character of the measure that would be expensive for future car buyers and would be a devastating blow to the European automotive industry.President, values, colleagues!I would like to briefly address the economic consequences of this guideline again and express my support for the amendments brought by my colleague Bernd Lange, since they have the advantage - and I would particularly like to underline this point - to reconcile environmental requirements and economic necessities.The common point of view of the council said that the vehicle manufacturers have to cover the costs for the withdrawal and recycling for the whole.However, as Mr. Lange explained so aptly, this solution would strongly disadvantage European manufacturers.I come from a country where cars are built and can tell them that it would be impossible to retrospectively impose the entire financial responsibility for all vehicles of their brand, which are currently still in operation, i.h.the coverage of the costs for 80 % of the European vehicle stock.This solution is unacceptable, because these manufacturers did not have the option of involving the environmental requirements that we today prescribe to them in their manufacturing processes and their cost.Due to the common point of view, the European vehicle manufacturers get into an unfavorable situation compared to the manufacturers who have been pregnant to the European market.Of course, it is not our job to defend this or that national interest to defend this or that industrial lobby, but rather our task is to defend the competitiveness of Europe on the world market and jobs in the sectors in which we are really competitive.Therefore, I ask you to support the values ​​that are supported by Bernd Lange Lange, which are also supported by the faction of the European Social Democrats, since they actually bring about all concerns - the economic interests and environmental requirements - to the Member States in which they want to implement these requirements, because these change applications already provide for the existing systems- some of which work quite well - can be maintained.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, the proposal of a guideline about old vehicles with whom we deal with today is directed to secure a high level of environmental protection in the Union and, on the other hand, to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market.I would like to briefly mention that historical vehicles and classic cars naturally have to be removed from the scope of the directive, because I think we all agree that they belong to our cultural heritage.However, there are u. A.For Article 12, d.h.to the date from which the guideline applies.The solution proposed by the parliament, i.e.h.18 months after the entry into force of the guideline for first -time vehicles, is hardly realistic.The European vehicle stock includes dozens of millions of cars that have to be withdrawn without the recycling requirements being taken into account in their design.The common point of view would be more practical because it provides for the already approved vehicles in 2006.	de
I find that the official council president is willing to answer everything, but I have to wake up that inquiries are made in this session and answers.Mr. Rübig has the word.President, fourteen Member States, have imposed bilateral sanctions against a Member State because a democratically elected government was formed there.Both parties have already been involved in the government.To date, there are no violations of the law.Are preventive sanctions compatible with the human rights chart?Would a veto law of the council chairman in the event of national government formation with the fundamental rights chart?Is the call to violent demonstrations compatible with the Fundamental Charter?Mr. MP!As an incumbent Council President, I cannot give you an answer, for the simple reason, because the Portuguese Prime Minister's opinion on the name of fourteen heads of state and government of the Member States of the European Union at a bilateral level and not as President of the European Union.However, I would like to say that the complex of preventive measures that these Member States of the European Union have carried out at a strict bilateral level includes steps that, I would say, have a politically preventive character on a diplomatic level.We consider them to be fully justified and believe that they are accommodating what would be appropriate compared to the occurrence of a party and representatives of a party, which - so - as a party involved in a government of the European Union, does not give us any guarantees that they can fulfill the goals of the Union.I do not want to go into this topic on behalf of the President of the European Union, because this is about an intervention by my government, which has taken place at the request of fourteen Member States and in cooperation with them and not as a chair of the European Union.Mr President, I have the honor of belonging to the group that draws on the charta, and I will therefore not ask for the council to make conjectures about the content of the charter or to provide information about whether the charter should receive a programmatic character or legal binding.I would like to know what happens to the draft of the Charter that the working group creates.Will the Council see this draft as a document that it has to accept in the present form or reserves the right to change this document at will?Will the Council of this document simply approve or reject, or will it have the right to revert the draft of the charter?The answer is neither yes nor.I don't know, Mr Member, that will depend on the decision that is made at the council level.Inquiry No. 8 of (H-0042/00): concerns: The granting of export loan and their role in connection with the construction of the Ilisu dam in Turkey at the G8 meeting in Cologne was asked to prepare the determination of common standards for the granting of export loans.These loans can be used in such a way that they distort the competition or that questionable projects are supported.Will the EU be predicted in a leading role in determining common standards?The British government's explanation recently showed that this would be necessary that it intended to grant an export loan involved in the construction of the Ilisu dam in Turkey.	de
"I therefore believe, as the amendment n.10, that today's discussion should lead us to ask for a rapid suspension of this penalty policy.Mr President, honorable colleagues, we did not have to wait for the end of the conflict in Kosovo to understand that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia with their negative consequences for the stability of the Balkan area, a global and durable strategy would have been necessary for the whole region in order to guarantee peace and stability in South Eastern Europe.This strategy, outlined in the stability pact approved on June 10, 1999 in Cologne, considers the region of the southeast European in its entirety, while recognizing the differences and disparities of development of the various countries that are part of it.The contribution of the European Union in the context of the stability pact, the so -called ""process of stabilization and association"", represents the development of the regional conception developed by the European Community in 1996 for the five countries of the region - Bosnia -Herzegovina, Croatia, Yugoslav Federal Republic, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania - whose most significant aspect was to establish political and economic conditions aimed at promoting implementation.of the peace agreement of Dayton, which should thus contribute to the stability of the region.An important contribution to the stability of the Balkans consists in establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on completely new bases, in the perspective of a complete integration of this country within the European Union through the mechanism provided for by the stabilization and association process.The necessary prerequisite is that the countries concerned are willing to accept a certain number of conditions.We believe that a strong political signal should be sent to these countries, telling them that one day they can be of ours, in evidently respecting their sovereignty.Without getting illusions, the mandate that we entrust to the Commission today can constitute, once the agreement is reached, the first decisive step towards peace and stability in such a tormented region, whose peoples have already shown that they can legitimately be part of our space of freedom and development.Other suffering cannot be added to those suffered under the Soviet yoke and at the price they had to pay later, having been forced to be part of the communist block.As far as we know, from a political and economic point of view, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is now able to establish new contractual relations with the European Union, also going beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 June 1998 which aims, in practice, to compliance with community purchase, especially in key areas of the internal market.The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will certainly have to make great efforts still but, if we consider the political and economic reforms already introduced as part of the cooperation agreement as well as the adoption of transitory periods in certain sectors, this country will satisfy the conditions for a stabilization and association agreement.By sharing the thesis according to which the development of the Region also constitutes a factor of internal stability, confirming the negotiating mandate in the terms in which it has been proposed to us and underlining that it is a bilateral agreement with the European Union, we agree with the speaker when he observes that this is the first concrete application of an integrated and long -term strategy for sweat -east Europe and that the main question is to know how the Balkans will be structured in the future in order to ensure the aim in order.peace and stability."	it
All these elements must be applied cumulatively.It is also important to keep in mind that there is a wide range of measures that can be adopted in the resource to the precautionary principle.For example, a research program, dissemination campaigns, recommendations, and so on.The appeal to the principle of caution, therefore, does not automatically imply a prohibition.This communication does not intend to be the last word on this matter;However, it is the first time that the Commission makes a structured presentation of the principle and its operational application.When exposing how the commission applies and it is proposed to apply the precautionary principle, we hope to clarify the situation at the community level and contribute to the debate that is being developed at European and international level.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, thank you very much for the explanation.I have to ask three short questions.The first: we have had to wait a long time for an opinion of the commission about the precautionary principle and in the past it was not clear if the commission spoke with one voice.Is this what you also presented here also the opinion of your colleague the Industry Commissioner, his colleague the Commissioner of Foreign Trade, of his colleague the commissioner for the competition and of his colleague the commissioner for the internal market?You are going to tell me without a doubt that yes, but I want to know from you if these gentlemen also know what consequences it has.The next question, Mrs. Wallström: When will you begin to apply this in the legislation, for example, in the laws on chemicals or in other fields?The last question: are we going to be able to recognize where this has been applied in the laws?That is, will there be an extra document in each proposal that says that the precautionary principle has been examined and that this result has been reached?.(En) Thank you very much, Mrs. Roth-Behrendt, for these questions.Naturally, the entire commission shares it.It is a common communication that we have written three of us, Messrs. Byrne, Liikanen and me, but that has been approved unanimously in the Commission.He has received the firm support of the other commissioners and has been submitted to consultation in the different services of the Commission.Therefore, we have worked thoroughly in this document and I am sure that all commissioners know the guidelines and principles included in this document.Yes, I would like to say that we already use this working method in the case of several difficult issues such as a new strategy regarding chemicals, for example.And I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle.Recently we have had a case in which it has been used at the beginning of caution when the use of phthalates had to be prohibited in the manufacture of PVC soft toys, and we naturally apply it in different environmental areas.Mainly, this principle has been used in the environment of the environment and also, naturally, in other fields related to public health.	es
The other principle of the common point of view of the council in the draft guideline has a retroactive character.However, it contradicts all generally recognized economic and legal principles to retrospectively impose a financial responsibility for its product.He would also change the responsibility for the owner retrospectively, because a consumer may have changed the product in various ways over the years.In all Member States of the EU there are currently laws that regulate the scrapping of cars.These are either better or worse from country to country.In the expectation of the implementation of this EU directive, however, every state in the Union should regulate the disposal of old vehicles as best as possible, so that the EU regulations do not receive any retrospective validity.This does not conflict with a financing model through fund formation.Mr. President, the importance of the present guideline for the environment and the economy is obvious and is generally recognized.The common point of view represents a compromise that is quite difficult and quite difficult and on shaky feet, so that, as not to endanger the entire directive, there are only very limited scope for improvements.I therefore claim that the parliament must not force anything, and it would be paradoxical if this would do so in the sense of reducing the environmental scope of the directive.I remind you that the vehicle manufacturers have granted to be able to live with the guideline;The costs are not excessively high: the disposal of a car costs less than 1 % of the purchase price of a new vehicle.In addition, the financial responsibility of the manufacturers only comes into force in 2006, so a large part of the currently present vehicles will no longer be on the market;For the remaining vehicles, a form of the cost allocation could be provided, as proposed in the changes in the Lange, which I have brought in Lange, which in my opinion are the only one with the balance of the common point of view and with experience in some countries and must therefore be supported.President, that is an extremely bad guideline.First of all, as my colleague Mr. Bowis found, she has a retroactive character, and that is basically wrong.Secondly, she has huge costs for the European automotive industry, which would have a negative impact on competitiveness and labor market.We are constantly talking about the European labor market in this parliament, and yet we constantly say goodbye to measures that make the number of jobs drop.In my opinion, the guideline is also bad in other ways, which has not yet been sufficiently discussed in this debate.It is like many European regulations.It is far too normative.She bindingly prescribes a specific model of recycling.The assembly line was invented by Henry Ford about a hundred years ago, and we practically suggest the establishment of a assembly line as in the 19th century, only that it runs backwards and dismantled vehicles and the individual assemblies are dismantled for recycling.However, we should stop briefly and think that the sales opportunities of recycled bumpers are extremely uncertain.The plastics industry does not want to get these products back and cannot afford to take back economically at all.There is already a very successful industry that browsing cars, reclining metals and generating energy by burning the non -metal parts.	de
"Regarding the former, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and in an action plan, which aspire to apply the following decision taken by the heads of government to tampered: ""guarantee the fair treatment of third countries of third countries who stay legally in the territory of the Member States. A more incisive integration policy should aim to guarantee them rights and obligations similar to those of the citizens of the Union"".Exactly the opposite, Mr. President, of what we have seen and discovered in these days in El Ejido: a world of irregularities, exploitation and indecent life conditions, which had already been reported.I hope in a prompt adoption of the measures for integration and I also hope that the governments that Tampere wrote such beautiful words - including the Spanish government - commit themselves to the bottom to apply them.Minor hopes I have in the development of an effective and right European policy, consistent with the declarations of the Council on immigration.The only advanced proposal is the directive on the reunification of families - a key theme, given that in these days the means of communication have shown us many men alone in El Ejido -, but we do not know if it has already been accepted by governments.Outside the community area, some governments are used to renew their immigration policy.This is what happens also in my country, but in spite of the government;In fact, the majority party is the only one who does not like the new immigration law.The goal of combating racism and xenophobia, explicitly declared by the treaties, should also be the objective of all the institutions and all the political managers of the Union.European political parties signed the political parties of Europe in Europe for a non -racist company on 28 February 1998.The popular party also did so.This obliges him to a coherent behavior, but the local managers of this party are paying petrol on the fire, boycott the core attempts by other institutions.The party to which the mayor of El Ejido belongs should act decisively and unequivocally, in accordance with the commitments signed in that declaration.Only with great unity, as the Honorable Hernández Spring said, with responsibility and with firmness El Ejido will be able to overcome, together with Spain and Europe, those episodes that today cause us profound shame.Mr. President, you can only feel disgust and indignation in front of the lynching scenes against the Moroccan daily daily that occurred in El Ejido.We do not know what the part of responsibility attributable to the racists of the far right, nor the one attributable to ordinary people who has been so unconscious as to associate with these groups is not the part of responsibility.We want to reiterate our full solidarity with Moroccan workers who are not only exploited by unscrupulous employers, but are also found to suffer attacks of this kind.If among the attackers there are people from the poorest layers of the population, we can only tell them that they are digging the pit with their own hands."	it
And finally, and I end with this, the requirement is relative to the future powers of the European Parliament in the matters that occupy us, the policy of competition and state aid, in the perspective of the intergovernmental conference.Our report, as you know, Mr. Commissioner, defends the idea that the codecision procedure is in force for the base legislation on state aid..(De) Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Lords, my participation in this debate has as its subject the code of aid to the siderurgy, that is, the public aid granted in Europe in accordance with said code and controlled by the Commission.In 1998, a total of 27 cases were examined, on which the commission has prepared its own report.The CECA treaty will expire very soon.Therefore, the issue that today should worry is above all of the future application of the aid to the Serurgy The European Parliament hosts with satisfaction the decisions presented by the Commission in its report, including that relative to the return of an aid received in a specific case, in application of article 88 of the CECA Treaty.The most recent communication of the Commission, which has not yet been discussed in Parliament, also refers to the issue of the competitiveness of the European steel industry.The general prohibition of public aid established in section 1 of article 87 of the CE Treaty also applies to the ferrosist industry, as well as to the other sectors.In accordance with this article, state aids are incompatible in principle with the common market. Exceptions are only admitted in exactly defined cases.In accordance with article 88, the Commission has the obligation to control state aid.In 1998, the most important case was the contribution of its own capital for an amount of 540 million euros to the PREUSSAG company in Germany.Member States must also communicate to the commission the aid that are proposed to grant.The standards applicable in the Siderúrgic Industry sector were established on December 18, 1996. In accordance with them, only aid in favor of the steel industry can only be granted in certain exactly defined cases.This is: research and development aid, environmental protection aids, social aid to promote the closure of steel facilities and aid for the definitive abandonment of the activity in the case of non -competitive companies.In addition, there is an exception for Greece, with a maximum limit of 50 million euros.In recent years, there have been, however, obvious problems in the practical application of the Serurgy Aid Code that are not exposed in all its details in the report.From the point of view of Parliament, it is important that you begin to discuss a consecutive regulation for the moment when the current code of aid for the siderurgy expires.The fundamental lines of said code should not be softened.No one wants to open the doors to uncontrolled competition based on subsidies in Europe.This would seriously affect the operation of the internal market, even after the consolidation of the steel industry in recent years.The Parliament considers it necessary, therefore, that the code of aid for the aid is modified as regards the inequality of treatment denounced by the industry and that the commission present to the Council a consecutive regulation.	es
Unfortunately, I miss the indication of the associated standards.I wonder where they took these standards and values ​​from.In my opinion, the Bible, the Word of God, is the only pure source of demanding standards and real values.This knowledge, which has grown in the tradition of our continent, is a crucial element that deserves due recognition.Ms. President, Mr Commission President, ladies and gentlemen!I don't know what to stick to - to the strategic goals 2000 to 2005 or to your speech 2000 to 2010?Have you already included your second term?But seriously.The expanding union needs strengthening through slimming and limitation.First, slimming.What you say in your program for concentration on the core tasks of the Commission can only be a very first beginning.The activities of the entire Union must be attributed to the core areas of politics.These are the social and ecological orientation of the market, the securing of the currency, the guarantee of civil rights internally and the representation of the common interests to the outside world.It is not only important to speak to one voice in the world, but it depends much more about what we want to say with this voice.Second, the new buzzword is called flexibility.But out of increasing flexibility, or threatens to become intergovernmentalization very quickly.We have to stick to the clinging of the Member States through joint decision -making organs.Incidentally, this also applies to the inclusion of civil society, which is welcome.However, the citizens do not need new organs or institutions and certainly no new mixing of responsibilities.(Applause) Transparency is no longer access to more paper, but transparency for citizens is finally more clarity about who, when, what with what justification in Brussels and Strasbourg.This is transparency!Third, the European Union cannot and must not expand without limitations.Their limits do not arise from the question of how many states want, but how many they can cope with.(Applause) If the price for the expansion were the softening or even the resolution of the existing Union, it should not be paid.It would be too high, by the way, not only for the Member States that are in it, but also for the states that want to be included in this Union.A Union only as a geostrategic concept has no future, just as little as a Union that is only a mere free trade zone.However, the Union remains more than a market and only receives its legitimation from the peoples of Europe if it sees itself as a community of fate.This is much more than just her new economic and socio -political agenda or a new and better quality of life.Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament, but also the peoples and states in our European Union, will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and act together.It is no less than about reinventing the European Union without destroying the existing one!(Applause) Mrs. President!According to the Group of Liberal and Democratic Party in Europe, the most important task of the Commission and the entire Union is in a successful implementation of the expansion.	de
"At the same time, financial support via the flagship program can also be essential.However, EU's policy in the Balkans is today fragmentary, inorganized and contradictory.There are different types of agreements or relationships - or lack of relationships - which lead to the embargo in Yugoslavia and which create a fragmented and ineffective approach.It lacks the notion of regionalization for the Balkans, who understands everyone without exclusions and without a spirit of revenge.Finally, it is necessary and it is useful that the European Union intervenes for the resolution of the problem of the name of the ARYM, which, unfortunately, extends and can lead to more lively tensions.Likewise it is necessary and it is useful that it intervenes for a more active management and limited in time with regard to the negotiations of the ARYM authorities..The will expressed by the Commission to strengthen relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and to open up to the latter the prospect of full integration into the community, seems to us to respond to a priority concern: the construction of a political whole respectful of nations and their sovereignty could not postpone the sending of a sign to these states of southern EuropeEnd of the Second World War, did not spare.After being crushed by the triumphant communism boot, the region has not ended, since the early 1990s, to pay the addition of the collapse of the Soviet system.However, in this difficult context, and more particularly since the NATO military intervention in the Balkans, some of these states, all authentically European, have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which makes their aspirations in integration into the community legitimate.As such, the case of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both exemplary and emblematic.Exemplary, because it proves that the states of the Balkans are not struck by any fatality and that they are, for those who have the will, today able to meet the usual requirements of the stabilization and association agreements required by the European Union.Emblematic, because it positively illustrates the fifteen project to see a common policy in the five countries of the region (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, ARYM and ALBANIE) which would make economic and political stabilization an ardent and urgent obligation.The Uen group is all the more agreement with the sending of this signal to the old Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as it gives its place to independence and sovereignty of the States: if one cannot identify a satisfactory solution in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states that compose them, it could not be questioned thattried unworthy of such a promotion.The Union is in its role when it seeks by its cooperation policy to encourage nations to marry with it a base of common values ​​whose democracy and freedom of citizens are the cornerstone.It leaves it when it replaces the peoples in its choices, or that failing this, it reinvents a new form of ""sense of history"" which does not understand the notion of self -determination of peoples than in one way."	fr
The majority of MPs in this parliament do not want this situation, but we have to be careful when choosing our means so that we do not achieve the opposite of what we want to achieve.Ms. President, dear colleagues!I reject all explanations, statements or feelings of xenophobia or racism.I defend the good of human rights and the rule of law that Europe has.But that is precisely why I do not agree to the nonsensical actions that were initiated by the presidency (unfortunately the Portuguese presidency) in a real institutional false handle on behalf of the other fourteen countries.This is not the way to combat extremism.It can even be a way where he is still shown to be very welcome.The flood of confused and rushed measures that you have started against Austria messes up everything without meaning and mind, leads to great uncertainty among the honest citizens and harbors dangers that have not been taken into account.There is an insurmountable contradiction between positions that have been represented in the name of the preservation of human rights and the rule of law, which at the same time violate the fundamental rights of the Austrians and the decisive rules of the rule of law, in this case the norms of the contracts.What ultimately want to achieve when we make our way to a government conference?A Europe of 27 or a Europe of 14 or an even smaller Europe?For Europe, for a Europe, all the steps that led us here are honored, for a Europe that pays attention to the contracts and the right, for a Europe in which Austria is needed.That must be said!Ms. President, I am happy and proud that this parliament, with an overwhelming majority, condemned the formation of a coalition government in Austria, including Mr. Haider.In the past few years, Mr. Haider has proven that he deserves exclusion from normal democratic discourse.He not only admired Adolf Hitler, who praised Waffen-SS and refused to condemn a terrorist bomb attack, in which four Roma died, he is also a member of the regional government of Carinthia.He spoke in favor of the abolition of measures in favor of the Slovenian minority in Austria and to support immigrants.Some said we didn't have the right to interfere in Austria's politics.You are wrong.The European contracts oblige us to protect fundamental rights.Some said that we have to accept the results of democratic elections.But democratic elections are far from turning democrats out of those who threaten democracy.The tragedy of the Holocaust, which cost six million Jews, resulted in the same argument against Germany in the 1930s.But we shouldn't judge Mr. Haider for his ambition.He won't change on this point.The real culprits are Austria's Christian Democrats who have become Judas and have had a threat to Europe resurrected, which we believed that it had perished in Berlin in 1945.	de
- (de) Mr. President, I would like to precede my extra question from the Tibetan greeting who wishes happiness and peace.In Tibet, only human rights and the environment are not at stake, but also a unique cultural heritage that can also transmit important values ​​to us Europeans, including calm, slowness and empathy, compassion as Dalai Lama calls it.The question that arises is what the commission can do to support its holiness the Dalai Lama and its proposal for a peaceful solution of the Tibet issue.I point out that not acting means to decree the death of Tibetan culture and the end of the Tibetan people.I have a lot of sympathy for what the honorable parliamentary on cultural heritage and the Buddhist tradition said.Also me, like the honorable parliamentary, I read the Autobiography of Dalai Lama, an extremely moving story, not only of his responsibilities in Tibet and towards Tibet, but also of his spiritual beliefs.The Commission, like others, urged a dialogue.The Dalai Lama clarified that what he wants is a peaceful dialogue.I would have liked the reaction of the Chinese authorities to the opening of the Dalai Lama was coherent and positive.On the occasion of the visit of President Clinton to China, or in any case to the incarno in that period, the President of the People's Republic of China had given the impression that the dialogue was registered on the agenda.This would be profitable not only for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but would also be strongly in favor of the government of the People's Republic of China if this responded to attempts to open the dialogue.Question n.31, of the honorable (H-0795/99): subject: rejection by the commission of the Code of good administrative conduct in the European Union according to news reported by the press, the Commission has rejected the proposal of the European mediator, Mr. Jacob Söderman, to grant citizens the right to good administrative conduct in the European Union.The commission itself approved the idea of ​​a code of good administrative conduct, but did not accept the relative specific proposal, limiting itself to providing a series of complementary indications for a better service.The Commission can let us know if these news correspond to the truth, what is the reason for this conduct and as the difference so arose between the statements and the facts on the reform of the Community administration explains;If you believe that the incident is compatible with the program in five points decided between the European Parliament and the Commission, in September, and if it is able to present a detailed proposal of code of good administrative conduct in which Parliament can also take a position?In the name of the Commission, Commissioner Patten has the rights.The news reported by the press to which the honorable parliamentary refers seem misleading and inaccurate.In November 1999 the Commission approved a code of good administrative conduct in first reading to be included in its internal regulation.Currently the Commission is carrying out the consultations of the staff representatives on this document, a process that should end in the coming weeks and at the end of which the Commission will approve the second reading code.	it
Mr Pietrasanta illustrated the reasons why we support some aspects of the Commission's proposal, in particular those relating to the development of a vaccine and the introduction of compensation for breeders who are forced to bring down their fish.However, we are not happy with the prospect of changing the demolition policy.It has been said that Norway has done a better job than ours in controlling the salmon infectious anemia epidemic and that the proposed changes will align us more to the Norwegian approach;It must be said, however, that there is more than some differences between Norwegian and Community politics, which will also be applied in Ireland, my country of origin, in the unfortunate event that similar cases should occur.There are other differences between the two policies regarding the inspections on the disease, the periods of inactivity, the restrictions of movement of the fish and contaminated materials, and so on.Before falling to copy the Norwegian demolition policy, we must try these methods to see if it is possible to reduce the extent of the disaster.In the past there has been talk of ESB, and for many years the Greens asked to face the problem related to this disease.If you had done it, they could have saved many breeders and he would have spared a lot of money on a community level.The problem also concerns the protection of the environment, breeders and public health.I would like to thank the honorable Hudghton for the excellent report on the infectious anemia of salmon and for having supported the measures proposed by the Commission;I also thank all the speakers for intervening the debate on the subject.The Commission's proposal is aimed at ensuring a more pragmatic approach towards the control of a disease that has the potential to cause large losses to salmon farms.This approach, however, will not have to affect in any way on our goal of reducing and, if possible, eliminating the disease and cannot be adopted if the proposal contains a threat to public health.In addition, it is necessary to seriously consider the environmental implications.Experts say that the infectious anemia of salmon is considered a non -pathogenic disease for men and mammals.From the moment of his appearance, in 1984, no case of infection in humans or mammals has been ascertained.The virus affects cold -blooded animals and does not reproduce at a temperature of over 25th centigrade.Although it was present in fish intended for human consumption, it would be made inactive once ingested.In any case, infected fish cannot be intended for food use and, as an additional precaution, I confirm this concept to the scientific committee.During the debate, several important issues were raised in relation to our disease control strategy, including that of compensation.I regret a lot of the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry.As you know, starting from January 15, 2000, the Member States can promote the eradication of the disease in aquaculture with the help of a new financial instrument aimed at providing information on fishing.The commission services are developing some implementing rules that will allow the practical application of this tool.The decision of the Council 90/424 constitutes another Community financial support tool in the event of the onset of diseases.	it
It is an irrefutable fact that in the European elections the turnout at the polls has been low.To improve it, we can give ourselves to us immediately and fight crime in Europe with a European level approach.- (de) Mr. President, I too want to thank the rapporteur.The Theato report can contribute to recreating trust in European institutions, and I believe that we all recognize its urgency, if we think of the results and the low turnout in the last European elections.Every year the same problem reappears: the Court of Auditors in its report denounces various fraud committed by the Member States, but for now the European institutions have too few tools to act and ensure that it reacts concretely to remedy this state of affairs.So every year this procedure involves a loss of trust.In my opinion, the report and proposal of the honorable Theato could contribute to a turnaround, making us understand that European institutions veil so that European financial resources are used carefully and without fraud.A first step has already been taken with the transformation of UCLAF into Olaf, an independent institution.Now it is important to move the second step, creating a certain legal framework within which the Olaf can act.For this reason, we need a European Public Prosecutor's Office that gives precise legal guarantees also to the suspects.I have to add with regret that my group will not approve this report unanimously, and I hope that some of the colleagues can review their position during the discussion.Unfortunately, it is still feared that a European institution is created here at the expense of subsidiarity.I will do my part so that the report of the honorable Theato meets a wider consensus.Mr. President, we are substantially in favor of the resolution that is presented to us, even if we think that this can only be an invitation from Parliament to the Council so that, through a modification of the treaties, an effective criminal protection of the financial interest of the Union is ensured.The establishment of a European prosecutor and the creation of crime figures common to all the countries of the Union is undoubtedly a good idea, but I consider it impossible to think of creating it without having first introduced a judicial order of the Union.In fact, we are talking about criminal law, the field in which the resistance of national states to the community is and will always be strong.It is not conceivable, in fact, that substantial and procedural legal rules can be achieved for a single sector, which is that of the protection of financial interests, without having first created a European judicial order.It is sufficient to read the precise and comprehensive reasons of the Theato report to realize how many and what the problems are still to be solved.However, this idea must be encouraged and there is no doubt that during this attempt to protect financial interests, we will notice the need to have a community corpus juris to be introduced into the treaties.In my personal name and my group I also express the hope that the financial soul of the Union face as a tread for the realization of a European judicial order respectful of the rights and guarantees of citizens, i.e. a judicial order that raises the guarantees which, unfortunately, in many states are not at an acceptable level.	it
Madame Rothe, I'm going to express myself as follows: I am convinced that the current context has improved to reach such agreements.I have no commitments at the moment.I do not wait for them either before we started direct discussions.They will come later.The context has changed that Helsinki's decisions made a large number of things finally possible and above all that the participants completely changed their political strategy.I have always thought that the old position, according to which Cyprus would only adhere once the political conflict has been regulated, received a weakness, in the sense that it did not convincing the Turkish Cypriot community to really get involved, because, faced with this strategy, the Turkish community had nothing else to do their arms and wait.The question of the membership of Cyprus would not have been raised.Now, the Turkish community must seriously count with the risk that Cyprus really integrates the European Union, with the growing prospects of well-being and security which result from it for the Greek community, while the Turkish community, already much less prosperous, would continue to be distant.I am therefore firmly convinced that the motivation to link the peace process to the settlement of the conflict has increased enormously from Helsinki.It was also the underlying idea.After a few weeks, it is still too early, Madam, to already deliver an assessment, but I have no reason to assume that the new course of action will fail.There is no reason for that.There is still no reason to say that we will succeed but I can really say that the conditions for progress have improved considerably.Last point, the Cypriot question obviously plays a role in discussions with Turkey.During my meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister a few weeks ago in Brussels, I naturally asked Turkey to adopt a positive and constructive attitude towards this issue.However, I issue the following reserve: we cannot be certain a hundred percent - in any case, I am not - that just press a button in Ankara so that everything works in Cyprus!It hasn't been as simple for a long time.Rather, we will have to strive, in our discussions with the two communities, to bring them to an agreement.This is what we do, we have funds and programs for this.I must clearly tell you that I need the financial regulations submitted to your decision so that we can start.Financial settlement is the legal framework to be able to address the priorities provided for in partnerships with Cyprus and Malta.I can't start without that, I miss the legal basis.If the so-called lack of consistency has any relationship with this specific point, I would like to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing else.	fr
I would like to know if the document that the committee has just presented provides for such a clause.Thank you very much, Inger Schörling.These are two important questions.I am happy to have the opportunity to clarify them.No, we should not start with a cost-benefit analysis, but to base ourselves on an evaluation of what we know, what science can teach us and how we must consider it in relation to the risks that we believe to exist for the environment or for the health of men and animals.On the other hand, when we have decided to take a certain measure, we must then choose one that has a good cost-effectiveness, so as not to adopt completely absurd measures from the point of view of efficiency.So do not start with a cost-benefit analysis.The other question concerns the reversal of the burden of proof.It is quite correct that we need to apply it in some cases.I took the case of the strategy with regard to chemicals as a good example of a domain where it is necessary.This is indeed this area, but we can say that this communication on the precautionary principle is horizontal;It concerns all specific political areas.This is the reason why it is not particularly a question of reversal of the burden of proof in this regard or what the burden of proof will look like, but it is rather the political decision-making and the foundations of it.However, it is absolutely exact that we must, for example, when it comes to chemicals, take care to obtain a reversal of the burden of proof.Mr. President, I think that, to function, the precautionary principle should be quite radical, otherwise we are constantly lost in the tortuous meanders of interpretations.Take an example: it is shown that an anticryptogamic product gives birth to blind children;He is therefore teratogenic.Very well, it is an anticryptogamic, an antimstotal.It is a British laboratory that has proven the teratogenic effect, the only one perhaps, however, to have done tests.Well, in my opinion, since the threat is also serious for health, the precautionary principle requires that the product is immediately withdrawn from trade, as did New Zealand for example.I would therefore like to ask the following question: when human health is at stake, or when serious effects on human health are possible, should we analyze costs and profits?A blind child is too high a price in my opinion, no profit could compensate for it.I would like to know if, ultimately, the precautionary principle as you understand it, the commissioner, would presuppose in this case that the product is removed from the sale until other laboratories provide the contrary.Mr. President, I am the first to hope that we can use the precautionary principle so that it is considered radical in terms of protecting men's health and the environment.	fr
The White Paper and the relationship come at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection, discussion and reform, which is not yet concluded, remaining to clarify various questions, of the judges, of the Member States and above all of the small and medium -sized enterprises concerned.Competition policy must continue to be managed centrally and cannot be renationalized, because this would be risky for the internal market and for the position of Europe in the world economy, but must be Europeanized in the framework of subsidiarity.Therefore I also welcome that the responsibility starts from the individual, without however the commission escapes its own.Practical experience - with only nine cases rejected and 94 per 100 of cases subject to the commission resolved not formally, but through non -public and legally non -binding administrative letters, or simply for the start of the terms - clearly indicates that the commission's activity has affected temporal, personal and financial limits of the era of globalization and expansion of the European Union.In conclusion, I wish to announce my expectations towards the reform: an equity and equality of conditions, legal security for all companies, uniform application of competition policy, procedural simplification on the basis of the one-stop-shop principle, coordination of the national competition authorities, which I consider autonomously, a close relationship between authorities and national judges and the Commission, as well as a clear attribution of competences between the authorities and the national judges, when it is the national judges,apply the European competition law;From the commission I expect that it focuses on the essential elements in the fulfillment of his mandate as a maximum custodian of the European competition policies.I am curious to see which form the wide discussions will take when they up to the first legislative proposal.The Commission report confirms that, with the exception of Germany, state aid to companies are increasing and this worries the Commission, not only from the point of view of the conditions of competition.As far as we are concerned, we set ourselves in the perspective of the interest of the working classes.The company does not take any advantage from these enormous transfers of public funds to private companies.Just look at the automotive sector, in which various grants and aids of the states increased by 24 percent during the reference period.For what purpose?Not to maintain employment, because all these companies have suppressed jobs and proceeded with layoffs.Not to improve working conditions, because by making a fewer number of employees produce the working conditions worsen.Did these companies need state help to survive?No, businesses in the automotive sector collect colossal profits for years.State aid not only have perverse effects, because as they recognize in the report of the honorable Jonckheer cause the hunt for the grants through transfers of activity from one country to another, but are also unacceptable, because they use public money for the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders.The fact that wherever the richest with the state money are favored has led in the whole of Europe to deteriorating the social state, to the abandonment of public services, to the closure of hospitals.	it
Faced with this world framework for change we have to find the position that corresponds to us.Fortunately, EC's help evaluations give us an important means of improving what we are doing and hopefully also overcoming the challenges I just mentioned.To occupy in more detail the results that the evaluations have given, I would like to mention the following problems: the objections of community policy are too numerous and too imprecise and that negatively affects coherence.This situation is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to some very clear inconsistencies between sectoral policies and interests of the Member States.The Commission has a help system that is too complex and that is too fragmented in terms of instruments, procedure and institutional mechanisms.Often the policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by the objectives they had and for clearly defined priorities.Human resources are too scarce in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage.On average, for the management of ten million dollars of aid there are 2.9 people in the commission, compared to 4.3 at the World Bank and between four and nine in the main Member States.This raises a real problem: there are many and very different financial instruments, each of which has its own characteristics and particularly a series of different budgetary titles.It is difficult to harmonize this situation with the needs of an effective management system.In order to face these problems and solve them, the community has to establish an effective dialogue with the Member States and Parliament.It is absolutely indispensable that we address the issue of coherence in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means that we must sustain the debate in the appropriate institutional framework, that is, in the Council and in Parliament.The lack of concerted action between the 15 Member States and between them and the community also requires study.If we focus on the community development policy on strategies and objectives agreed at the international level, we will prepare the way for a better complementarity with the Member States.This largely coincides with what the Amado Minister has just said.When we talk about policies today, we are referring to a convergence process.This already gives us a part of the solution.We are in the process of formulating new regulatory guidelines and we have to identify priority spheres for community action.Everything is increasingly complicated.The same can be said of development cooperation.There is not a single donor that is in a position to deal with the entire range of issues, ranging from macroeconomic issues to the regulatory framework or from sector policies to a diversity of new interrelated issues such as gender, the environment, good public management and institutional reforms.It is important to find flexible mechanisms that can accommodate a division of labor according to the technical knowledge and the ability of the various donors in each developing country.This must be done at the level of the Member States and should lead us to the formulation of sector policies for community action.That is what we want to get.To identify the priority areas of support of the CE, the specific characteristics of the community in relation to the Member States and with international institutions must be taken into account.	es
"This current economic context is very present in our mind, since the objective of these restructuring is to rationalize the management of companies.While it is plausible, from the economic point of view, to make structural modifications to be more competitive and gain market share, this analysis can be condemnable when it is carried out at the request of the financial, often shareholders, with the only purpose, unconstable, to increase the financial values ​​of these companies, and thus be able to increase the benefits that they will obtain.In this sense, the different recent ads, mentioned by my colleagues, both in the case of Michelin and in Goodyear, are symptomatic.A rationalized management, as well as an improvement of the results -in my opinion, and by order of priority, must be at the service of the company and, therefore, of the workers, and then, eventually, the financial consequences that arise from it.However, today we attend a phenomenon of concentration, regrouping of companies and relocation, with the consequences we know - both with respect to the quality of the products and the social plane specifically - from the point of view of unemployment, of more difficult working conditions, of greater flexibility, consequences that are dramatic in the human level, especially for the family cell.There is, therefore, the danger of the planet becoming a two -phase: on the one hand, poor countries, labor suppliers and, on the other, rich countries, capital suppliers.Should Europe be the barrier to maintain some balance between greater profitability and greater well -being?Do not forget that what basically makes a company work and have good results is human capital.To conclude, I will remind you that the third letter of the name of the EDD group, to which I belong, means ""difference.""Europe has the duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to non -planned restructuring and with a view to ""all benefit"", the voice of the difference in this uniformized wave of restructuring.Mr. President, last month in the United Kingdom, in a region adjacent to mine, the Michelin group announced a considerable number of layoffs at its Stoke-on-TRent plant due to the company's restructuring and the increase in global competitiveness in the world market of tires.I, like all the deputies present, regret this loss of jobs.In the same way, I regret the announcement made by Goodyear that has led to this resolution.But, certainly, I doubt that a European Employment Council would have been able to change this business decision.This assembly is very good by issuing resolutions and legislating and sometimes, in this institution, we forget that Europe cannot survive alone.We need multinational companies that base their businesses on our continent.In the few months that I have been amazing here that while we all talk about encouraging companies to grow in the EU, practically all the resolutions that we approve encourage them to abandon it.In our last plenary session of Brussels we vote the directive on vehicles at the end of its useful life and we try to make their standards retroactive, adding huge costs for European car manufacturers that could not have planned.Two days later, Toyota, who employs several thousand people in my region, announced that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but also could lead to dismissals in his derbyyshire plant."	es
And this, because this agenda is limited to only three subjects which concern in a fragmentary manner only two of the institutional bodies of the European Union.I will not repeat them, moreover, since they are known to everyone.This finding is justified on the one hand because of the permanent demand which is made, sometimes very intensely by European citizens, and on the other hand because of the enormous dimensions of this large company in which the European Union has already launched, that of enlargement.With this data, the new intergovernmental conference cannot fail to include subjects on its agenda whose treatment would guarantee the regular functioning of all and not of a few European Union institutions.As also he should understand subjects that affect daily life, and therefore obvious in the eyes of the European citizen.Mr. President, dear colleagues, the European Parliament, during numerous discussions and having regard to the many reports established so far, has openly formed in favor of the summons of the intergovernmental conference.At the same time, I ask, however, that subjects that improve and complete the reform, and I repeat, of all institutional bodies be included.But it would also be necessary to add subjects which directly concern European citizens.As for example, health, energy, culture, transport, even tourism.On the one hand, the question of whether the extension of the agenda will be achieved is still under discussion.And at this stage, I would really like to emphasize the political conduct of the Portuguese presidency, which, repeatedly, has committed itself before the European Parliament to deploy all its efforts in this direction.On the other hand, the question of the increase in the number of discussion matters in no way decreases the importance given by each member country to the intergovernmental conference because the institutional framework on the basis of which will evolve Europe in the future is the fundamental principle of European integration and therefore is of supreme national importance for each member country of the Union.Mr. President, dear colleagues, I ask the Assembly, having read this data, to approve the opinion that Mr. Leinen and I presented before you, so that the work of the intergovernmental conference begins on February 14 and that our two representatives to it, Mr. Brok and Mr. Tsatsos, can, in accordance with the opinion of the European Parliament, undertake the difficult work that awaits them.The same goes for the European Commission, and I would once like to thank the Commissioner Barnier for his contacts with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he presented to us.Mr. President, the group of the European People's Party is not satisfied with the outcome of the Helsinki European Council.The agenda seemed relatively insufficient to us, because we were based on the logic of the treaty and, more specifically, on the protocol relating to the institutions of the Union.In Helsinki, governments have agreed to say that as long as the Union is made up of less than 21 states, minimis reform would suffice, but that with more members, it would be necessary reform.	fr
Ladies and gentlemen, this decade maybe, I would even say must be, that of Europe.Madam President, the Chairman of the Commission, dear colleagues, the group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome what the Commission has filed a document to prepare it.We also salute the conclusions we find in this document.In addition, we salute, in broad outline, the speech that the president of the commission, Mr. Prodi, has just pronounced.The conclusions of the document indicate that the five -year mandate of the Prodi Commission will be a major change period.Europe will progress in its integration and the Union will, at the same time, engage a phase of enlargement which will ultimately lead to the reunification of our continent.It is ambitious, we could even say prophetic.Mr. Chairman of the Commission, we wish you that this can succeed in this way.But we also say that the present is the foundation of the future and that we can only shape the future if we are proving in the present.I say it seriously and I say it with concern!I thus discuss the current discussion on the conflicts which divide the European Union at the moment.We, the European Union, are a community!We belong to the same set, even when there are problems.It is not the time not to isolate but to bring together and to carry out, together, this work of unification of Europe!Mr. Chairman of the Commission, in recent weeks, you have represented and defended the European Parliament on several occasions.You have considered yourself the Guardian of Treaties - which is your role.We expressly show you our respect, recognition and support for this, including for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria that you mentioned.(Applause) Mr. Chairman of the Commission, we agree with you on the objectives: in the 21st century, we want a strong Europe, which has the capacity to act and which is democratic.A Europe that defends its values ​​of human dignity, democracy and the rule of law, both inside and outside, and which at the same time ensures its interests in the world with dignity, patience and convincing confidence.The message of Europe, of the European Union, in the world cannot be arrogance or even European nationalism, no;Rather, it is to fall under cooperation, partnership and peaceful development.Globalization therefore represents, for us, the possibility of organizing this world which is getting closer more under the sign of peaceful competition and solidarity.Seen from this angle, globalization presents more chances than dangers, more comparisons than separations, more mutual enrichment than limitation.But we also know that we cannot meet these major challenges of globalization that together as Europeans.Globalization is not only an economic process but also a cultural process.We therefore say that we want a partnership in the world, we do not want - as some predict some - of a confrontation of cultures, of a clash of civilization;Rather, we want partnership, meeting, exchange and peace.	fr
In this area it is also proven that the structure of the economy differs from one state to another and that the roads by which the current level diverge has been reached.Therefore, it is not good for a single policy to be applied, which would probably be full of exceptions and adaptations.It would mean that the Member States be private without apparent foundation of some tasks that correspond to them and that the Brussels bureaucracy intervenes without the need for it.It is preferable for Member States to adopt themselves measures that foster employment.Obviously, they understand more of this matter than the commission.Hence my reluctance regarding the adoption of community measures regarding employment promotion, even when it comes to the tourism sector.It would really cause us a great disgust that, despite everything, the Parliament tried to achieve this goal unofficially extending its competences.Mr. President, as you will understand, we cannot subscribe the resolution in front of us in your current version.First, I would like to thank Mr. Viceconte for all the work done in this report.It is a very extensive report.We pleasantly greet this report as we greet the original report on which it has been based, the high -level group report established by the European Commission.I trust that the European Commission does not forget this.Having established it I hope that the European Commission effectively uses it and, therefore, does not allow it to languish in the halls and be covered with dust.Tourism consists basically small businesses and therefore constitutes a very fertile area for job creation.As already said in this debate, three million potential jobs for the next ten years is something that is worth fighting.Europe can no longer reject recognition - both in economic terms and political action - that the fastest growth sector of its economy deserves for its economic and social position.We need a more dynamic vision based on the contribution of tourism to job creation.We must recognize a sector that predominantly relates to cross -border activities and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating, innovative and active approach for sustainable business development.I know that the commissioner is very interested in computer science.He has convinced me of it.But their computer and tourism portfolios, in fact, marry together.There are various reasons why tourism is an ideal breeding ground for integrating job creation strategies.Let's look at some of these reasons.The importance of tourism for the economy and its growth potential is evident.Several sectors of the population are used by the tourism industry, especially the most vulnerable groups such as young people, women and workers without qualification.I am not saying that it is not necessary to improve the qualification within the sector - since we have to do it - but we first consolidate the jobs.The availability of non -qualified, temporary and seasonal work is very important in some economic areas of the community.	es
I will just mention only a few: our ability to combine development policy with commercial policy and to ensure that there are synergies between help and economic cooperation;our neutrality and defense of supreme community interests;The fact that we represent a critical mass and are in a position to face relatively large challenges compared to what each of our member states can normally do.I do not forget our presence on the ground: fundamentally it seems to me that the maximum value we represent is the fact that, being how we are a regional cooperation company that acts successfully, we can see us as an associate neutral and desired for that experiment worldwide;That is something that nobody, apart from us, can pretend.It is essential that community policy be more effective and that we develop a more cooperative strategic framework.That double challenge is the one that the Commission has to face, for which in the coming months you will have to prepare a proposal in the form of a general policy declaration.We will initiate a broad and open consultation process in order to gather the opinions of all the different stakeholders.I consider that this process is almost as important as its content, and we will assign all our resources to an active participation and we will invite everyone to participate with us.At the same time we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and openly highlighting the real or imaginary problems with which we stumble in that regard.That will be a continuous process that I consider as a kind of permanent effort of quality control, and I invite the Parliament to participate in that continuous effort destined to improve the coherence of what we are doing.Mr. President, first of all, I thank Mr. Amado, as well as Mr. Nielson, his words.I am also glad that Mr. Amado has referred to the Fed.The problem is not found here, in this Parliament, and neither in the Commission;The Council must take the necessary steps to establish the Fed budget, therefore, this sermon must really pronounce on the Council.Mr. President, I also thank Mr. Nielson.He has referred widely to the new Lomé Agreement, but this is certainly not the matter of this morning's meeting.We wanted to talk about coherence.That is the subject.Since the early 1990s, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council of Ministers have recognized that the coherence of European policy does not operate properly, especially in the field of development policy and other policies of the Union.Attention has been requested for this problem on several occasions: in 1992, in 1995 and 1997. All examples appear in the resolution before us.I have asked questions about this issue for years.The obligation that there is coherence is even introduced to the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997. In addition, in 1998 it was agreed that the European Commission prepared an annual report in which the advances made should be collected.But what have we seen since then?Good words, also today, but no report.It is too ridiculous to explain it.	es
"To speak frankly, a hierarchy of oppression was created.And as long as citizens are not equal before the law, this inequality leads to discrimination and erosion of human rights.In our process of expanding within the EU, we have focused, with reason, on human rights and the protection of minorities.We must not derogate from this commitment.But we must also look at us in the mirror and recognize our own imperfections.Yes, conventions have been signed, but we must act.I would recommend that you carry out continuous audits concerning human rights practices, constant vigilance, not only outside our borders but also inside.This is why I would appreciate an annual report on the part of all Member States having to report any complaint concerning him and the action undertaken, because what is happening in a Member State touches us all.What is happening in another part of the world affects us.The case of Pinochet in Chile is as important as that of Haider in Austria.Human rights and civil freedoms are inextricably linked.Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are linked to our development policies, to our economic policies, to our internal affairs policies;They are in fact at the height of our democratic functions.I will repeat what Mr. Patten said: We must commit, we must inform, educate and therefore make real and lasting changes.Mr. President, ""Europe represents ideals, values ​​and principles. We must honor the intellectual history of Europe. We must rehabilitate the values ​​that unite it. Intellectual life is part of Europe to spread throughout the world. We must live with our conscience.""Thus was expressed three hours ago, in this hemicycle, the Czech President Mr. Vaclav Havel.In a particularly edifying discourse, marked by the knowledge of men, wisdom, historical knowledge and understanding of the intellectual and Christian heritage of Europe, he indicated the sources of inspiration to which our work in favor of human dignity and human rights should draw.We must be grateful that our Europe has heads of state of the caliber of Mr. Vaclav Havel.I would like to mention two subjects.It is first of all that of civil society.Mr. Vaclav Havel said earlier that the communist regimes of Eastern Europe methodically destroyed civil society: popular movements, churches and independent unions.This is what happens in China, with the Falun Gong movement and the Catholic and Protestant churches.This is also what happens to Tibetan Lamaism.We must never forget to defend civil society.I would also like to mention the question of the death penalty.The EU, just like my own country, Sweden, has the basis of a vision of the world centered on equality between men and on the unique and inviolable value of human existence.Starting from this principle, one must always leave the man a chance to return to his actions.It must be said to the government of the United States, the Russian government and the Chinese government.Mr. President, Mr. President in office, Mr. Commissioner, in my opinion, the approach of the EU member states in Geneva should aim to place the situations of Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and China."	fr
"Hence, this first agreement with Macedonia is crucial, since it will be the model.I am convinced that the other four countries wonder: what will happen?What will the European Union do with Macedonia?Will it do the same with us?As that model constitutes the first advance, it is so important.Macedonia is also a model in another sense.The rapporteur has already pointed it very clearly.The question of inter -ethnic relationships.It is not necessary that we reproduce it here in a too idealistic way.During the presidential elections it seemed that it did not work at all so well, but compared to the rest of the region, it could be discussed the Macedonian model.It would earn a lot if we managed to export that model together with the Macedonians to the rest of the Western Balkans.This prototype is also valid in the field of regional cooperation.I agree with the rapporteur as long as a balance must be achieved between, on the one hand, the promotion of regional cooperation and, on the other, maintain the opening to Bulgaria and Greece, and not close it.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, if we take this first step, he will have won a lot.If we spoil it, it will have lost much more.Mr. President, allow me to record in the first place that I have no problem to approve, in principle, this well -elaborate report.I just want to attract attention to an issue that, in my opinion, has not been discussed in the report and that constitutes a serious problem for Macedonia and for the effectiveness of financial and other help that the EU provides.I speak of the sanctions to Yugoslavia.So that there are no misunderstandings: I also consider it necessary to address the problem of the Milosevic regime with decision.But, in the first place, these sanctions affect a broad and negative measured to many neighboring states, among which Macedonia is, which are in a very complicated economic situation.Secondly, in a politically counterproductive way, the entire Yugoslav people of Milosevic and its clique are responsible, thus violating human rights.Consequently, I believe that, as stated in amendment No. 10, the topic that is discussed today should lead us to quickly end this sanctions policy.Mr. President, ladies, it has not been necessary to end the Kosovo conflict to conclude that, after several wars in the territory of former Yugoslavia with its innumerable negative consequences in the stability of the Balkan zone, a global and lasting strategy for the entire region would be necessary in order to guarantee peace and stability in the sweaty Europe.This strategy, which became a form in the stability pact, approved on June 10, 1999 in Colonia, considers the region of Southeast Europe, but at the same time recognizes diversity and inequality in the development of the various countries that compose it.The contribution of the European Union in the field of stability pact, embodied in the so-called ""stabilization and association process"", represents the development of the regional conception that the European Community prepared in 1996 for the five countries of the region -bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslava Republic of Macedonia and Albania- and whose most important aspect consisted of the establishment in the establishmentof political and economic conditions aimed at supporting the execution of the Dayton Peace Agreement, which should contribute to regional stability."	es
Within the Member States, regional disparities deepen dangerously.Just dwell on the data contained in the sixth periodic report to realize the strong acceleration recorded in the last ten years by the regional springs.The attention dedicated to the colossal problems of the union of the union is laughable, when not even non -existent, just as the infrastructure deficiencies in terms of transport, communications and energy condemn these areas to the desolation.Not only regional policy is responsible for this state of affairs, but also the economic and social policies implemented in general by the Union.Vast layers of the population condemn these policies as dangerous and repressive.Unfortunately, the new guidelines do not mark any change of route and nothing lets hypothesize that, with their application, something can never change.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, I am allowed to intervene briefly to highlight two points of the relationships in question, which cover an essential strategic importance in our vision of the union.The first concerns the essential and central importance that we continue to attribute to economic and social cohesion.Therefore, the voices according to which the importance of this objective would be stupid in the Considerations of the Commission are concerned.We continue to think that economic and social cohesion is a central objective of the Union.The second is in agreement with the comments expressed by a colleague on the question of the islands, and I would like to attract attention to the ultra -repenering regions.In the future we would like to be able to ascertain greater courage in the treatment of issues concerning the ultra -aperitical regions such as, in the case of my country, the Azores and Madera islands.I take this opportunity to ask the Commission to explain to us the reasons for the delay of his report on the ultra -aperitical regions that Parliament has been waiting for for a long time.Mr. President, I thank first of all also for the availability to welcome our suggestions in the relationship.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, Mr. Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to provide the Member States with an orientation to achieve the reform objectives in the framework of the programming.However, contrary to the claim to provide guidelines, the indications of the Commission on the matter represent a catalog of possible measures within the framework of the various intervention sectors.Their original sense would instead be to indicate the direction and the priorities.I share the opinion of the rapporteur according to which the Commission document unfortunately contains insufficient recommendations to the Member States to proceed with administrative simplification.I also subscribe to the requests to focus attention during negotiations with the Member States on areas such as the promotion of a favorable environment for small and medium -sized companies with high labor intensity, setting clear objectives in favor of the creation of alternative financing sources, including the programs regarding risk capital and private funding, support services for new companies as well as new information technologies and investments in innovative sectors.In particular, an amendment presented by the political group to which I belong to point 10, aimed at ensuring adequate participation by the private sector in the planning and execution of the projects.	it
In the fourth place, the Parliament, considering the merits recognized in Life, has enrolled in its annual budget growing amounts intended for this program, so that the approval of the proposal supported by the Council and the Commission would entail an unacceptable turnaround.Our concerns, however, are not limited to financial aspect.Climate change and water resources management policy are a source of great fears for European citizens and have already enjoyed great attention from this assembly.We therefore believe it is essential to approve our amendments nos.5 and 6, aimed at defining the concepts of sustainable management of underground and superficial water and reduction of gases that produce the greenhouse effect, including them among the objectives of Life-Environment.I conclude to congratulate me with the honorable Lienemann for the relationship elaborated and I take this opportunity to communicate to her that, although our preference for the accompaniment of Life goes to a consultative committee - as has been demonstrated unequivocally within the Environment Commission -, we will vote in favor of its amendments on the Committeeology because we do not want to contribute to the realization of the Council's proposal, which we consider frankly.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, Life is the most important financial instrument, the only financial instrument, in reality, of which the European Union disposes that it is intended exclusively for the environment.This tool must therefore absolutely respond to our ambitions, ambitions that undoubtedly have a price.The nerve point of the discussion with the Council will obviously be the allocation for Life III.The common position provides for a package of 613 million euros for the period 2000-2004, an insufficient figure.The liberal group is in favor of the increase in this sum for 850 million euros.Consequently, we will support the amendment of the honorable Lienemann, which underlines how the funds intended for Life have not been the subject of any increase at the time of the last expansion of the Union, not to mention the new round of candidate countries.The funds we request do not represent a mountain of unnecessary expenses.On the contrary, they still do not reach the levels necessary to cover the actual needs.A drop in the sea, I would say, compared to the structural policies of Europe.The environment definitely plays a second floor role within the European budget, although it represents first of all an investment, an investment in natural resources, certainly, but also in employment, since it has been shown that an active environmental policy is able to create new jobs, as it is evident from the great success achieved by Life: a success for NGOs, companies, local authorities, third countries.Almost a third of the 8,500 questions joined were satisfied with the required conditions and about 1,300 projects received a co -financing between 1992 and 1998. A success that, according to the precise will of this parliament, must last over time.Which is why we support amendment no.14 which defines, broadly, the fourth phase of the life of the Life project.When we talk about the environment, investment and ambitions they are realities that must exist on the long term.The future of the new generations is at stake.?(FR) Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, perhaps I will repeat what has already been stated by colleagues, but I think it is necessary to reiterate for the umpteenth time, for the benefit of the Council, what we think of Life.	it
I believe there is an agreement on the fact that the waste and residues of the ships must be disposed of in ports.The logical consequence, it could not be otherwise, is the following: the number one rule for the conservation of seas clean is that disposal on the high seas must no longer be advantageous.This is the point, and we discussed it in this parliament by reaching a majority.In January, Mrs. Commissioner, we held with her a very comprehensive debate on the consequences of the accident of the oil tanker Erika and on this occasion we once again reviewed all the fundamental points to guarantee safe ships and clean seas.Even the directive on port systems for waste and the load residues we are examining concerns precisely what can be done because the seas are cleaner.A single data, by way of information: every year, only in the North Sea, 70,000 cubic meters of waste is illegally discharged and, vice versa, only at the Maxim 5-10 percent maximum of the ships follows the correct procedure, or provides for the disposal of waste in ports.A similar scandal is also unacceptable for the Council.The Council also maintains that all ports must have adequate collection systems and must equip.The conflict in practice only concerns the issue of costs coverage.In the first reading, the Parliament, in a large majority, had argued that the same ships must contribute at least 90 percent to the extent.Here is the difference with respect to the Council which instead proposes a non -defined contribution, but such a contribution could also be equivalent to half a euro, that is, evidently too little in this case: so it would not change anything, there would be no economic pressure on ships to take on a consequent line of behavior.A flat -rate contribution to disposal for all ships is necessary, regardless of the actual use of disposal systems, or the economic incentive to download at sea must fall.In the Baltic Sea this was possible - some colleagues have already remembered it - thanks to the Helmkom convention, which provides for a no special fee system.If it worked there it should also be able to work in the other European seas, because only the environment is not at stake, but the clean waters, tourism, and, fundamental, alongside the environmental considerations, neutrality in terms of competition is also involved.The conditions applicable in ports to ships must be the same for everyone and only if these conditions are set together by Parliament, Commission and Council can be restored the neutrality of the conditions of competition for ports and ships.I believe that the credibility of the union and particularly of Parliament is also at stake.People are tired of the hypocrisy of Europe and ministers in the face of catastrophes, as we have seen in the case of Erika.When the oil is poured on the coasts, the politicians, the ministers appear, and they are busy, each with his own nice bucket to clean the beaches, but when, after two weeks, it is at the age of the day a severe directive, the beautiful words of the day before are already forgotten.	it
"The nature of the Union has not changed.From the beginning, it acted according to some dozens of large financial and industrial groups and the related lobbies.But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the European Union in order to nominate it to the direction of the world alongside the United States, while entering with them in competition and in conflict.This new imperial policy presupposes the reorganization of European and national institutions, the consolidation of state power, greater competition, the establishment of a European army and the redistribution of financial resources.That you still dare to invoke the defense of a ""European social model"" is a shameful lie because the more the European Union fights the United States, the more it becomes a clone.We will therefore vote against these objectives as we oppose this policy both within the classroom and on the streets.The elaboration of a European Fundamental Rights Charter would be the only glimmer of light within such a policy, but once again nothing has been foreseen so that the peoples of Europe can be able to deal with democratically.We abstained to vote for the resolution for the following reasons.First of all, the resolution does not report with sufficient clarity the somewhat vague nature of the priorities and commitments formulated in the commission program.Secondly, we believe that, as part of the definition of priorities for the next 5 years, the main question that the Commission must face concerns its role in the framework of interinstitutional relationships within the European Union - and in this context they are not mentioned neither the program nor the resolution.In our opinion, there is a factor that will condition the role that the Commission will play in the near future and which is connected to the return of the European political initiative by the governments of the Member States following the failure of the Santer Commission.We believe that this aspect is extremely positive, since in this way the national parliaments, on which governments depend, continue to be able to claim the essentials of their democratic mandate in the construction of Europe.The truth is that the European Parliament continues not to conquer trust and not even the interest of public opinion, which insists not to think in European terms, as evidenced by the percentage of abstention recorded on the occasion of the last elections.Therefore it is necessary to strengthen the mechanisms used for the purposes of cooperation between the governments of the Member States, giving them greater consistency, transparency and democracy.We welcome the commitment of President Prodi aimed at improving the public image of the Commission and we agree on the need for the latter to consult with Parliament and Council.In our opinion, however, the maximum priority to the reform of the government cooperation mechanisms, in particular through the creation of a Council of Ministers for Europe which, in concert between them and in coordination with the other European institutions, allows to transform the political decisions taken in the context of European councils must be attributed.Corrie Report (A5-0032/2000) Mrs. President, the works of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1999 were characterized by a growing concern for the perenniality of the cooperation model deriving from the Lomé agreements.Since 1994, with a first resolution to which our colleague had widely contributed, Honorable Dominique Souchet, the joint assembly had alarmed for the predictable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which had contradicted the very principle of community preference, indispensable for cooperation."	it
President, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues!I also thank the rapporteur for this excellent report.I also agree with his conclusions, in which he particularly suggests increasing the number of speakers of the judges at the Court of Justice of the first instance and giving the Court of Justice of his own translation service.I actually think this is necessary because we heard when visiting the legal committee in Luxembourg, that of course inevitably, inevitably, so to speak, when using the joint translation service, the Court of Justice has preceded the Court of Court before the court of the first instance and therefore often important things in the court of first instance cannot be adequately treated.But I also believe that the reforms have to go further than what we will now decide here.I think, for example, it is worth considering, for example, in the areas where saying bodies that are already like a court like that decide in advance - I only call the keyword Alicante or as is also planned for European civil service law - to make the first instance court and to establish a final responsibility here.I also see that we probably have to do something in connection with the tendencies at the European Commission to renationalize competition decisions again and to relocate to the national level.Here it seems to me to think about thinking about it, because these cases no longer land first instance at the court, but rather as reference would be made at the Court.We should consider how we will finish this situation.Maybe there should also be the possibility of making lectures in competitive matters to the specialized Chamber of the Court of the first instance.In addition, one also has to consider whether it is correct - and we had cases in which MPs or factions against the European Parliament have sued - that the first instance is responsible for such questions, although constitutional issues are actually touched and that these things logically actually belong to the Court of Justice and less before the first instance court.One last point: I also believe that Olaf needs control under the rule of law.At the moment Olaf is in a vacant space and can do what it wants.I think it is necessary for a court to control Olaf.The only court that can do this reasonably would be the first instance court.That would also be a suggestion for the further reform process.Mr President, I would like to join those who congratulated the rapporteur on his work.The European Union is a system that relies on the right.It must therefore have dishes that can implement this right.In addition, if the courts can not treat the legal matters with which they are dealt with appropriately and quickly, what Ms. de Palacio Vallelersundi has already mentioned, namely that a delayed case law is known to become a refused case law.The report on the Court proves that this is currently happening, and it shows which steps to contain the problem can now be undertaken.But, as Mr. Marinho said, more has to be done, but that has to wait until the government conference.	de
If we had had such arrangements, I repeat, the disaster would probably not have occurred.This is why we think that we must review the applicable texts and, in particular, the 1992 protocol which exempt the charters, in this case the charter oil, from all responsibility.However, if the charterer is exempt, it is of course less involved in the controls of oil companies.You must therefore review the regulations and thank you, Madam Commissioner, for pointing all the current inadequacies of European provisions.In addition, we must above all, you have said, strengthen controls: those of the state of the pavilion, those of classification companies.You told us that Rina was an Italian classification register recognized by the Commission.Under what conditions is this recognition?What are the reliability guarantees?You will send a mission.We expect the results with great interest.It is also necessary to strengthen the controls of the maritime authorities, control in European ports.It exists, it must be remembered, a memorandum of Paris, which involves a minimum of control, a quarter of the boats released in European ports to be controlled by the maritime authorities of the country concerned.This obligation is not respected, neither in France, nor in many other European countries.For what ?What are the consequences that has already been drawn or is about to draw the commission?It also seems to me necessary to strengthen control over the charter, in this case the oil tanker.If its financial responsibility is engaged, no doubt this control will be more exercised.Finally, coordination of maritime authorities is necessary to achieve a sort of European system similar to the coast guards who monitor the coasts of the United States.I would first like to thank my colleagues in charge of the environment within my group for having addressed this particular problem in a joint manner with their team responsible for transport.This disaster affects both transport and the environment and is not confined to an area.We are again in the Parliament to debate yet another maritime disaster.I could detail the list of disasters that struck this sector during my ten years of presence within the Parliament but I only have three minutes.There is no doubt that it is high time that the Member States but also this paper tiger known as the International Maritime Organization and, last but not Least, the oil companies as well as the owners of oilmen assume their responsibility by acting to put an end to these ecological and human tragedies which repeat themselves over the years.How many Erikas must we bear to make the authorities formed provide us with an appropriate control system carried out by the state of the port which is effective everywhere within the European Union and not only in certain regions?How much pollution should we still undergo before the industry builds oil tankers with separate tanks and double hulls?	fr
The main world financial centers would be far from donating the proceeds of the Tobin Tax to finance humanitarian and benefit interventions of the UN, without being able to draw any tangible advantage.As regards the function of the Tobin Tax to prevent future currency crises, it must be remembered that this would not eliminate the causes of the overvaluation.That's why, as Mr Karas said, this assignment should be entrusted to the political bodies responsible for the overview of certain currencies with respect to their real value;Also, after the adoption of control measures for evaluating imports and exports.Otherwise this would not be achievable.Despite the apparent wisdom of the Tobin Tax, this hides several obstacles and, personally, I think it will be difficult to find an agreement on its introduction.It must be remembered that today money is above all information and that in the future the world economy will be based on it and human resources.That's why the uninterrupted flow of capital between the world financial centers has not only a mere speculative character without any link with the real economy.If with tax tools such as the Tobin Tax you will try to influence this feed-back mechanism, which offers operators freedom of choice, the economic consequences would have an extremely high price and higher than the proceeds that could be obtained with the tax.Having said that, I repeat what Mr Karas rightly said, namely that our group definitely opposes the adoption of the Tobin Tax.Madam President, I speak as supporter of a tax movements of capital mirroring through currency borders.It seems to me completely lapalissian that it is necessary to intervene.In the last 30 years the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times: first of all, the total global reserves of all the central banks barely amount to the value of the operations carried out in a single day on the change market;Second, the annual global exchange of real goods and services is equivalent to just three and a half days out of 350 of activities of the changes of the changes, that is, 1 percent of capital movements serve the exchange of goods and services and 99 percent are intended for speculation.The dimensions, unpredictability and irrationality of the global changes of changes have made it increasingly difficult to manage national and regional economies.The purchase and sale programs managed via computer have transformed any bip into an avalanche, which has overwhelmed jobs, lives and businesses all over the world.The only arguments disadvantage are: first, the tax would jeopardize the efficiency of the change market - a little imaginative in the light of the speculative follies that we have seen to destroy jobs all over the world, in the East Asia, in Europe and in Latin America.Chirac described people dedicated to this type of operations, the AIDS virus of the world economy.It is necessary to throw some sand into the gears of currency speculators, stock exchange agents and financial operators.It is obvious that this cannot be done in one country, nor in the context of a single currency area, but it could be done internationally with a global cooperation.	it
Because of the extremely positive and constructive reactions that were expressed in the consultation period last month, we feel extremely encouraged, and I therefore think that despite a slight delay in the design and application of the reforms, the understanding and commitment, which were conscious by us, are brought to an intensive implementation.I would be happy to see a faster implementation of the matters, but it is better to handle it as properly.Mrs. President!We admire Mr. Kinnock's mind and realism.Because while he draws the image of a well -functioning, powerful administration, he also refers to the difficulties that will arise and that are already predictable.Mr. Prodi said the commission will deport certain tasks.The political priorities must therefore have already been presented.But it is more important to explain what you want to do before you get rid of certain things.I can imagine that you would otherwise have a lot of people against yourself.The expansion is that I mean the expansion of the Union, one of the major challenges.I would also like to point out that the preservation of peace will require far more effort to activate many more people in this area.We have to move away from the rather bureaucratic approach, as is now being practiced in the entire development cooperation, and resolutely take a course for cooperation for peace.Can Mr. Kinnock indicate what he is expecting from the council and what he expects from Parliament in relation to the timing of such priorities?I thank Ms. Maes not only for her comments that have just been put up, but above all for her tireless commitment to changes that she has shown since the beginning of her MP.I would like to assure her that we have no motivation to give matters, but we focus on main tasks and focuses, not about avoiding any obligations, but to provide the absolute guarantee that we can fulfill the most important obligations that we have.These obligations are certainly - and I agree with Ms. Maes - the preparation of an effective, friction and problem -free expansion, which works for mutual benefits both of the people of the interpreting countries and the citizens of the current Union.To be able to guarantee that we can perceive this absolutely important role as a catalyst of the expansion with the greatest possible effectiveness is one of the reasons to ensure that we concentrate on our priorities with conscience and strictly.Furthermore, I would like to tell her that the mechanisms for strategic planning and program position, which are made possible by a measures -related administration and whose introduction we intend, may occur as if they were terribly dry and unnecessary every little bit of idealism.However, since I have been brought up in the faith that the victory must be organized, I may be able to ask you to understand and support our mechanistic views, since it is about the great and central concerns of the Union and its expansion.I hope that with regard to the degree of cooperation and partnership that we entertain with the Council and Parliament in all questions of this policy, not only an immediate and effective implementation of the development of political measures can take place, but also that we will be able to proceed at the right time, which means that we will achieve the greatest possible benefit for the Union.	de
We also need more strict criteria for the interpretation of the results of the controls.The most important parts of amendments 25 and 73 of the Parliament can therefore be accepted in principle.The new definition contained in amendment 72 is however too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose.I would suggest that amendment 92 be incorporated into a wider solution.Amendment 71 does not take into account seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of groundwater.The proposal cannot therefore be accepted.The Commission considers that it is not very realistic and unnecessary to establish standards which ensure that the treatment of the least intensive water purification is sufficient to produce quality drinking water from surface water.On the contrary, we prefer an annex to the measures required under article 11 to encourage actions in this area.The status required under this proposal must ensure that the requirements for good quality surface water are satisfied.This part of amendment 41 cannot therefore be accepted.The Commission appreciates the efforts of the Parliament aimed at ensuring that said combined approach is given a central role.Amendments 22 and 47 define this approach and its scope, which the Commission may approve in principle.To obtain the largest legal clarity and proportionality, we want to reformulate amendment 47 and add a minimis provision.Water transfers are already included in the controls, but an explicit mention makes the text clearer.This part of amendments 49 and 87 can therefore be approved.However, it is not necessary to set as a condition that all measures to orient the request be taken.The proposal already establishes that the capture of water must be made in accordance with an ecological use of a hydrographic basin.These parts of amendments 49 and 87 cannot therefore be accepted.The Commission approves amendment 76 which implies that radioactive substances are explicitly included in the proposal.In summary, the Commission can adopt 72 entire amendments, in part or in their principle.The following amendments cannot be accepted: 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 71, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 90, 91, 95, 97, 98, 100, 103, 106.I pleasurely welcome the efforts made by the Parliament in order to solve the problems for which the advice of the council differs.Significant progress has been made and the constructive tone of discussions creates an excellent working climate for future negotiations.The number of obstacles remains identical, but I am convinced that at the rate in which the work of legislation continues, we will achieve our common objectives in order to develop a water policy which we can be proud of.A firm decision -making on the part of the Parliament will largely contribute to the implementation of an ambitious European water policy for the next three decades.I would like to hear the point of view of the commissioner on amendment 45.	fr
"Now, and I would like to say that in the direction of the Netherlands, the negotiations about it took place in an earlier stage.The result is an increase of 30 %, so we are not unhappy about it.It is of course always better, and I will always advocate making more money available and a little faster.But I think this program offers good chances for many programs.I would like to emphasize that culture is not only promoted from this fund.Culture not only falls into the culture department, but also in many other areas.There are also considerable financial resources available for culture in the structural funds.We also have to keep this in mind and take into account accordingly.Fortunately, I am sitting in the committee of regional policy, transport and tourism and will therefore make sure that this is also due.We have decided to agree that the budget is sufficient, because if it is not approved, this is enough for the citizens.I always supported the rapporteur in it.I still think it is necessary, and he says again and again that there is a change in the co -decision procedure at the upcoming government conference, then there must be no principle of unanimity.We are quite positive about the numerous improvements that have been made.No more mega projects, space for cultural networks, great attention to promoting reading, translation, translation services that are certainly important for the smaller language areas.I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and Ms. Reding on ""Kultur 2000"".All I have to do is say: Now we are going to work.Mrs. President, actually all the previous speakers have already taken away the words.In my opinion, there is agreement among the political parliamentary groups and the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, which I belong to.I too will vote for the joint draft of a decision by the Council and the European Parliament.Not because our delegation as well as our rapporteur and chairman, Mr. Gargani, had not done an excellent job - you have made a lot of effort - not because I think that I think that I thought that I thought that it is available - but because of the negative and unacceptable position of the council within the scope available to her.It's a shame!This amount, 167 million euros for such a long period of time, is a shame for the European Union!It's really sad: In the meantime, we are now forced to humiliate theater groups, young musicians, forward -looking art projects and writers to be humiliating, yes, to humiliate them by delighting and rejecting thirty.Of course, this arouses the feeling in these people that Europe is strange to the efforts of cultural creativeism, dismissive, dismissive, even straight away, for which the European Union should actually be committed - because our path is not just the euro, is not just the extension, are not just geostrategic considerations.Our task is to lead the matter of European unification to cultural flower."	de
"The communication of the Commission that we examine today and which constituted the basis of discussion from which the Council has spoken in November reflects in a balanced manner in which we can improve the discussion, to expand our knowledge of the challenges that the Member States will face in matters of social policy in the coming years, during which we will witness the aging of the populations as well as to the consequences of the enlargement.Many member states are already experiencing serious social problems today and are faced with significant social spending at the level of their public budgets.If reforms are not introduced, we risk eroding the economic basis on which social policy is based;However, a strong and competitive economy is the best guarantee of good quality social security.We are therefore delighted that these themes are on the agenda.The expression ""social convergence"" is often used during discussions relating to the coordination of social policy within the EU.As a liberal deputies, the concept of social convergence is a concept that we accept insofar as the EU is a question of establishing large common objectives that states must endeavor to achieve through their national social policy.It is therefore not a harmonization, but of common objectives.It is a fact that the EU member states organize their social policy in different ways.We have different traditions, different cultures and despite many points of resemblance, the character of social problems and their magnitude also differ from country to country.This is why it is important to underline the fact that social policy represents a national prerogative.National policy is obviously subject to a certain number of common managers, whether minimum social rights established by the treaty, the guarantee of free movement of workers without losing their social rights, the coordination of economies as well as economic cooperation.Coordination and cooperation are elements that must be added, but convergence must be based on objectives and not on means.I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Jan Andersson, for the very constructive efforts he has made with a view to trying to reconcile different points of view and thus guarantee support for his report.I will vote for his report, but there are a few points that are not entirely for my taste.I do not agree with the point which requests that the Commission intervenes against what is called unfair competition between social and tax systems if such intervention is intended to curb innovations, the evolution and improvement of the efficiency of our social systems or if it aims to prevent a reduction in the tax pressure too high in many Member States.I am skeptical about the detailed regulations which could result from the intervention of the Commission with regard to the extent and quality of child care plans and the care to be provided to the elderly and I am skeptical about the value of a common threshold of poverty."	fr
The question is of great importance, and I would like to know, since one can speak of baby fraud whether the Lord will work for it so that these funds will not be withheld from the Andalusians so that the funds that the European Union pays on Andalusia based on the registration register are taken into account these four hundred thousand children, which Aznar is not interested in giving them schools and services.Ms. MP!Please think about it - please do not understand this as a warning - that we treat strictly communal topics.I know that these are very important topics in Spain and there are different perspectives ... I tell the Lord Commissioner that Aznar is the President of the Spanish government.Would you answer the request?As I found, Mrs. MP, they have a strong voice, and I hope that it was loud enough to have been heard in Madrid.However, it is clear to me that your words did not address me directly.I answered them.It is due to me that the structural funds and especially those for goal 1 come where they are needed.There are criteria that have to be observed and we know roughly what every European region should or could.Regardless of this, I have to - and this is not an excuse, but I have to address the general structural fund regulation - speak to the national authorities of every country and with the government of every country.It is up to them to split the funds as objectively and as fairly as possible.I have to find out that first, so I told you that I can't answer today.Since I have no information, I wrote to the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance on December 14th.I am slowly becoming impatient that I have not yet received an answer, but I will send them to them as soon as I have them in my hands.I regret that the Lord commissioner is once again drawn into a pointed and passionate discussion in this case.In Spain - I would like to remember all of this - we are in the election campaign, there are no twenty -five days until the elections.It is a consolation for the Lord Commissioner that these elections will take place in twenty -five days, which is why he probably does not be asked for inquiries of this kind.But I think it is important to say that Andalusia will receive 50 % more in the common framework and that Spain also holds a record with regard to the use of the structural funds, which means that the distribution is strictly based on the implementation provisions and is handled by the regional development plans and the various framework of the community support.Finally, I would like to make a specific request to the Lord: does he consider a change in the implementation regulations for the structural funds necessary, or does he consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable?I find this debate very revealing.It is clear to me that there is a dimension that is not exclusively common in nature.Regardless of this, one has to put up with the fact that elections are constantly taking place in all countries of the Union.	de
Now we are asked to provide the legal basis for such a surveillance.It is the combination of these two documents that you should see.The requirements provide that the authorities have access to the facilities of all providers of services, i.e. on telephones, mobile phones, internet, etc., and with the current extremely careless design, the abuse is open to the door and gate.I would also like to ask: Provided that the requirements are provided that the police have access to all providers of services without exception, does this also include the internal parliamentary service?Do we accept regulations here that allow the police to access our own systems for particularly low motives?In addition, there is no threshold for serious offenses in this proposal.That opens it far for abuse.As in turn, the reverse of the burden of proof, something that is considered recognized in international, fundamental law, the presumption of innocence is essential.This is not guaranteed.Neither the preamble nor the main text take into account the right to defense, a basic principle of international fundamental rights.This question is extremely serious.We are very concerned about the direction that we strike here without proper public debate in the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the inclusion of organizations for civil freedoms from all over Europe, which are extremely worried about these developments.Mr. President, I am neither a member of the committee for the freedoms and rights of citizens, justice and internal affairs nor a lawyer, but like almost all colleagues, I can understand how necessary it is that in addition to the uniform economic area in Europe there is also a corresponding uniform space of law, freedom and security.In this respect, questions of justitial cooperation in criminal matters are very important.What did I make clear to me when reading the corresponding texts?I have understood that in view of all the contradictions, the contrary opinion about what Europe is now, in view of the diversity of the judicial systems, which not only creates confusion and inefficiency, but also leads to a real dangerous situations, is risky to rely on the regulations of the council.This applies, for example, to Article 18, which many colleagues have also pointed out and, according to which every country, every large country, if they want, can monitor every country that has the technical possibilities of the telecommunications traffic of another country without the approval of the affected country.In my opinion, the right committee and the rapporteur DI Pietro submitted an extremely interesting report.Unfortunately, Mr. Di Pietro was unable to explain the well -founded reason in his five -minute and therefore really short speaking time here.In any case, it is about the protection of the rights of both the countries and the accused and the citizens.In my opinion, this approach should be deepened and braver.However, I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that in this context the criminal law is setting or even schizophrenic framework conditions.A young person, a student or student who smokes a hashish cigarette is drawn up pedagogically in one country.	de
Perhaps it is no coincidence that by the conservatives there is no one now here because what has been defended here as freedom of the market has nothing to do with the worthy principles of the market social economy that have provided us with so much well -being in Western Europe during the past decades.Well, if we follow the way - and this is ideology - to declare financial markets as sacrosanct and even affirm that any intervention in the functioning of these markets is opposed to progress and economic growth, we will be on the wrong way and this can adopt really dangerous dimensions.The owners of cash assets are currently accumulating gigantic heritage that in turn urges to be reinvested.We are faced with an Asset inflation of world magnitude.In this way, in financial markets, speculative bubbles originate that cause increasing economic instability, which in turn endangers the entire economy.It is precisely the small and medium enterprises and many workers who suffer from the consequences.It is possible to oppose this.The minimum that should be done for this is to finally carry out some thorough studies on the subject, not only by the Commission but also of renowned economic institutes throughout Europe.This is also feasible.And finally, the wolf should not be taken to take care of the sheep.It is not true that Tobin Tax is not technically viable.It is possible in the era of computers.It cannot be ignored that fiscal oasis are often nothing other than hard -to -line memoras of large European banks here.In summary: we cannot allow real capital and financial capital to move away both among themselves, otherwise, we will be faced with a situation that we have already lived several times in the last century in this continent and has led to large catastrophes.Mrs. President, distinguished colleagues, apply taxes on capital speculation, because this will not have unprecedented consequences.This tax would affect those who must be taxed: speculators.Who defends these speculators, while nurses and teachers pay very high taxes?Article 73 C of the European Union Treaty regulates the possibility of tax transaction.Those who oppose capital tax support tax evasion centers, tax havens, which total a total of 62. The Union should reach a fiscal agreement that, initially, could be signed by any country.The moderate Tobin tax would not cause major tax evasion problems.The statement that if everyone does not apply the tax is curious, nothing can be achieved in this field.The European Union was founded thanks to the thrust of some countries, and you can see what we have become today.Actually, the biggest problem is political: the capital is not wanted to tax, but to raise citizens' taxes.And it is that the capital tax would politicize the antidemocratic and powerful global finance system.	es
He described globalization as a positive process in which I agree with it.In my opinion, globalization has contributed to the fact that numerous countries that have previously been excluded from world trade have now been integrated into the world trade system, and as far as I know, not a single country has been worse off by world trade.In other words, such as Mr. Gasòliba I Böhm, I also consider globalization to be positive and believe that it has contributed to a new international division of labor, as has been sought by many for years.Second, Mr. Gasòliba I Böhm has not yet proven that it has not yet been proven that the exchange rates are stabilized by the Tobin tax.He is right in it.I am also not aware of any reasons, which is why the collection of a tax on speculative currency transactions should lead to stabilizing the exchange rates.In my opinion, these are two important comments, and that's why I repeated them here.Allow me to determine, Mrs. President, that none of the speakers established a connection between the Tobin tax and the functioning of the European Union this evening.We all know the Roman contracts: The four basic freedoms that are anchored in them are known to include free capital.Mrs. President, I can assure her parliament that in my daily work I also try to achieve the full integration of European financial markets with my agencies and my colleagues in order to largely facilitate and flexible capital.In other words, due to my office, I am against all measures that would make international capital difficult.You can then hardly expect this commissioner to agree to a tax that would affect international financial transactions.In my opinion, the Tobin tax is in contradiction to the Roman contracts, and this is an important theoretical objection that was not brought up by any of the speakers this evening.According to these very fundamental comments, there are now practical reservations against Tobin tax, as they were expressed by Mr. Karas, but also by other speakers.It was pointed out that the European Union - unfortunately, as I have to say, could not agree internally on certain tax measures.This proves how difficult this matter is.If we couldn't get any agreement internally, how should we then convince the other trading partners?That should be a tedious process.Mr. Jonckheer said this was one of the measures that could cause stabilization of the financial markets.However, this addresses a symptom while we should pursue the causes, and in my opinion it is better to combat the causes than to treat the symptoms, which is probably not possible at all and, as I said, certainly violates the Roman contracts.To remedy these causes, the situation in the countries concerned must be visualized.Can these countries boast of what is called good governance in English?Are there low inflation and low interest rates in these countries?Do the markets of the production factors, including the labor market, work flexibly?That is not always the case.So if we are looking for the reasons for the exchange rate stability, we have to focus mainly on the elements that are part of good governance.	de
The European Union voted against said proposal.The position of the European Union on the attitude to be adopted with China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed again in the General Affairs Council of March 21, 1999: absence of the Initiative of the European Union with respect to China or Copatrocinio of a resolution of China, vote of the European Union against the proposal of non -interference.It is not true that, if the resolution had been voted, the cohesion of the European Union would have been maintained.The United States of America presented a resolution project relative to China in the fifty sixth session of the Human Rights Commission and are pressing the European Union to subscribe it.This circumstance has caused living reactions by that country: Chinese authorities are making arrangements to the countries and institutions of the European Union in the sense that they refrain from supporting the initiative of the United States of America.That initiative is in debate at the Union, but a decision is not expected shortly.It is interesting to the European Union not to rule out any option as far as possible, in any case until after the meeting that will be held on February 25, 2000, in the field of European-China Union dialogue on human rights.In the light of the modifications in the composition of the Human Rights Commission, it is estimated that the vote on the proposal of non -interference will be tight.Therefore, it is important that this year the countries of the European Union also reach a consensus on the position to be adopted in relation to the possible vote of the resolution.In this context, it is important to record that the European Union is systematically opposed to China's requests that in the dialogue on human rights the presentation of a resolution in the Human Rights Commission in Geneva is automatically excluded.The European Union unequivocally considers that, even if it is a very valuable instrument for the exchange of views and to know the conditions of the other part, the dialogue should also give concrete results in the field and, if not, a resolution of the Human Rights Commission may be necessary, possibly as the dialogue continues.The European Union also systematically reaffirms to China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate instance to raise human rights issues and that, regardless of its decision to subscribe or not the initiative, this is, in any case, legitimate from that point of view.The next dialogue on human rights will be held on February 25 in Lisbon and, among other things, consists of seminars on legal issues and women's rights and the participation of representatives of the academic world and civil society is expected.The next Human Rights Seminar will be held by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000 and in the last round of the dialogue, in October 1999, the Chinese part accepted the proposal of the European Union of Technical Assistance to support the process of ratification of the International Pact of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the United Nations, signed by the Chinese Government.	es
I also want to briefly thank the various deputies for their interventions and to say that for the commission security is a priority in the field of transport.And as Honorable Simpson said very rightly, the trial can never be taken for granted, acquired or concluded.The increase in margins, the security guarantees in transport is a process that must continue to improve day after day.In this sense, I also want to briefly refer to the problems of the tunnels, mentioned by the honorable racks and SwoBoda.In the case of Austria, it is undoubtedly a very sensitive theme, which requires an effort to see how to increase its safety.In one of the serious accidents that occurred recently, the transported goods were not in itself dangerous.The margarine and a few kilo of paint which, in principle, did not involve risks, caused an authentic catastrophe.It is therefore necessary to consider how it is possible to further perfect the criteria to ensure maximum safety.Finally, I repeat that we must consider security in all types of transport.This week we will keep here a debate on the safety of maritime transport, following the catastrophe of Erika, and during this year we will have to discuss the objectives regarding air transport safety.But, honorable deputies, security is a priority objective of the Commission.As I will have the opportunity to declare during the debate on Erika, we do not expect a catastrophe to devote ourselves to the examination of the issue of security, but we work on it regardless of these events, which do nothing but demonstrate how urgent it is to give an effective response to this type of problems.I thank once again all those who intervened, and in particular the supervisor Koch.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, at 12.00.Transport of dangerous goods on the road, the agenda bears the report (A5-0104/1999) presented by the honorable Koch on behalf of the Commission for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the proposal of directive of the European Parliament and of the Council [com (1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083 (COD)] which modifies the Directive 94/55/EC.legislation of the Member States relating to the transport of dangerous goods on the road.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, the directive that entered into force on January 1, 1997 concerning the rapprochement of the legislation of the Member States relating to the transport of dangerous goods on the road contains some transitional rules whose validity is completed and depends on the conclusion of some norms of standardization by the CEN, the European normalization committee.The delays in the works of the CEN have led to problems in the application of the aforementioned directive.In particular, the attachments could not be adapted to the most recent developments in the technological and industrial sector.This is in my opinion deplorable and forces us to intervene to remedy other people's defaults.I therefore accept the proposal to modify Directive 94/55/EC under discussion.A non -intervention by the European Union would oblige Member States to modify their national legislative provisions for a short period, or until the conclusion of the works of the CEN, which would entail unnecessary costs and uncertainties.	it
Mr. President, I thank colleague Langen - although he himself is not present - for the work he did to get the program through both parliament and the council.The project was long and difficult.The study to record the use of renewable energy sources must continue to receive great weight in the future.Although the new guideline contains a lot of positive things, it also has defects.An example of this is the use of peat.Peat must not be classified in the same group as fossil fuels.If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non -fossil fuels, his own class must be defined, especially in view of the environmental tax.Peat must not be measured with the same level as hard coal.The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution in order to end the depreciation of the Union's energy imports.Research also plays a particularly big role in relation to the next EU.The dependence on energy imports primarily affects Eastern European countries, whose economic structures still suffer from the dependence on Russian energy created during the Soviet period.The EU has to stick to the Kyoto climate agreement.We all worry about the environment and the future of our children.The proportion of renewable energy sources in total energy production must be increased, but in a reasonable manner.We must not forget that we can no longer build the main part of our energy generation on renewable energy sources for long.To do this, we need climate -friendly energy, nuclear energy.Mr President, for the Spe parliamentary group, I welcome it that we have come to a result in the mediation process for the Older II program.First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, the colleague Langen, for his really good work on this report.I would also like to thank the head of the delegation in the mediation committee, the colleague Provan.Because as Mr. Langen said it was really a hard fight in the mediation committee.But we can see today that the result of the mediation also clearly shows the manuscript of the European Parliament.Mr. Langen has pointed out that a number of content and demands of the parliament were taken over, and at the most important conflict point with the council, the financial resources of this multi -year program to promote renewable energy sources in the community, we have already been able to meet with which the council almost met.This is not satisfactory, I would like to say that very clearly.But we have received this compromise because it was important to us that this program can now be started really quickly.Because in the next few years the proportion of renewable energy sources in energy consumption should be doubled to at least 12 %.That is the declared goal of the European Union.The Altener program as the only EU program with the exclusive objective of the promotion of renewable energy sources is now really a key role.With this new five-year program, the actions from the Altener I program must be expanded.This includes, among other things, the deepening of the exchange of information and experience of actors in the area of ​​renewable energy sources, including the expansion of local, regional energy agencies, the development of new and the promotion of existing networks.These are just a few examples.	de
"First, improve the effectiveness of your development policy.As is known, in 1995 a global evaluation exercise of development policies was made and during the German presidency it was possible to present their conclusions.The main conclusions underline the need for a more coherent policy of the European Union and a general strategic vision of the European Union in relation to development problems.The aspects related to the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between the policies, of harmonization and simplification in the organizational framework in which the Cooperation Policy of the Union, the need to make the management of help and review, in particular, its intervention mechanisms, the need to strengthen the evaluation system and make the way in which the help process develops more efficient.A second aspect worth mentioning reinforces the need for greater complementarity between the European Union and the policies of the Member States.It is known that an important part of the aid is in charge of national policies of the Member States, not always complementary and not always coordinated;Much of the waste or the inefficiency of aid from the European Union is due precisely to that inability to coordinate and complementarity between what each Member State is doing and what the European Union institutions are proposed or do.From our point of view, it is also absolutely indispensable that as soon as possible we can contribute to strengthening mechanisms of complementarity and coordination between the policies applied by the Member States and those of the European Union.Third aspect worthy of relief: strengthening and coherence of its policies, the issue of debate proposed today.In the first place, we all have the idea that it is not enough to improve the conditions of aid and that it is necessary to better articulate other policies of the European Union so that the objectives of development can be achieved not only by the way of help and assistance, but also and especially through a more integrated vision of the different policies that contribute to its consequences.As is known, in June 1997, a resolution of the Council was approved and the Commission remained to present evaluation reports: the first one, in which some aspects of policy coordination are already established, in particular in the sphere of the construction of peace, food security, fishing and migrations, it was communicated to the Council in May 1999. But, as it is also known, a communication of the commission on coherence is expected.development"".It is natural that in the coming months, still during the Portuguese presidency, this debate can be enriched in the light of the contributions that the Commission proposes to submit in that regard.The coherence of policies will always be - it is evident - limited and it is natural that some contradiction between policies is also an element of balance and weighting between contradictory and conflicting interests that move in the space of the Union and that only in that way it is also possible to regulate some contradiction between policies."	es
"However, today I want to talk about prevention.In the Gulf region a new war conflict is being prepared.The Iraqi government, as you know, has refused to fulfill the 1284 resolution of the United Nations, and this negative will predictably mean, within the next six or seven weeks, the denial of the input visas to the commission that must control the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.In that case, the United States government and the British Majesty government have clearly understood that they are determined to resort to military measures.My visit to Iraq and meetings with the leaders and personalities of the Iraqi Administration, in particular with Mr. Tarek Aziz, have convinced me that there really is a possibility of convincing the Iraqi government to collaborate in the application of resolution 1284. However, it is necessary that the authorities responsible for the western countries clearThe embargo will lift and that trade relations can be normalized.I would like to know what Europe and you, Mr. Solana, or what you intend to do in the next future, to move this war threat that, today, can be prevented: tomorrow it could be too late.In this context, I would also like to know if it is not possible to do something to induce the Iraqi government to take a humanitarian step, that is, to provide information about the 615 missing Kuwait or to free them in case they were under their control.Mr. President, Mr. Upper Representative, Lord Commissioner, we have all observed the particularly moderate and almost conciliatory reaction of the international community in general, and the European Union, especially, on the war in Chechnya.Now, what has happened and what still happens in Chehenia resembles a genocide.If not, how can the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400,000 inhabitants be described, the constant and excessive bombardment of localities, neighborhoods, where it was, mixture perhaps with some checkpoints, the entire civil society?How should we qualify the sinister filtration fields, assimilable to concentration fields, where the population suffers from the worst humiliations and where healthy men, aged 15 to 65, rarely come out alive?How can violations, looting, volunteer fires, deportations, called ""cleaning"", which remember the worst episodes of the European Middle Ages?And what can be said about the hard situation that Russian and international journalists are going through, as well as expulsion, from the places where the killings, humanitarian organizations and all international research commissions occur?If that is the Real Politik, if we do not really have media, then, Mr. Alto Representative of the PESC, Mr. Commissioner, I address both: let's use the means we have, that is, the programs of help to Russia."	es
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have before them a tremendous challenge and in the Eldr group we are concerned that there is a weakening in the impulse of competition policy both in the examination of mergers and in the supervision of restrictive methods.Delegating in the national authorities is very good, but we would like to underline what Mr. Von Wogou has said in his report on the need for periodic supervision of the national authorities to ensure that there is no reduction by the European part and we would like to ask in particular the Monti Commissioner to reassure us, in the sense that there will be random checks in this regard.Mr. President, in the small time I have, I want to support the work done by all the speakers and share many of the things that have been said here, particularly by my partner Jonckheer, criticizing the excessive grouping of data and the need for transparency and socio -economic balance of the aid.I also share the criticism that there has been no emphasis on the development of article 82, especially when we can attend abusive behaviors in a context of market concentration.I want to formulate, as deputy of the Basque Country, my total support for the measures to apply due market competition.I say it in case any doubt for the criticisms that we have directed to the Commission, in general, and Mr. Monti, in particular, for their persecution of incentives to Basque companies and for the fact of considering them as state aid.Our discrepancy subsists to the extent that the Commission still does not understand the character of the general and co -responsibility system of our concert, which make our Basque fiscal norms have the same nature, foundation and purpose that the norms of the states of the Union, and that are generally applied to all taxpayers who, by virtue of the connection points, are subject to them.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner.Yes, we certainly need competition.We need to compete in the field of maximum reduction in unemployment, the improvement of health care, social justice, demanding social norms and also-the previous ones are criteria of political-economic competitiveness-we also need to compete, naturally, in the business economic sphere: highest quality of products, comparison of market access conditions for all companies, offer of products respectful of the environment.That is, we must be able to combine the necessary criteria of political-economic competitiveness with the criteria of the business economy.Sometimes I have the impression that, unlike what happened in my country-in GDR-, where it prevailed above all competitiveness from the political-economic point of view, without paying attention to business competitiveness, now it becomes very often the opposite and society thinks almost exclusively in terms of the business economy.I say it from my entrepreneur position absolutely interested in this aspect.But a system cannot work like this.The only possible way is a combined approach.	es
"In the postal sector, the first phase is already started, suppliers of the universal service having engaged in a modernization process.Rather than the process of liberalization of the sector, it is new technologies and logistics that constitute the essential factors influencing employment.With regard to the availability of studies, point raised by Mr. Staes and other deputies, copies of each of these studies were sent to Parliament in September 1999. They are all available on the Commission's website since August 1999 and the Commission is willing to provide a copy to any interested person.Studies have been the subject of some criticisms, particularly on the part of postal public services.I am aware that all the studies started have experienced difficulties in collecting adequate data.This did not surprise us because the operators of the universal service do not always have detailed mail collection systems.Doesn't that say long on management capacity?No unique methodology allowing access to the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all parties.However, Mr. Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken are clear and precise enough to constitute the basis of the decision -making process.I finally come to three interventions on a subject that I am supposed to know better than postal services: competition.Mr. Purvis, I found that your remark on the call for tenders, provocative on the methodological level, was interesting and was certainly worth explored.Mr. Medina Ortega, I am just as convinced as you that we will have to be even more vigilant after liberalization, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give birth, for lack of control of concentrations, to private operators.This applies both to the postal sector and other sectors.If I can give you an example of this type of vigilance, I will quote the case of the ""Deutsche Post"" for which the Commission began, following complaints and a legal action, an official procedure for examining state aid in July.We have just received the German government's response to the observations issued.The procedure for examining state aid covers the issue of cross subsidies between monopolistic mail services and commercial messaging activities as well as the financing of recent and numerous acquisitions of the ""Deutsche Post"".I will not enter into details because of the lack of time but it may illustrate, among other things, the fact that the Commission does not stop its work with the progress of liberalization.In a sense, this is where his work begins.Finally, it goes without saying, Mr. Radwan, that limits must be put in competition and these limits exist.If we consider in particular the question of competition and services of general interest, when a Member State defines a public service mission, it is important to quantify the costs generated by this mission and state aid which compensates for these costs are certainly not a violation of competition.I do not quite agree with the terms you used, Mr. Radwan, saying that it was time to take into account the needs of citizens rather than exclusively the need for competition."	fr
Mr. President, honorable colleagues, nine million vehicles are sent to scrapping and disposal every year in Europe.Although they are no longer able to circulate, the aforementioned nine million vehicles have the characteristic of being marketed and transported also beyond the boundaries, not only of intra -community ones, but also of non -EU ones.Therefore in principle it is correct that the European Union Sancisca of the common norms regarding the recycling and treatment of these nine million vehicles.In our opinion, the Directive presents some weaknesses that Parliament wishes to touch up, thus preparing a tool that actually indicates the way to be taken for the future.For this reason, numerous amendments have been forwarded.I believe that the scope of this directive pushes too much.Do not judge that period vehicles are included in the directive.I don't even think that motorcycles should be included in this directive, because in this sector a culture of recycling is rooted such as to make a European directive superfluous.Also as regards special vehicles, I do not consider it appropriate to aim for a very high recycling percentage.For special vehicles such as ambulances I would prefer a high recovery rate.This is my main concern in this field.In my opinion, the Directive corrects the obligation to prove how a vehicle intended for disposal is treated in Europe.In this case we can transpose the proposals of the Commission.Member States mean that special collection centers are established that empty the liquids contained in vehicles, for example by disposing of more than 32 million exhausted oils, removing the brake fluid, etc.An important aspect treated in the directive is represented by the question inherent in the destination to be given to the parts used and the products of the scrapping.It is not possible to ignore the fact that the percentage constitutes an important element, but not the only one, of recycling, recovery and anything else.In fact, it should not be forgotten that, as regards the mobility of a vehicle, 80 percent of environmental pollution depends on its circulation, 1 percent on reuse and 19 percent on the construction.Therefore the percentages do not represent the only parameter to be applied in relation to environmental compatibility, but are only one of the many parameters to keep in mind.I am of the opinion that we need clear objectives.But the percentages must not become a goal in itself;We must realize the importance of the global perspective connected to the environmental pollution caused by a vehicle.I prefer to think that from a vehicle that today weighs 1,400 kilos and on average it runs 200,000 kilometers we will go to a car in the future that will weigh only 1,000 kilos, but will continue to be able to travel 200,000 kilometers.In this way, for 200,000 kilometers, 400 kilos would still be transported.This is the real progress in terms of environmental policy, because it will lead to a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions and, if I correctly understood the Kyoto protocol, it is the essential point.For this reason, we believe that the vehicles for whose realization in the future will be used optimally and demonstrable to construction methods that reduce their weight will produce less CO2 and therefore a special preference must be assigned as regards the percentage of incineration.It is not up to the individual Member States, but to you, lady commissioner, together with your staff, it is up to decide whether to such light vehicles - many also speak of three -liter vehicles - a special preference must be attributed.	it
This is also characteristic of American society, which itself learns little about it.The Americans are rightly outraged by war and genocides in other parts of the world, but are wrongly silent about the genocide in their own country.Today, the Dineh Indians face the last struggle for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, their right to their own way of life.You are only a few, but your opponent is an economic power.Mr. President, revered Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!I agree with the explanations of my previous speakers, but I would like to highlight a few more things.The Dineh are among the North American Navajo Indians.They are excluded from society and have been fighting for survival for decades.They have been living under miserable conditions for years.These poor circumstances force them to bend against their will to the financial and economic pressure of the coal industry.The resettlement law issued in 1974, which includes the redistribution of the territory of the Navajo Reserve, allows the resettlement of the population groups.These resettles are of course unacceptable, since human rights are violated in economic, social and cultural terms.The Dineh Indians are pushed back and forth like chess figures and not only lose their history and the extremely important soil - the bottom of their ancestors - but they also have no view of finding work and sources of income.The resettlement law was enforced in the congress by a group that represented the coal industry.The congress has never thought about where the people who lived in the area should or how the relocation would affect their lives.The population had no say.This is almost human trafficking.The relocation was carried out and the Dineh was implemented in an uranium -contaminated area.After breaking a dam in New Mexico in 1979 and the release of 370,000 cubic meters of radioactive water and 1 100 tons of pure uranium, this place is one of the most contaminated areas in the world.The government of the United States, the coal industry and we all have to face our responsibility and ensure an acceptable alternative: either the soil is decontaminated, or the Dineh Indians are assigned a place worth living, and every necessary support is provided for psychological, social, cultural and financial level.The rights of the Indians must finally be observed.Therefore, we ask to vote for this decision: We must not be intimidated by American interests in Europe that are asserted by financial, religious and industrial groups.So we best send an urban ratio to the United States!President!In terms of human rights, there is of course a lot to be criticized in Chechnya.According to human rights organizations, Russian soldiers have killed civilians, old women and men, in Grosny, apparently even executed.Civilians are said to have been burned alive in protective cellars.We insist that these human rights violations are examined.Contrary to the promise, the violations of human rights committed in Alfanjurt, for example, were still not examined.International government organizations and non -governmental organizations must be given access to the area.The Council General Affairs of the Union decided on December 6, 1999 to send representatives of the Member States to Inguschetia in order to examine the humanitarian situation, and I am, to say the least, curious about what comes out.	de
"However, on a structural and general level, all of us, regardless of the place where we find ourselves, from the social class, from the race, from religion, within the domestic walls as at work, in any area of ​​society we are subject to man - with some individual exceptions, as it is perhaps right to clarify.In my country, Sweden, in recent years several political parties have spontaneously decided to introduce a share of places to be allocated to women in the assembly bodies.This has translated into an increase in the presence of women in the decision -making process, and in turn created space to conduct further research.What happens when a greater number of women takes part actively, and on a foot of equal, in the decision -making process?The conclusion that emerged so far is that this has led to a modification of political priorities, and a modification of political priorities naturally also involves a change in the decision -making types.When it comes to the altitude based on the two sexes, the word ""competence"" is always automatically appointed.But the interesting thing is however that rarely the competence requirements are defined.It would seem that, today as yesterday, men systematically possess even the most indefinite skills.In short, being a man would be synonymous with having greater competence.And such a vision seems to me to prove the high degree of incompetence that characterizes many of those who make decisions at present.Within this assembly, this year we have already made the request to make an international holiday on March 8.Waiting for this to become reality, I take this opportunity to wish all success to all socialist women in the Women 's world marches that will start with the International Women's Day this year.It is a worldwide initiative, concentrated on violence against women and female poverty in the whole world.In conclusion, I want to say, how Commissioner Patten in conclusion of the discussion held a few indeed, that the ideal policeman would be a color grandmother.We have no such policemen, yet they would exist!Mr. President, the role of women in politics is an important question that deserves something better than the politically correct relaunch to which we witness.There are probably few women engaged in politics, although it is not said that this is attributable only to the dominance of men in the party systems.In France, 95 percent of the elect are municipal councilors, whose vast majority is not affiliated to any party.In institutions at the level of the department, the first party of France is that of non -members, both on the right and on the left.To get on the local councilor, just want to want it.Now, on the inclusion they offer these mandates often depends on national liability access.The UEN group warms up a fair representation of men and women within the organs of the European Union.That's why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, which it expresses itself in favor of women or alleged social minorities.The policy of minorities, neglecting the deep unity of the human family to establish superficial divisions, seriously threatens the cohesion of the social body and the balance of our democratic model."	it
"Inquiry No. 3 of (H-0027/00): Concern: Charge of NATO Before the International War Criminal Tribunal Human Rights Organizations, such as ""Human Rights Watch"" (Observatory for Human Rights) in the USA, have already collected considerable stress material against NATO in connection with the air raids in Kosovo and Serbiato submit to the Haag.On the basis of this information, some of which have already been presented to the court mentioned above, NATO is accused of serious violations of international humanitarian law and intentional killings.Is the advice of the opinion that such allegations have to be left to the judgment of the International War Criminal Tribunal in order to be subject to a detailed judicial investigation?In the event of a judicial investigation of the allegations against NATO, the council intends to proceed with the general secretary/high representative of the common foreign and security policy, who held the office of NATO general secretary during the decisive period of time?Is there a procedure to give it from his tasks until the allegations have been examined in court?President!The question of Mr Alexandros Alavanos stimulates general considerations.The Council has already stated that the application of strict measures taken by NATO was necessary and justified in order to counter extremist and irresponsible actions, which represented a clear violation of the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.I understand that NATO's approach and the legality can be different.Everyone is free to represent such points of view.In my homeland, the individual parliamentary factions represented different opinions.Things were like that and no different.In any case, there is the clear point of view of the council in that the air strikes carried out by the organization of the North Atlantic Pact in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with the aim of ending the human disaster caused by the Belgrade regime in Kosovo.This goal was expressed formally and comprehensively by the point of view of the ""General Affairs"" Council on April 8 in Luxembourg.These measures of NATO, that must be said, were not taken lightly, but as a last remedy, when it became clear that the possibilities of a negotiating solution were exhausted and that the Belgraders' authorities concentrated their armed forces in order to drive away the Kosovo albanium from their homeland.The MP has surely learned that the recent visit to NATO when she recently visited NATO, the International Tribunal was obliged to investigate all charges, including those who were raised against NATO, especially Canadian pacifist groups.This mandatory examination takes place to the extent that these charges are raised.In any case, I have an explanation of the woman's indictment with me, in which she says that there is currently no investigation against NATO from the office of the prosecutor of the International War Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and that there is no formal examination procedure on NATO's procedure in the Kosovo conflict.All information that has been received in the past six months from both individuals and groups to apply for an investigation of the NATO actions during the Kosovo conflict were registered by the prosecutor.The prosecutor will of course examine all other information and, in due course, inform you whether there is an opportunity to act."	de
"Tomorrow it's about a few points.First, we know that the transport of people and goods with the ship is the most environmentally friendly in relation to other transport types.At the same time, we know that the ships contribute to the pollution of the oceans through garbage, load residues and oil sludge.The fuel for ships is once heavy oil, and we know that 1 % to 3 % of this heavy oil remains as an oil sludge, and this is classically disposed of in the sea.I think we agree that ships have to dispose of garbage and residues in the ports.And from this follows - and there can actually be no other logic: The top priority for clean seas is that illegal disposal on the high seas is no longer allowed to be worthwhile.That's what it's about, and the majority we debated here.In January we had a very detailed debate about the consequences of ""Erika"" with you, Ms. Commissioner.We have collected all the points for ship safety and clean seas.And also with this guideline on port access systems for load residues, the question is how we get the seas cleaner.Just for information: We know that 70,000 m3 are disposed of in the North Sea alone in the North Sea in an illegal way, and we know the other way round that a maximum of 5 % to 10 % of the ships are now going properly, namely to dispose of their trash in the ports.This scandal is also not acceptable from the point of view of the council.The Council also says that all ports have to hold up the appropriate harbor access systems and have to be equipped with it.The conflict is ultimately about the question: How is paid?In its first reading, the parliament with a large majority said that it must be a significant contribution to the ships, namely at least 90 %.And that is the difference to the council that tells us that it must be a contribution.But a contribution can only be half a euro, and in this case God knows too little.Then nothing changes.There is no economic pressure for the ships to behave accordingly.A disposal flat rate for all ships, regardless of the actual use of the disposal facilities, is necessary, that is, the economic incentive for disposal at sea must be omitted, which-as it was already explained here-in the Baltic Sea-with the Helmkom Agreement, with the no-special feet system.What works there must also work for the remaining European seas, because it is not just about the environment, it is about clean water, it goes up to tourism, and - what is crucial - in addition to the environmental question, it is also about competition neutrality.The ships in the ports must all be able to comply with the same conditions, and only if Parliament, Council and Commission create these conditions together is this neutrality of competition for the ports and ships.I think it's also about the credibility of the Union and especially parliament.I think people are tired of experiencing disaster hypocrisy from Europe and the ministers, as we saw it in ""Erika""."	de
"There were examples in Spain: Michelin, ABB-Alstom, and there are examples in Italy that my colleagues will name.There is also another hidden formula of dismissal, and in Spain, for example, it is practiced by the ERICSSON company under the name ""outsourcing"" (precise words are avoided, such as the word ""release"").The outsourcing of services means commissioning services for contract companies, which means that stable and fixed jobs are canceled at any time, without union and social rights.In reality, this is another veiled form of discharge.Mr. Commissioner!If the European institutions believe in what they say about full employment, they have to take up clear measures: the guidelines to ensure the participation of the employees in these negotiations, reduce the directive on mass layoffs, to reduce working hours, bind the European subsidies to maintain jobs and bind the social and labor law clauses into the international benefits subordinate to the European Unionto record.Mr President, once again this parliament has to deal with the restructuring of companies in Europe.Once again, the workers are at risk of loss of their workplace.This time it is about Goodyear's employees in Cisterna di Latina.As already mentioned, around 600 employees and just as many families who could be robbed in a month of their only source of income are affected.Despite their accommodation and professionalism, thanks to whom the company in Cisterna is one of the most productive in Europe, these workers threaten the risk of being emitted from the production cycle, while the Goodyear company, after it has been received for years, can close the goals and completely unhindered.I really think that is unfair: unfair to the employees of the branch in Cisterna and unfair to all those citizens in Italy and the Union, which, albeit indirectly, have enabled taxear to enjoy this state aid.The European Commission and the Council must finally fully commit themselves to their responsibility, both in terms of acceptance of the common point of view regarding the information and hearing of the entrepreneurs and as far as the community grants and state subsidies are concerned, which are only to be granted to the conclusion of long -term agreements for the preservation of jobs.Today we ask the Commission to protect employees from the Goodyear branch in Cisterna and therefore exert every conceivable pressure on the company so that there is an agreement as soon as possible to ensure the continued existence and the further operation of the branch in Cistern.Finally, I would like to point out that Mr. President and Mr. Commissioner, that the time really urges and therefore all the measures that are considered - including those already mentioned by the Commissioner in his introductory words - must be taken immediately and in time.President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!The European companies, if they continue to remain existence, undoubtedly want to adapt structurally in order to be able to better counter the new challenges.Today's economic background is quite aware of it, because the aim of the intended restructuring is to rationalize corporate management."	de
"If we believe in the principle of equal representation between women and men in decision -making, we must assume the necessary commitments that make this principle come true.Mr. President, at the Second International Socialist Conference of Women, held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was agreed that the essential claim, the female vote should be related to all other aspects of the woman's struggle and that, in addition, as stated in the resolution, ""Women's Day must have an international character and its preparation will have to be thorough.""It is also worth noting that Women's Day was later prohibited in all countries in which fascism and Nazism achieved power in the interwar period.The year 1910, the female vote was in the agenda.Today we take care of how women can participate in the decision -making process.Women do not constitute a homogeneous collective.Women belong to all social classes.Women have individual needs and interests.However, in a structural and generalized way, regardless of the place where we are, regardless of class and religion, at home or at work, in all segments of society, we are subject to man, although it should be added that there are some individual exceptions.In recent years in Sweden, my country, many political parties have voluntarily established female fees in the representations and work of political assemblies.This has meant an increase in the number of women in political decision making, which, in turn, has resulted in a new branch of research.What happens when more women participate actively and equally in political decision making?What has been demonstrated so far is that the day order has changed, and when it changes other decisions are also made.When talking about quota per sex, automatic reference is always made to suitability.The interesting thing is that suitability criteria are rarely defined.It often seems that men, today as yesterday, always have the most indefinite suitability.Being a man would therefore be equivalent to the possession of the greatest suitability.This perspective, in my opinion, is a proof of great incompetence by those who today make decisions.This year, in this assembly, we have requested that March 8 become an international holiday.While we hope this is completed, I want to take the opportunity to desire all socialist women in their Women 'S World Marches, which will begin in spring, International Women's Day.This is a worldwide activity that focuses on violence against women and the poverty of women in the world.Finally, as the commissioner Patten pointed out when the previous debate ended, I mean that the ideal police would be a color grandmother.We don't have it, but there are!"	es
"Europe, which has inappropriately suppressed the budget line ""Natural catastrophes for the benefit of the member countries"", must react, especially in the name of solidarity, but also in the name of its part of responsibility in this umpteenth black tide.In fact, citizens struggle to understand why Europe accepts what Americans refuse and why Europe, usually so ready to legislate in environmental matters, has so far glossy on maritime safety.Europe must legislate as soon as possible and shed light on this shipwreck.But, in the wait, the Commission must mobilize the European funds urgently to help their own companies, treat the wreck, clean the coast, increase the waste storage capacity, ensure their treatment or recycling, establish a research program on the recovery of oil from the sea.Finally, the Commission must reintroduce a hydonea budget line ""Natural catastrophes for the member countries"", allowing the regions affected to access the structural funds.What is the opinion of the Commission on these proposals?What decisions have already been taken and what matters to take the Commission?Which following the commission to the resolution voted on January 20, 2000 by the European Parliament?For the moment, we have not seen any measure concrete.Mr. President, echoing some colleagues, I would like to reiterate that the situation at two and a half months from the shipwreck remains particularly critical, revealing his gravity every day.The situation is dramatic from two points of view.Firstly, it is tragic at the environmental level.In fact, the wreck still contains sixteen thousand tons of heavy fuel that continues to escape and, beyond these losses, unfortunately last week we observed and accounted for thirty -five acts of ecological piracy, thirty -five chemical reclamation interventions, which unworthily add up to this absolutely catastrophic situation.The honorable De Palacio has focused for a long time on this problem and I believe that he has implemented without delay what is absolutely necessary today, that is, the establishment of a European maritime law through the proposal of directive on maritime transport of dangerous goods.Well, from this point of view, the honorable colleague will be able to count on the will of France to distinguish his presidency with the approval of regulations that go towards greater safety.The second shock - after the first, the environmental one - is manifested by an economic level and many colleagues today reiterated it.Mollluschiculture, fishing, oystericulture, pisciculture, were seriously affected because the damage of the storm were added to the black tide.Unfortunately, these activities have undergone terrible damage and, if on the one hand they must be reconstructed, on the other, perhaps more difficult task, they must regain the trust of consumers.Faced with this situation, the inhabitants of Brittany, Vandea, Chante and, passing to other sectors, the silviculters, await a sign from the European Union.We cannot put this legislature under the sign of the rapprochement to citizens and at the same time remain ""silent"", without concrete responses, in the face of phenomena of this kind and of this entity."	it
"Not only do we ask for more control or exclusively more control through Europol but for us it is valid here the motto of ""less is sometimes more"".If a large part of Europol employees is currently occupied above all with a legal data protection self -control and demands from 15 national parliaments arrive, this is much control and also ineffective.We want less control of control and more parliamentary control exercised by the European Parliament without wanting to hinder the work of the Europol.At the same time, we support the creation of a European Police Academy proposed in Tampere as a step in the right direction.Third: The extension of the rights of Parliament in this context.If the creation of a space of this type in which the union can also interfere with the fundamental rights of the citizens of the Union, it is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats while the elected representatives of Europe can only see from the outside the evolution as the rabbit observes the movements of the snake, then that space will not achieve the acceptance of the citizens.Therefore, it is urgent that they are granted to the Parliament Rights of Codecision in this regard and - as I have already indicated - the principle of democratic control is strengthened.We want a space for freedom, security and law for the citizens of Europe and not against them.Mr. President, estimated and estimated colleagues, I don't have to say anything else to the Council.The anterior speaker has already exposed it already using an appointment of the last meeting of the commission.Why do the Council have so many difficulties to cooperate with us regarding the construction of the space of security, freedom and law?This question occupies me continuously.I will try to contribute some light to this matter from my point of view.The construction of the space of security, freedom and law moves at the point of intersection between the constituent elements of national sovereignty.Police and justice are very clear elements of the status itself, that is, sensitive political fields of the member countries.The fusion of this point of intersection of these fields reaching the community of these policies, that is, to the delegation of powers of the national capital, of Lisbon, Berlin or Paris to Brussels means giving a plot of power.Naturally, one separates very, very hardly traditional forms, even if it is recognized that police cooperation is necessary and that we can only combat international crime at European level.It is necessary to extract consequences and say that then we have to communicate organizationally and legally the instruments.This assumes that the governments that must do so and that they see the need for it, at the same time recognize that they themselves lose power with the application process.They also have a European parliament that is complicated.But we have to solve it finally.Well, if we continue acting as until now with the experiences of last year, the following will happen: the debate on the security and rights of citizens will be marginalized in national parliaments due to the national and European half -half structure."	es
I have proof that this is possible.Most of you keep these debates in their respective circumscriptions, in their respective regions.According to the slightly more selfish vision of the Commission, I would like this institution to have a face in the eyes of the citizens, that the men and women who constitute it could meet as often as possible citizens.Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation for the commitment made by Commissioner Barnier to visit the regions to explain and to listen to what the citizens have to say.I would like to invite him to my Yorkshire region, a large European region that fully participates in the single market and is one of the main beneficiaries of European structural funds.It can come to visit us in the two offices that it covers as a commissioner.I wish to ask you how energetic the commission in this information campaign will be.In some Member States, the problem is not so much to provide information to an audience not very well informed, which certainly certainly important, but rather to contrast the disinformation spread by hyperactive anti-European anti-European organizations and movements.The commission must be very energetic in the responses to the comments it will receive during the campaign.Mr Corbett, thank you for your appreciation.I gladly accept your invitation and, if I understand well, she wants that during my visit to Yorkshire, I don't only talk about the reform of the European institutions, but also of structural funds.I am ready to fulfill this double task.I forgot to remember, among other things, how much I do to intervene, as I have already done, in front of the national parliaments, not only speaking here with their representatives, but by going to meet them on the spot.Ten days ago I went to Westminster.As you can see, Mr Corbett, I don't fear the difficulties.Next week I go to the Bundestag in Berlin.I have already spoken in front of the French Senate.So during all this debate, every time it will be possible for me, I will express myself directly in the face of national parliaments.Speaking of the dialogue with citizens, it is not a question of making propaganda or marketing and not even communication.I would like the dialogue to be truly such, and that after a short movie that objectively explains the stakes of the institutional reform, those who sit here in the stands can intervene and respond freely to the microphone.As I repeat, we intend to carry on this initiative of dialogue in punctual or structured cooperation with the Member States, and I sincerely hope that, with your support, the governments of the fifteen can associate, according to the method considered more appropriate and more adequate.Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the study group of Commissioner Barnier with the 700 Stagiaires, so he will have someone to discuss with.It is not so funny to discuss the intergovernmental conference and transparency alone.In relation to the intergovernmental conference, Commissioner Barnier, in his presentation to Parliament, said that social policy is not subject to majority vote, but on page 63 I read that the fight against discrimination, the right of circulation and residence - therefore the directives on the stay - the social security as a whole, the revision of Regulation no.1408 and the provisions in force on social policy - with some exceptions - will be subject to the rule of the qualified majority.	it
It is not up to you that it is the responsibility of deciding on this, it is up to us to do so.This too is linked to the new consciousness that this parliament of itself.I would like to discuss this with you, no more, no less.We can save ourselves any other foray, in any area whatsoever, and I respect you as a serious commissioner who wants to seriously fulfill his work.I beg you to respect us as deputies wanting to seriously pay theirs, of which the Tobin tax is also part.Madam President, it seems that there is a forgetfulness and that, in the list of resolutions deposited, which have just been mentioned by yourself, it has not been reported on the proposal for a compromise of compromise common to the PSE, the Liberals, the Gue, the Greens, and the Mrs. Kuntz and Mr. Cyeaux.Dear colleague, I take note of your declaration and the existence of this common resolution.If the presidency services confirm that it is well deposited, it goes without saying that it is taken into account.The debate is closed.The vote will take place Thursday at 12 noon.(The session is lifted at 8:14 p.m.) Adoption of the minutes of the previous meeting, Mr. President, I simply wanted to disseminate information: a terrorist attack took place this morning in Madrid.It was a car trapped.There was a dead man.I simply wanted, on behalf of my group, to condemn these terrorist acts once again.Thank you very much, Madame Fraga.We were indeed informed of this unfortunate event.Assassin terrorism unfortunately, once again, struck Spanish society;The presidency joins forces with a particular intensity with your intervention, you will understand it, since the presidency of this session is also Spanish.(The minutes are adopted) Resumption of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament, which had been interrupted on Friday January 21, 2000. The president, let me remember that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermès tragedy.Indeed, two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American plane from the NATO base located in Aviano, stretched, during a low altitude exercise - below the safety limits -, the cables of a cable car, causing the death of more than twenty European citizens.The families of the victims, who did not feel that justice has been made as soon as the responsible pilot did not incur the slightest sentence, at least expect from the United States, rapid economic compensation.I therefore invite the president of this assembly and the chairman of the commission to guarantee, alongside the American authorities, immediate compensation, to defend the rights of the families of the victims.Madam, thank you and I take note of your intervention.Agenda The agenda calls for the fixing of the work order.Following the request which was sent to me in this sense by several political groups and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents that we have just had, I suggest you include a debate of an hour and a half on a news problem, urgent and major importance, in accordance with article 50 of our rules, relating to the reaction of the Union with regard to government negotiations in Austria.	fr
There is no direct passage from Interreg II to Interreg III and this, in fact, involves uncertainties in programming and gaps in funding.It is a shame because in this way valid projects are certainly endangered.In the execution of Interreg, coordination and synchronization with the other financial instruments concerned must be guaranteed.This is particularly important to increase the efficiency of the funds used and however involves some problems.The difficulties are mainly due to the annual duration of the funds that are assigned on the basis of the projects, for example in the field of Phare, while the contributions provided in the Intergeg area have many years of duration and are assigned according to the measures adopted.In the future this will determine practical problems and I hope that all this does not prevent an satisfactory implementation of Interreg.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the leading community initiative has proven to be a valid tool to give impulse to innovative developments and pilot projects inside and starting from rural areas.Therefore it is certainly positive that this community initiative has been maintained and re -proposed in renewed form in the context of the leader+program.The new leader+ program is now implemented in the entire rural space of the European Union and this offers greater possibility of financing projects.It is certainly important to ensure the coordination between leader+ and other support interventions of the European Union, but it is equally important to ensure coordination with other forms of promotion at national level.On the one hand, it is necessary to avoid the fragmentation of support interventions and, on the other, to be able to exploit the synergistic effects.From this point of view, the goal of increasing the network connection between beneficiary areas of the leading program is certainly welcomed.The agricultural sector is one of the main axes in the rural space and must be able to participate in the leading initiative;The structural changes that invest agriculture can also be accompanied through the leading initiative, contributing to the creation of new jobs in the rural space.As part of the leader+ program, it is necessary to take into account all economic interconnections in the rural space and the possibilities to achieve the optimal result only through a common commitment.At this point you will have to move on to the leader's implementation phase.Operational programs must be approved as soon as possible by the Commission, that is, it is necessary to guarantee the practicability and efficiency in the treatment of financing requests and the utmost timeliness in the assignment of assignments.Five months are planned: too much in my opinion.We should shorten the times.Those who have elaborated and developed a project, in fact, are in a hurry to move on to the realization phase.Although he is fully satisfied with the new guise of the leading community initiative, I would like to draw attention to an aspect that is particularly close to my presentation: in its presentation, the EU Commission, asked for an observatory of the leading program+ without entering exactly the implementation of this proposal.In my opinion, the following issues ask themselves: who will work there?How will these people be selected?Above all: where will the necessary funds be found and where such an observatory should be based?They are of the opinion that the leader+ program no longer remains a penny to be allocated to further administrative expenses for tasks which, in itself, should be carried out by the Commission.	it
To justify this, we invoke the next enlargement of the Union.It surprises me because it is a bad interpretation.A federal and centralist EU which always directs the Member States is in fact less likely to expand.A flexible EU which focuses on less numerous, but essential areas that respects national differences and national democracies is more likely to encompass many more countries.To the point D of the proposal for resolution, a more effective and more transparent economic policy is required at the level of the EU.However, it is impossible to talk about this without speaking of the monetary union.In the current text, nothing is said of the big democratic and political problems linked to the monetary union and the central bank - it is not defensible.If you want to have a more democratic EU, you have to review the entire design of the UEM.The central bank must be placed under political control so that monetary policy can be led by a political objective such as the growth of employment or well-being;For this, the transparency of the central bank must be improved.The fixed and failed monetarism of the stability pact must be re-examined and rejected, if we want to be able to have a homogeneous policy which places the objective of well-being in the foreground.Article 56 of the Treaty, which prohibits any intervention in the free movement of capital, monetary speculation, must be deleted so that dangerous monetary speculations are refronted thanks to political control.Most EU countries today have governments dominated by Social Democrats.It is remarkable that none of them requires a change in the orientation of the monetary union, now that they have the possibility.The fact of declaring that the monetary union could constitute a counterweight to the globalization of capital also does not affect credibility.In resolution, the European Parliament is required to obtain greater power over the intergovernmental conference.However, it is important to emphasize that the intergovernmental conference is and must be a conference between the Member States.It is the Parliament of the Member States, or of the people in popular votes, which must direct the development of the treaty.It is therefore excluded that the European Parliament is given any formal influence in the negotiation or ratification process.Mr. President, the Constitutional Affairs Committee presented a substantially positive text for which I will vote, even if I myself introduced several enlargement amendments.However, what happened in recent days shows that all those who have expressed substantive criticism of how the expansion and revision of the treaties were organized were right.We cannot envisage a union of twenty-eight member states without facing the question of whether Europe shares certain principles, certain common values, if it is reduced to an economic zone of free exchange or if, on the contrary, it has a greater aspiration: to be a supranational union, according to aspects to be defined, also eager to draw a new path of civilization and democracy in the world.	fr
"The two proposals constitute a coherent whole.The first expands the range of tools with which a ""collective investment body in securities"" (OICVM) can operate.As already mentioned during the discussion, these bodies must be counted among the main actors on modern capital markets;Their presence guarantees a greater number of simple investors the possibility of operating on these markets in compliance with the principle of the distribution of risks and protected by adequate checks.Since diversified forms of investment are allowed, private investors can exploit all the advantages offered by new investment techniques.The second proposal expands the role that these important intermediation bodies can play on the capital market of the European Union as regards the development of the sector of investment funds.By allowing the creation of sectors and the performance of certain transfrontier level services, these bodies will benefit from the freedoms provided for by the Treaty of Rome, of which they have not been able to take advantage so far.The Commission appreciates many of the clarifications proposed by the Commission for economic and monetary problems and will implement most of the ideas advanced by it.The Commission will welcome the amendments - I use the last numbering - nn.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 relating to the first proposal and nn.23, 28 and 32 concerning the second, since they represent useful clarifications and improvements.Furthermore, judging ideas favorably - even if they must be properly formulated - contained in the amendments nos.1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20. Also support the concept of the maximum percentage of the risk of the counterparty at the basis of the amendments nos.17, 36 and 45. I can then accept the idea expressed in the second paragraph of amendment no.47. All the amendments mentioned so far refer to the first proposal.As regards the second proposal, it is possible to transpose the ideas presented in the amendments nos.24, 25, 29, 30 and 41 and some parts of amendment n.27, which contain interesting suggestions, even if they must be properly formulated.The commission is willing to welcome them, provided that some changes are made in their formulation.I also take note of the Commission's request for economic and monetary problems to codify the entire text once approved - amendment no.7 of the first and n.22 of the second proposal.The Commission is in favor of a coding and within a short term, after the adoption of the proposals and reserving the right of initiative that belongs to them, it will be committed to developing a coded version;However, I cannot accommodate the current formulation of considering.The Commission also believes that some amendments presented by the Commission for economic and monetary problems would radically change the content of the first proposal.Therefore the commission, albeit reluctantly, cannot be transposed the following amendments relating to the first proposal.Amendment no.8 is not acceptable, as the generic reference proposed to the investments ""indicated in this directive"" to replace the most precise reference to the tools ""referred to in article 19 of the directive"" makes the implementation more difficult.Furthermore, this amendment could lead to different interpretations in the Member States, which perhaps would seek tools mentioned in other articles of the directive."	it
We think that poverty and segregation are the main threats to peace and freedom.Although I agree with what my party colleagues and with the spirit of his document, I would like to attract attention to two deficiencies that must be corrected in the future.The first of them refers to women, gender or women's rights.You referred to the female contribution to increase production and growth.This is important, but equal opportunities between men and women is not only necessary for productivity, but also for democracy in our societies.That is why it is surprising that the words equal opportunities, gender or woman do not seem in shaping the new Europe.In your speech you refer to the woman, but it is not appointed among the strategic objectives.Is this, Mr. Commissioner, that mainstreaming are already consolidated in the commission that is not necessary to mention women?How do you explain this feminine absence?The EU should not become a junction with a male face.My second question refers to Africa.Nor is Africa named the New Europe, but all other continents.In Africa there is the greatest number of refugees, the greatest poverty in the world and there is a cruel AIDS epidemic.I know that Commissioner Nielson and others do a good job, but it is necessary that the entire commission, including its strategic objectives, pay greater attention to this continent.Finally, I want to welcome the statement of the commission and that in it, for the first time, it is said that the EU is prepared unilaterally to take measures that favor the access of developing countries to our markets.My question is: when will this be realized?Mrs. President, Mr. President of the Commission, Lords, we have before us a fundamental document for the future and destiny of Europe.However, among all these aspects, we are especially raised, closely linked to each other: peace and stability in Europe and outside Europe.These are objectives that have to prioritize themselves.For a long time, we all share this idea, but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives cannot be achieved without the extension, although it can behave some costs.Today we have to choose for the next decades between a perhaps less rich but lighthouse of peace and civilization for the entire planet and a perhaps more opulent Europe, but without prophecies.However, these goals can be achieved only if the intergovernmental conference that will end this year, will start a constitutional reform that attributes adequate and real powers to the commission that may no longer be the simple executor of the decisions of the Council or the codecisions of Parliament, but must play the role of true government of Europe.The first courage of this reform should be Parliament if it wants to really expand its role as an interpreter of the will of Europeans and acquire that importance, typical of an authentically democratic and strongly integrated union.	es
"For the light of the events of the past few days, we may wonder what these intergovernmental conferences and these changes in the treaty will be used, when the heads of state and government - in reality, the European Council - take a position in relation to a sovereign Member State by intervening in the democratic process of this Member State.Everyone is free to have their own opinions on Mr. Haider - Personally, I consider him a very dangerous political figure - but we do not have to intervene in the democratic process of a sovereign and friend country.During intergovernmental conferences and when we will re -examine the modifications to be made to the treaty, we will have to take into account the fact that the EU evolves every day, in particular, as we have just seen, in a way contrary to the treaty.I welcome, in this enclosure, this afternoon, at Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency this afternoon.February 14 will see the launch of the CIG which will end by the end of the year 2000. The task is enormous but it can be accomplished.I think that all the groups present here this afternoon generally agree that the agenda of Helsinki will not be enough to cover the reform necessary to prepare Europe for enlargement.In other words, we have to go further than the important ""Amsterdam reliquates"".These include the extension of the qualified majority voting - we accept this in my country, except in the fields relating to taxation - the respondation of the vote within the Council in order to promote the largest states, and the number of commissioners in an enlarged Europe.Regarding the last point, Ireland wants the right to appoint a full -fledged member and without discrimination within the Commission, regardless of the number of Member States that adhere to Europe.We are willing to consider responding to votes within the Council of Ministers, provided that the largest member states accept that each member state has a full member and without discrimination within the Commission.When I lift this specific point, I know that I speak in the name of a large number of smaller states.During the CIG, we should also debate the possible sharing of the treaties in two parts a political field and a field relating to the Constitution.We are ready to accept this sharing if it does not limit the control that the smallest member states had in the renegotiation of all the policies of the treaty.In other words, if we are not fully represented in the Commission, we will not contribute to political discussions.So we follow all this question very closely.We are delighted with the idea of ​​the charter of fundamental rights and impatiently await its content.Mr. President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has set the number of deputies in the European Parliament at 700 and we must debate, within the Parliament, in the way in which these 700 seats will be distributed within extended Europe.Mr. President, I fervently recommend the adoption of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution.This clearly expresses not only our disappointment in the face of the insufficiency of the agenda, but also our desire to see the intergovernmental conference stand as soon as possible."	fr

I believe it is an important step, even if with an impact not particularly evident for national systems.Unfortunately, causing a displeasure to the speaker, I must communicate that my group cannot welcome amendment no.3As regards amendment no.6, in the Commission we had presented a similar amendment.I am a little surprised when I think that you of the PSE group, on that occasion, did not support it.We now intend to support your amendment n.6, but, as I have already said, I wonder why you have not welcomed ours into the commission.I also hope that transparency will be introduced, and that it is possible to proceed with a comparison between the fastest and most effective procedures in the various states.Mr. President, honorable deputies, first of all the Commission underlines that the proposal for the regulation in question this evening constitutes only a reformulation of the agreement relating to the insolvency procedures of 1995. It is known that the aforementioned agreement is the result of long years of discussions, often difficult, often laborious and that for this reason it represents a compromise between the principles of unitary and territoriality, thatlegal systems regarding bankruptcy law in force in the Member States.The awareness that the evolution of the global economic situation and, in particular, of the internal market can make a more frequent use of insolvency procedures that many times have a transfrontier character fully justifies the fact that the European Union, as such, is qualified by the binding legal tools indispensable to ensure that the insolvency procedure is carried out in compliance with a set of common structural principles and guaranteeing rapid execution.Unfortunately or fortunately, the declaration of bankruptcy by the companies will become increasingly common in our daily economic life.This will constitute a factor of renewal of the corporate tissue which must not be blocked due to the existence of slow or obstacles bureaucratic procedures that prolong the agony of companies that are no longer vital.Therefore it is important to try to identify a legal framework of reference adequate to the new needs of the globalized economy.The proposal for the regulation in question was made not by the Commission, but following a joint initiative of two Member States - Germany and Finland - pursuant to the right of initiative they share with the Commission in this field.The Commission believes that the regulation in question does not imply any substantial modification with respect to the text of the Convention.Already in 1981 the Commission had expressed its position in favor of the adoption of the principle of unity of failures.Furthermore, this perspective had been implemented in the proposals presented by the Commission regarding a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of companies.Instead, the 1995 Convention ends up authorizing the opening of secondary procedures, creating derogations from the general rule that the Commission would like it to be accepted.Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text was adopted that expressly married the thesis of unity.	it
Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Central Asia and the Caspian Sea area threaten to become the Balkans of the 21st century.This is also precisely very important to stabilize the great states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.Therefore, I would like to ask him about a subject of his competence, namely, what is the state of the negotiations of cooperation agreements with both countries, that is, of political relations.This is its direct competence;My other question refers to the scope of colleague Nielsen, specifically to ecological cooperation, particularly in regard to water and the problem of cotton monocultures, which aggravate drought.A couple of weeks ago, at the Istanbul Summit, we were able to meet and keep conversations with some of the republics of Central Asia.It is my fervent desire that we intensify our relationships with them.If you wish, I can send your honor a detailed analysis of what exactly the negotiation of the association and cooperation agreements with each of the republics of Central Asia is found.Obviously, everyone will expect their prediction of what can happen in the future to be rather pessimistic.But I have no doubt that he is right when pointing out the strategic importance of Central Asia.I have also listened to your honor to talk about the Caucasus in the past.He is right to affirm that a union that speaks of conflict prevention would have to see what he can do in these specific areas to ensure that in the future there is no type of conflict that has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and that it has cost us much more than we could have spent otherwise, if we had taken more preventive measures to have been possible.Therefore, the reflections of his honor about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well done.We are contributing to programs in the region that have an ecological impact.Our food programs are directly related to structural reforms in the agricultural sector, as well as with the eradication of poverty.These programs themselves are destined to ensure that agriculture has a stronger position in those societies and that it does not simply consist of wearing the earth.There is an ecological aspect that we must continue giving priority.We also take a good note that the deputy author of the question has applauded the answer of Mr. Commissioner.It is not a common fact.And also has not cited Bibliography Mr. Commissioner in this case.Thank you very much, Mr. Patten, for your interventions today.Question No. 35 Formulated by (H-0778/99): Subject: Greek Action Plan for Employment According to the results of the Evaluation of the Employment Action Plan, Greece constitutes, together with Italy, the main objective of the Commission's observations as regards its inconsistency in terms of measures and policies to support employment.	es
With one of the great accidents in recent times, the cargo itself was not dangerous.The margarine and a few kilos of color, which in principle not a risk, caused a real catastrophe.Therefore, it must be checked how the requirements for ensuring a maximum of security can still be optimized.In conclusion, I would like to say that it is about security for all types of transport.This week we will make a pronunciation about the security of maritime traffic due to the catastrophe of Erika, and we will also have to discuss the security goals in air traffic in the course of this year.I want to express that security is a primary goal of the Commission.As I will say in the pronunciation about the Erika, we are not waiting for a disaster to deal with the security aspect, but we are working on the sidelines of these events.However, these show us the urgency of an effective answer to problems of this kind.I would like to thank all speakers and especially the rapporteur, Mr. Koch.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.The report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr. Koch follows on the road on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Foreign Affairs for a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council (KOM (1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083 (COD)) to change the Directive 94/55/EC to adjust the legal provisions for the member stateDangerous goods transport on the street.President, dear wife commissioner, dear colleagues!The guideline that came into force on January 1, 1997 for the adjustment of the legal provisions of the Member States for dangerous goods transport on the street contains some transitional regulations, the validity of which is limited and linked to the conclusion of certain standardization work of the CEN, i.e. the European Committee for Standardization.Delayed delays in the work of the CEN now lead to problems when using this guideline.In particular, attachments cannot be adapted according to technical and industrial development.I regret this because we have to work because others have not done their work.In this respect, I accept the present proposal to change the Directive 94/55/EC.A non -acting of the European Union would oblige the Member States to change their domestic legal provisions for a short period of time, namely until the CEN's work is concluded, which causes unnecessary costs and uncertainties.The change in the directive on today's agenda does not change the harmonization of dangerous goods transport in the community.It only extends transitional rules by moving appointments, it no longer strokes provisions, and it regulates the procedures for a) ad HOC transports of dangerous goods as well as b) the decree of less strictly national regulations, especially in the transport of very low amount of dangerous goods on locally strictly limited areas.The change of the directive is therefore in the sense of subsidiarity;Member States receive more powers.The EU Commission decides whether the Member States can issue certain regulations.It is supported by an expert committee for dangerous goods transport according to the regulatory procedure.The modalities for the exercise of these implementation powers assigned to the Commission were re -regulated by the council decision of June 1999.	de
"I express regret for the delay with which leader, like the other three initiatives, was presented to Parliament and for the consequent delay that this entails in the entire procedure.Lastly, I am worried about the small amount of the amount attributed, if in addition, it is considered that the program this time is open to all the territories of the Union and will be applied for a year more than the previous leader II.I thank the services of the Executive Commission for the availability and collaboration shown, and I thank the colleagues of the Commission for Agriculture for the contribution made through their amendments..(De) Mrs. President, honorable colleagues, my report on Equal constitutes an opinion in the framework of the consultation process on a new community initiative aimed at transnational collaboration to promote new methods of struggle against all forms of discrimination and inequality in the context of the labor market.The relationship is quite long as it also includes the opinions of four other commissions, namely those for industry, regional policy, women and internal affairs.This community initiative collects the legacy of two previous programs, ""Adapt and employment"" and has an extremely small financial endowment, equal to approximately 2.8 billion euros.It adopts a completely new approach, proposing to develop innovative employment models in the framework of transnational development partnerships at geographical or sectoral level.The intention is clearly to have the transnational -aimed projects to develop, projects that follow the four pillars on which the guidelines for employment are based, i.e. professional insertion capacity, entrepreneurial spirit, adaptation skills and strengthening equal opportunities.This objective must certainly be evaluated favorably and collects broad consensus also within the European Parliament.Furthermore, Equal should be integrated into the national action plans for employment, that is, its implementation should also be verified through the aforementioned action plans.It is an important community initiative financed together with the other three, Urban, leader and Interreg, in the framework of the structural funds.In my report I proposed to reduce excessive administrative charges and to make the setting of development partnerships a little more flexible and more open.I believe that technical assistance is certainly necessary but, due to the problems that arose with the previous technical assistance offices (BAT), new BAT must be established before the approval of the Parliament resolution by preventing political responsibility from being transferred to technical assistance.However, the need remains to be able to count on technical assistance.Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and mutual learning through the spread of best practices and mainstreaming.I worked so that the report gathered the broadest consent and this determined the reduction of the number of amendments - from 100 in the commission to 22 in the plenary - also allowing to seize numerous possibilities of compromise.A compromise has also been reached on the question of asylum seekers.In this regard, Mrs. President, to allow you to develop the details again, please vote on the Equal report on Wednesday instead of tomorrow."	it
"Mr. President, I would have a question relating to a concrete and real case in which the precautionary principle could be applied.It concerns the fireproof substances added to the bromine.The problem only comes to the fore, with high concentrations both in the environment and in the human body.Many argue that these substances involve serious risks, others instead tend to minimize.Recently, within the Council, both Sweden and Denmark have urged the Commission to take the initiative to prohibit fireproof substances at the bromine.I therefore wonder if such a prohibition is in preparation and if this initiative could not frame itself perfectly in your vision of the principle of precaution itself.Mr. President, I thank the honorable Sjöstedt for asking this question: the problem of fireproof substances added to the bromine is a serious problem.It has been raised recently within the ""Environment"" Council by a series of ministers who ask the Commission to study the terms and indicate how to intervene.Now we are examining the question of establishing what the current state of knowledge on the subject is and what can be done.However, I would like to remember that the appeal to the precautionary principle is not necessarily synonymous with prohibition and total tender.A series of different measures can be hypothesized: one cannot immediately speak of prohibition.As regards now to the fireproof substances added to the bromine, it may be that, over time, one of them are reached, but it is important to remember that the precautionary principle allows to resort to the entire range of political interventions and possible measures.This is a problem of maximum topicality.The Commission will have to carry out its work by scrupulously examining the question before expressing itself on what to do.You said that the precautionary principle should not become a disguised form of commercial protectionism.Is there an agreement on this point on the two sides of the Atlantic?I think we will have problems, especially for the meat to the genetically modified hormones and crops.Are we sure that on this principle the interpretation of the Americans coincides with ours?Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to communicate that in Montreal we have signed a protocol on biological security.At that time, we managed to achieve international consensus around the definition of the precautionary principle.I believe that having managed to sign that protocol represents a decisive step forward.I believe that it will make school in view of future discussions around the principle of precaution and that it will be able to act as an example of interpretation of its principle, principle to which a role of instrument as important as it is effective is recognized.Mr. President, I would have two questions that I will try to exhibit with the utmost brevity.My first question concerns the application of the precautionary principle.I seem to understand that some uncertainties exist regarding his interpretation.Do you have to first conduct a risk assessment, including costs and benefits analysis?If so, I find it truly disturbing, because precisely the analysis of costs and benefits should not have been used as a criterion to decide whether or not to resort to the precautionary principle: it is the principle of precaution that has precedence."	it
Always on the same basis, it is essential that the Member States obtained their obligation to report the Commission on the aid granted in favor of their steel companies, as prescribed article 7 of the code in question.The Commission suggests that the States send these reports within two months of the end of each semester and, in any case, on an annual basis, without being obliged to solicit them.I too like the speaker, I rejoiced the Commission's report although it did not contemplate all aspects relating to aid.Although the code of the aid to the steelurgy is formulated in a very clear way, the Commission, on various occasions, has authorized the granting of aid to steel companies that did not fall within the categories provided for by the Code.For the purposes of greater equity it would therefore be necessary to rigorously apply the aid code or modify it if the Commission wants to authorize aid other than those legally admitted at the moment.Finally, the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the Czech treaty arises.It will be necessary to make sure that the aid system continues over 2002. On this point, they are the opinion that only a Council regulation will offer the necessary legal security and guarantee the formal prohibition of any help not contemplated by the code.For all these reasons, I voted in favor of the report of Mr Langen and I am now waiting for the Commission to answer our questions and requests.(The session, suspended at 13.05, resumes at 15.00) Sea polluted by oil in France the agenda bears the declaration of the commission on the sea polluted by oil in France.On behalf of the commission, Commissioner Loyola De Palacio has the right to the name of the intervention of which the discussion opens.Mr. President, I intervene in the name of the PPE/De group but also as an elected Breton, directly involved and shocked by these events.With Françoise Grossetête and the PPE/de, we presented a resolution proposal.Today, we are faced with a compromise proposal and I am happy.The shipwreck of Erika is actually a European question because it mutilates and insudes some of the most beautiful European beaches with very serious consequences for tourism, for those who carry out a maritime activity, for the defenders of the environment and then because regulation and control are in question whose natural dimension is clearly European.Certainly a catastrophe of this reach would not have been possible off the American coast.Why?Because the Americans were capable of learning from the catastrophe of the Exxon Valdez and in 1990 they have drawn up the Oil Pollution Act which confers greater responsibilities since it can imply the responsibility of the rented, it is more binding and above all provides for a better control through various regulations and in particular through the body of the American guardos.If we had had similar provisions, I repeat, the catastrophe would certainly not have verified.For this reason we believe that it is necessary to review the applicable legislation and in particular the 1992 protocol that exempted the rentals, in this case the oil company that has rented, from any responsibility.	it
"There is talk of the help of pre -adhesion, and this is the responsibility of Rubric 7. Last year Parliament accepted, exceptionally, that the sums intended for these expenses appeared in address book 4, and in this way the two candidate countries are not treated on a feet of a tie with the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe, while they should be, in accordance with the declarations of the European Council of Helsinki.They must therefore be set aside funds in column 7, in which a revision of financial perspectives is needed.This is the crucial point.The essential question is that the money intended for pre -adhesion aid for Cyprus and Malta is taken from address book 7, and that a revision of the financial perspectives is revised, since if the Council does not support this measure, it actually acts in contrast with its decisions of Helsinki in December.As for the amount indicated in the Brok report, 130 million euros, I would like to say, on behalf of the liberal group, which we must define an amount, we must negotiate until we establish the amount of the amount.The most important thing is that a multi -year program is guaranteed and that appears in the correct column, so that it is possible to start programming for Cyprus and Malta.Mr. President, the Green Libera European Alliance supports the decision adopted by the European Council of Helsinki, according to which the solution of the conflict cannot represent a preliminary condition for the adhesion of Cyprus.A strong pressure on the Government of Cyprus must be maintained, but the will of the majority of the population cannot be the subject of a blackmail, of a blackmail, of a part of it, also because we express strong doubts about the representativeness of the government of that part of the island.It is clear that the window of opportunities - the ""Janela de Oportunidades"", cited by the presidency - must be exploited to the maximum.But we are also convinced that, despite the Turkish-Greek relationships have improved, this cannot be sufficient.The solution of the conflict to Cyprus passes mainly through the improvement of the relationships between the two communities, in view of the Constitution - we hope not too distant - of a federation.In particular, we must operate for the resolution of the issue of the factory of effective freedom of circulation, the problem of demilitarization and the disarmament of the island.The European Union must assume more decidedly, beyond financial support - certainly important - an active role as guarantor and promoter of contacts between the two communities, establishing fora and confident -building programs.I want to say that at this moment I miss a lot, within the European Parliament, by Alex Langer, who was a peacemaker and an example for all of us of how coexistence is built among peoples.Mr. President, the evocation of the dialogue between the two Cypriot factions under the auspices of the UN reminds us that 26 years after the invasion of the island by the Turkish army, from the occupation of almost 40 percent of the territory with 35 000 soldiers and heavy military vehicles, the settlement of over 50 000 colonists continues in total violation of the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council."	it
Now, for this to act, it is fundamental that there remains a public service.This is only how it is possible to guarantee that the network, from removal to distribution, remains full, that it cannot be fragmented or only used in part, according to pairs with the operators of the postal service.But, in the meantime, we know that the Commission, following the directive on common rules for community postal services, commissioned studies, the results of which have not been transmitted to the European Parliament, according to which the impacts of the impact of this directive is unknown, whether at the level of the service offered to citizens or from the point of view of current European postal operators, both at the level of economic aspects.Thus, in our opinion, it is necessary to interrupt the entire process of implementing the said directive, including its calendar.And any modification of the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications, always keeping the objective of guaranteeing a quality public service, the maintenance of current public operators and existing workstations.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fundamentally support this proposal while starting by asking whether what the previous speaker said - namely, that we need on the one hand of a competitive innovative quality service and that on the other hand, this service must be a public service - is not a contradiction in itself.I think we have a differentiated approach here.European policy has released monopoly markets - energy, telecommunications and air navigation - and the consumer has always been the point of sight.The objective was precisely to offer better service, and it is also the user who must be at the center of the liberalization of La Poste.I think the consumer can decide himself and define what he needs.To do this, he needs no government, any parliament, and he needs no commission either!The post office market follows from afar, and it is, alas, that we have wasted precious time.I think we should also give La Poste the chance to respond to new developments.I refer here to the very good intervention of my colleague Mr. Rübig, who also talked about electronic commerce here.This evolution will arrive very quickly and will bring new requirements for the different companies of our company, requirements to which we must respond very quickly and very flexible.I believe that the liberalized market accelerates this development more than a less liberalized market.In addition, there is also the possibility of representing European policy in a positive way.We must also seize this chance because the citizen always raises the question of the why of Europe.These are the fields where citizen distinguishes in a perceptible way the usefulness of Europe.But I also delighted that the Competition Commissioner, Mr. Monti, is personally present today, because he carries out an excellent policy.And I would like to address here an area where Parliament and the Commission must in my opinion, and this also emerges from this debate, questioning the establishment of a competition limit.We approve the competition as a element of the social market economy - we also do it because we want to make this economic system the best possible.	fr
I refer in particular to the structural pre -adhesion tool (SSPA) of which I will be responsible in the coming weeks.Mrs parliamentarians, as you can see, have just launched the new programming that we already find ourselves formulating a reflection on the impact of the expansion of the union on our structural policy.The sixth periodic report on which, Mr Berend, you have formulated a widely positive judgment, constitutes for us and for me a good basis for reflection.I sincerely thank you for your contribution to reflection on future guidelines and also for the good application of the directors for the period 2000-2006.Approval of the verbal process of the previous session the verbal process of the previous session has been distributed.Are there any objections?Mr. President, in response to the invitation addressed to me yesterday afternoon by the president of Parliament, I intervene on behalf of my group regarding point 11 of the report of yesterday's session relating to the fixation of the order of the works.First of all, I believe that the question raised yesterday by the President of the Socialist Group regarding the reintegration, in the agenda, of the discussion with the President of the Commission on the strategic objectives for the next five years was so important for the other deputies who had asked to intervene briefly, that their request could have been accepted.I would like to specify this belief of mine even if, with all due respect, I found myself disagreed with the motion of the president of the socialist group and I voted against.My second observation - which I would have liked to formulate yesterday before the vote - is that Parliament, like other honorable colleagues, recalled yesterday, can operate in a truly effective way only if he works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission.We should also have the humility to admit that if we had wanted a strategic discussion accompanied not only by a presentation and a clarification by the President of the Commission, but equally from a five -year program, we would have had to organize ourselves in detail before - and do not wait until the week before the discussion in the classroom -, so that we can debate and report our desired commission to the Commission.I would like us to teach a teaching from this experience: whenever in the future, discussions of great importance between Parliament and European Commission will be put on the age of the day, all the details regarding our mutual expectations should be clarified at least a good month in advance, first of all between the political groups of this Parliament and then between the Parliament and the Commission, so as not to find us at the last moment in the unpleasant position of causing an institutional relationship in vain.After giving a last to the articles published by the press last Friday, I seem to be able to say that the Commission, in the person of its president, has given proof of commendable moderation in commenting on the facts and I appreciate it immensely.I hope we will learn the lesson and avoid repeating such an experience based, in my opinion, on an incorrect interpretation of expectations, rather than on the bad faith by one of the two institutions.	it
Unfortunately, as everyone has recognized during military actions in Kosovo, civil sectors, in particular linked to the fields of infrastructure which directly concern populations, and even inhabited areas have been affected during NATO air actions.It is a recognized fact, it happens in all wars and the war of Kosovo is not a clean war, it is not an exemplary war, it is the possible war.I know it was a necessary war.It was the possible war, it was the war necessary to put an end to what was an absolutely unacceptable assault and perfectly condemned by the entire international community.Mr. Deputy, regardless of the reading that we can do a posteriori -it is easy to engage in a posteriori readings, if there had been no actions -I think that given what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the impunity of what happened there and the extension of this impunity, we can give ourselves to a less catastrophic reading of NATO actionKosovo.Question nº 4 of (H-0028/00): Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia since the European Union actively encourages the development of social, economic and political relations with Armenia, within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement signed on October 12, 1999, what measures does the Council take to persuade the Turkish government to remove the economic blockade of Armenia?The time has come to the Turkish government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia for the Turkish government?Mr. President, I would like to thank the representative of the presidency of the council for his answer.However, I am a little sad that we see this above all on the bilateral level when it is ultimately a triangular relationship.We grant partnership funds and we have a cooperation agreement to help Armenia, and the aid is nevertheless ineffective, because Turkey maintains an economic blockade so that many things cannot achieve Armenians.We negotiate with Turkey for its possible membership and it is in our interest to all that any state wanting to become a member of the EU also has friendly relations with its neighbors.Can you not exert a greater influence on Turkey to facilitate a peaceful development, to make Armenians access the development necessary for the continuation of collaboration?You are absolutely right, madam, to say that we must take advantage of relations with Turkey precisely so that this country can play a constructive role in this situation and, in particular, so that it is part of the solution and that it ceases to be part of the problem.We believe that the fact that Turkey has entered a new phase of relations with the European Union and that it is confronted with the need to provide an answer to the European Union positions in matters of foreign policy and common security represents - it must be said - a test of the will of this country in relation to the priorities of the European Union in its relationship with the outside.	fr
We considered this problem, do you think!We have considered it and scrutinize it with great attention, especially thanks to the concerns you have exposed.Frankly, I do not believe that these fears are ultimately justified.The Commission's proposal gives it a central role in determining the orientations of the competition policy.The reform does not imply any reduction in the work of the Commission but a refocusing of these on the larger files.It will lead to a progressive development of European competition culture - I allow myself to insist on this fact because the expression used by President Randzio -Plat, which I fully share, struck me a lot.The reform will therefore lead to a transplantation, to a rooting, in the field of European competition culture, where today varying plants prospered, which are not uniform, different national cultures in the field of competition.The fifteen national rights will be gradually abandoned to give way to a larger use of Community law which can be applied by a greater number of actors.This is, I would like to emphasize this, a communitarization and not a renationalization of competition law.Application consistency.The risk of an incoherent application of competition rules must be kept in mind, but I believe that it should not be exaggerated.Like many other provisions of the Treaty, articles 81, paragraph 1, and 82 have been applied for decades and national judges and it does not seem to me that it has created big problems.In a regime of legal exception, the maintenance of consistency will first depend on the clarity of material rules.The Commission will strive to refine the legislative framework, both by acts of general scope and by its decision -making practice.Conflict prevention prevention and the White Paper will also have to be established contains information and consultation mechanisms.On this subject, I would like to say two words about the idea, which I find excellent, of Mrs. Riis-Jørgensen and Mr. Huhne, namely the idea of ​​monitoring the application.So this is the idea for monitoring the application.I believe that this idea is judicious and that we will probably adopt it.Although we deeply respect the work carried out by the national competition responsible for competition, among others, it is clear that we will carefully examine the way in which the legislation of the EC will be applied by the national authorities and the courses.This is the reason why the Commission wants to maintain the right to withdraw a case from the hands of a national authority responsible for competition in the event that the application is not correct.It can somewhat relieve your concerns, Ms. Peijs.(En) To respond to the point raised by Mr. Evans concerning the impact on companies, it is important to say that the analysis of costs and yields should be carried out seriously.The objective of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to bring together the comments issued by companies and other sources.We have received excellent observations and contributions in large numbers which offer us the necessary elements in order to carry out an assessment of costs and yields for companies.We will examine all this material carefully before developing a legislative proposal for a new regulation.	fr
You will certainly say yes, but I would like to know from you: do the gentlemen also know what that means in consequence?The next question, Ms. Wallström: When will you start to apply this in legislation, for example in chemical laws, for example in legislation in other areas?The last question: Will we be able to recognize where this was used in the legislation?That is, there will be an extra -dab in every suggestion that says that the precautionary principle has been checked and has you come to this result?Thank you very much, Ms. Roth-Behrendt, for these questions.Of course, the entire commission shares this view.This is a joint message created by us three, David Byrne, Erki Liikania and myself, which was also unanimously adopted in the Commission today.She met with great support from the other commissioners and is the result of a consultation of the various departments within the Commission.So we have worked through this document really well, and I am sure that everyone is able to explain the guidelines and principles that are explained in this document.Yes, I would even say that we this working method on various difficult topics, such as:B. already apply to the question of a new strategy in the field of chemicals.And I am sure that we will also expressly point out if we work with this principle.Especially recently, we applied the precautionary principle in a case that dealt with the ban on phthalates in toys made of soft PVC, and of course we fall back on it in various environmental areas.It was mainly used in the environmental area, but also with questions of human health.So we will try to make very clear how and when it is to be used.President, Ms. Commissioner!In terms of the relationship between science and the recourse to the precautionary principle, the communication that the use of the pension principle is required, especially if science has no evidence.This naturally transmits a high degree of power to science.We can ask ourselves which scientists will deliver this documentation and what they defend.Since it also says that a sufficiently recognized minority of scientists is sufficient to apply the precautionary principle, I ask: What is the definition of a recognized minority?How do you describe this?How do you get a recognized minority?With regard to the political decision, my question is: Who makes this political decision?The Commission?Or the advice?To what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role?What role is the scientific committees intended?What will the role of the food authorities to set up?In conclusion: Will this decision -making process be transparent, publicly made?These are my three questions.Yes, Mr. President, that's right.There were many difficult topics that were not always very clear and clear, but I want to try to answer some of the questions.Who will make the decision, who is the decision -makers?Well, it depends on who the legislators are.This is part of the risk management.	de
I would like to ask the President in office for the Council if, after spending a few hours to work in the classroom with the deputies of the European Parliament, he had the opportunity to evaluate what they are worth in terms of pay.Mr Parliamentary, since the discussion relating to the fees of European parliamentarians does not only concern his country, but also extends to mine, I know exactly how much the wages of the deputies to the European Parliament are.I am therefore perfectly aware of the problem.Mr. President, I would like to thank for this answer and present a complementary question in part similar to that placed by the honorable Sjöstedt.We both come from Sweden.In our country the bulk of the taxes is paid in the form of local taxes, because public services are managed locally and because they are quite extensive.In Sweden there is a problem of trust towards politicians, not least towards the European politicians of this parliament.In his opinion, what would be the impact for our credibility of politicians, if we recognize the right to take advantage of the services in the place of residence - school, health, etc. - without paying the taxes, without contributing to you?In your opinion, how would this affect our credibility of politicians?Mr. President in office for the Council, this is a question to which you are not obliged to answer because he is truly philosophical.But if he wants to go into the field of philosophy, please!No, Mr. President, philosophy does not try.These are basic issues that have to do with the matrix of the deputy statute and its role in the framework of the political system.I do not want to go into this type of discussion, as it seems to me that I can go to prejuger, to use a French expression, of the interpretation that the Portuguese presidency will give in the context of negotiations on the statute of the deputies, in which it is involved.I would ask you to exempt myself from making comments of any kind in this regard.Since the time of questions to the Council has ended, the questions from n.11 to n.35 will receive response in writing.With this the time of the questions ends.(The session, suspended at 19.05, resumes at 9.00 pm) Allocation of the President of the Czech Republic, Václav Havel Mr. President, honorable parliamentarians, is a great honor for me to address, on behalf of the European Parliament, a warm welcome greeting to the President of the Czech Republic Václav Havel.I would also like to welcome Mrs. Havel, present in the stands.(Applause) It is not the first time we welcome her to Parliament, Mr. President.You have already had the opportunity to speak in the plenary session in Strasbourg almost six years ago, in March 1994, and many of us, who were already parliamentarians at that time, still retain a living memory.In fact, immediately after the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, she had pronounced in favor of a strengthening of European values, the creation of a European ethics, the opening of the Union to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.This means that for many citizens, not only of her country, she embodies that Europe of the values ​​to which we feel deeply linked.	it
"The Commission reaffirmed and reaffirms today that shares the concerns underlying the declaration of January 31 of the Portuguese presidency.These concerns are legitimate and grounded.It will not be necessary to remember here the political trajectory of Jörg Haider and his numerous public statements, xenophobes and racist and, therefore, antieuropeas.That a clearly extremist, racist and xenophobic party comes to power in a Member State of the European Union cannot stop worrying the remaining states participating in the European project, nor does it leave indifferent to the European Commission.Second, the Commission reiterated and reiterates its commitment to continue exercising its duty as a guarantor of the treaties, particularly in relation to articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty of the Union.One of the important innovations of the Amsterdam Treaty was precisely the explanation of the fundamental principles that are the common heritage of the Member States and the institution of a mechanism to control their fulfillment and reaction in case of violation of one of these principles.The Commission thus demonstrated, in practice, its attachment to one of the basic principles -that of the rule of law -that imposes on the commission the obligation to act within the limits established by the treaties and in that framework the declaration of February 1 is located.The commission is not a state, it cannot and should not act as if it were.But to answer specifically to the question of his honor, I must remember that the mechanism instituted by section 1 of article 7 of the Treaty of the Union requires, to be activated, the verification -cito- ""of a serious and persistent violation of the principles enshrined in article 6"".Serious and persistent violation is - I repeat - the indispensable condition for the commission to propose to the Council the adoption of measures against a Member State.It seems clear to me that the conditions for its application to the situation in Austria are not met.For the rest, we all want - I don't think I fool myself in saying it - that these conditions of serious and persistent violation of human rights and democracy never come to be given, or in relation to Austria or in relation to any other state of the Union.But I want to guarantee him here, today, my personal effort and that of the commission, as President Prodi has reaffirmed this morning, to do everything that is needed so that it is not necessary to apply the device of article 7. But I also want to assure his lordships that we will not hesitate to apply it, if necessary.Too nuclear and essential values ​​are at stake so that contemplations or compounds can be admitted.Men and governments must be judged more for what they do for what they say.And in the case of Austria, the statements are at least contradictory.On the one hand, any of us can collect a set of incendiary phrases from the leader of the Austrian Liberal Party.On the other, the program of the new Austrian government renews its commitment to the defense of democracy and human rights."	es
In March of last year, a member of the Sam Raininte party was assassinated by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal.In September, two members of the party were arrested on the grounds that they were involved in an attack on the arugula against the Prime Minister.Note that it is the only Cambodian party who does not have a military wing.In October, a parliamentarian of the same party was removed by men in uniform and was only released after payment of a ransom.The intimidation scheme is clear.But other things are still going on in Cambodia;Torture of prisoners, involvement of the army and the police in the trafficking of women and children, excessive preventive arrests.All this is on the agenda.Even more serious is the government's refusal to have the leaders of the Khmers Rouge judged by an international court.It is true that the civil war in Cambodia is over and that political tensions are less.However, the way in which the political opposition is treated at present causes us deep concerns and, if this continues, this must have consequences on the relations of the Union with Cambodia.Mr. President, a new doctrine is being trained in international law, according to which no state will no longer be able to deal with its citizens and people living in its territory anyhow and the sovereignty of a state can no longer prevent third parties from intervening in the event of aggravated human rights violations, even in cases where the leaders of a state have been legally or even democratically elected.Living examples of this were the case Pinochet-Ugarte and Kosovo or, less flagrant but within the Union itself, the debates on the formation of the new Austrian government.This development will now be compromised in Cambodia if the former management of the oppressive regime cannot be prosecuted.At the same time, we endanger the fight against impunity.The situation should also remind us of the fact that the ratification of the treaty establishing the international criminal tribunal was shamefully slow.Mr. President, the human rights debate that we held yesterday will have been extremely useful.I am delighted that we have once again had the opportunity to examine a certain number of regions of the world Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights constitutes a particularly great challenge.First of all, with regard to Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these resolution projects with regard to general policy with regard to Kosovo, the continuation of ethnic violence and prisoners in Serbian prisons.In Kosovo, as well as in the region, our efforts are aimed at short and medium -term recovery and long -term stabilization.We support in particular the development of a free, democratic and multi -hethnic society.Our assistance programs in the areas of democratization and human rights should continue to establish confidence in general and try to establish confidence between different communities in particular.	fr
B5-0173/2000 of the deputies Papayannakis and Sjöstedt, on behalf of the Gue/NGL, B5-0179/2000 of Schroedter deputies and others, in the name of the green group/ALE on the environmental disaster in the waters of the Danube.Mr. President, this week, we discussed the framework directive on water and the disaster in Romania shows us once again how seriously we have to take the protection of water.This disaster has raised a certain number of important questions that concern us as a European.We are delighted with the promise that rivers will be cleaned with the help of the EU.The strengthening of environmental consciousness, both in Romania and, more generally, in central and eastern Europe, is at least as important.We salute the speed of the visit of Commissioner Wallström on the spot because it can contribute to this awareness.In the end, it is a candidate state and this disaster adds to the already existing concern to know if all the candidate states will in time satisfy the EU environmental rules.The polluter must pay.I wonder if the European Union can pass on this kind of costs on environmental cowboys that work in what is called wild by using the weakness of environmental legislation on site.I would be favorable.Mr. President, the Commissioner, the ecological disasters follow each other and, unfortunately, are alike.There is enough to be dismayed, once again, by this serious pollution which today defiles the fourth wetland in Europe in order of importance.The Danube delta is in danger.As in Spain, in April 1998, as in Brittany and Vendée since last December, this time again, an exceptional natural site which is seriously threatened.In its resolutions, the European Parliament continues to draw attention to the dangers of this type that threaten our environment, upset our ecosystem and weaken, once again, the populations.This new catastrophe poses the problem of integration of the community acquired in environmental matters for candidate countries.The authorities of these states must overcome, still very fragile from an environmental point of view, are numerous.First, they should be able to prevent this type of spill more by developing the most critical industrial sites;Then, they should be able to have sufficient technical means to stop such pollution and reduce its magnitude;Finally, they should be able to implement programs to restore the most affected and sensitive sites.Today, the banks and waters of more than four rivers travel over four states are polluted.This is why the European Union must concentrate its efforts and pressures on the imperative need for all candidate countries, to align themselves on community environmental protection standards.But beyond that, it is the technologies and the means put in to prevent, and to meet this type of disasters quickly and effectively, which are involved.	fr
"To conclude, in relation to the Charter of fundamental rights, European citizens must become aware of their citizenship.The euro and occupation are not enough, nor safety.They need a ""European soul"", as an distinguished Spanish professor said.Mr. President, unlike some speakers intervened previously, I want to return to the words spoken by the Portuguese ministers and the Commissioner Vitore.The words of this trio were music for our ears, as Mr Ceyhun said.As with any type of music, the motif played must be intoned and adequately orchestrated.Many of us deputies are very optimistic about the next six months.The reason that will be played will be what European populations will listen to and want to hear the right type of melody.As mentioned this afternoon, it will serve to make some of the unpleasant melodies that we have listened to during the European elections and over the past few months.The Treaty of Amsterdam and the Council of Tampere were based on this project of a space of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.However, a sector is very important and Parliament must be involved, that is to say that of verification.There are many laws - and I really welcome the Portuguese program that was presented to us last week - but we must be absolutely sure that there is a control, that the members of Parliament and those of national parliaments as well as European citizens are aware of everything they entail.In addition, we must ascertain that the details are applicable, adequate and relevant to the various countries.I would like to draw attention to some aspects of the resolutions examined this afternoon, one or two of which have already been mentioned.I express my satisfaction for the tendency to recognize judicial systems in the various countries and cooperation in the fight against crime.It is a sector to which European citizens will respond with interest and of which they will be satisfied.The Commission and the Council must know, however, that many of us in the classroom nourish reserves on the Eurodac system, for example.We accept the predominant role of the Council in this area, but there are some reserves and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words expressed by European parliamentarians when the topic will be deepened.Mr Schulz said before not being sure about the definition of ""scoreboard"".Anyone who is English or British or follows the cricket knows what it is.A scoreboard serves to indicate the score and must be updated, clear and visible.I am sure that Commissioner Vitore will make sure that it is.At the end of the six months I hope that music continues to play and that Europeans are still listening to.Mr. President, I would like to welcome the President in office for the Council and his colleague of the Ministry of Justice, Mr. Costa, thanking them for the reception reserved for Lisbon last week to the commission I presided and for the construction meeting we had.Amsterdam and Tampere have given us a lot of work to be done together, as evidenced by the excellent resolution proposal presented today by the honorable terrón I Cusí."	it
To do this, a European Commission is needed, which, beyond good intentions, gives greater clarity to its directors and is committed to a maximum of control on the commitment of these resources by the Member States.Italy, for example, in recent years has had problems in using structural funds, above all due to excessive bureaucracy, a lack of information and the low involvement of economic and social operators at the local level.There are therefore two points on which I would like to attract the attention of the Commission: in the first place, it is necessary to make the best use of concertation as a method of coordination and participation in decisions by all local and regional operators, precisely to avoid imbalances and inequalities;Secondly, an authentic work of simplification and transparency of administrative processes is needed, which too often are unnecessarily long and complex to the point of affecting access to funds, which are especially complained of small and medium -sized European enterprises.I conclude, Mr. President, saying that it is quite serious that in the communication of the Commission a little attention to the territorial pacts and above all to the methods of fighting female and youth unemployment has been paid.Mr. President, in the same way for the honorable Evans, it is for me a particular pleasure to be able to stand up for my first intervention in this parliament during the discussion of a theme of this importance, especially since I represent the West Midlands, a region of the United Kingdom who has so far benefited from the funding reserved for objective 2. However, the relationship in question is a clear example of how we are not very cautious,who seem great, but which instead are devoid of consistency and therefore prove to be useless for those who should immediately benefit from it.The intent of the relationship is good but, as often happens when we deal with these issues, its objectives are not clearly defined and lacks a solid basis that can make it of some use.For this reason the reason my group and I propose three amendments and substantial additions to the text, aimed not so much to remove something from the proposal, but to make it more relevant for those to whom he must serve as a guide.I want to illustrate what our reasoning is.First, we want to ensure that the resources of the structural funds and the cohesion fund are used adequately.The past experience teaches us that we, as elected representatives of European taxpayers, must be demanded for prohibited and financial transparency in the disbursements and control of these funds.Therefore our amendments and additions are aimed at finding profitability indicators in the process of granting and spending on funds.Second, too often large sums of money are spent for projects whose results at the beginning of the programming are inevitably vague.But in the middle or end of this period there is no effective way to stop a project that proved to be useless.Therefore our additions ask to predict interruption strategies impossible to practice, so that not only is there the necessary guarantee in relation to current expenses, often poured on the taxpayer, but that we can also avoid the well -known syndrome for which you continue to spend money to carry on a project that has already proven to be a failure.	it
"These inspections can usually take place on the street, in ports or at other parking spaces or, as far as the public service vehicles are concerned, in the facilities of the owners.In fact, there are already several states that carry out controls of this kind, the so -called ""controls on the roadside"", as they are intended in the directive, that is, to a certain extent unexpected.Perhaps this is really the best way to achieve effective control of the condition of the vehicles that use our road network.I would like to say that the commission of the concern of parliament is aware that this proposal can lead to discrimination against private transport companies or from commercial vehicles from certain countries or even from certain vehicle brands and that its rapporteur intends with the main recommendation that the penalties imposed by the Member States are harmonized as a prerequisite for the application of this guideline.However, we share this concern, but it is of the opinion that change application 2 is too radical, and in this sense we would support amendment 3, which takes up the spirit of what we all strive for and at the same time offers sufficient flexibility.We also accept change application 1, and I would like to respond to what Mr. Bouwman said.We are very concerned about the fact that vehicles are on the streets of the Union whose drivers are citizens from third countries, in particular from accession countries, and which do not have employment contracts in accordance with the municipality's provisions or a state, but simply to the standards of these third -country candidates, or sometimes not even that, because there are no corresponding controls in these third countries.In a letter to all Minister of Transport of the Fifteen States of the Union, I have opposed a debate on this question and also to request a report about what experiences you have gained in your countries with such cases and what positive suggestions you can do in order to solve this problem that is very worried and the negative effect on traffic safety, and on what it has to be important to us, and on a fair competition, and a fair competition, andwhich we can also attach importance to the commission.In this sense, I hope that we can treat these questions in the next Council ""Transport"" at the end of this month, as well as all questions, as Mr. Watts said, in relation to traffic safety in general, since the Portuguese government describes it as one of the key issues in its presidency.Based on the great progress achieved in recent years, I believe that there is still a lot to do, because 42,000 - 43,000 European citizens who are killed on the streets are too high.Even greater efforts have to be made.But I would like to say about the question of drivers from third countries that we hopefully have an answer until the end of the month, and in any case we will treat them in the council.And in connection with an inquiry or an initiative, I will be able to give an answer here in parliament, either during the plenary session or in the committee.Otherwise, I will definitely hope that in the foreseeable future we can make a concrete proposal that enables the effective and real fight against such misuse."	de
That does not prevent these Member States from taking measures in relation to public order within the framework of the obligation of prior declaration.For the Commission, the proposal that the legal residence in a Member State is still in force three months after the expiration of the card validity period is not acceptable.It is not acceptable that the national of a third state continues to reside for longer in the receiving state after the provision of services.For that reason, the Commission supports both aspects of Mrs. Palacio in both aspects.With regard to the second proposal, the commission includes the desire that it should be clear what is meant by independent worker and wants to provide a solution for it in the modified proposal.These are some preliminary observations on the most important amendments.I hope you grant me again at the end of this debate, when all the speakers have spoken, the possibility of going into detail about the different amendments.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the vast majority of the members of the PPE group will vote tomorrow in favor of the amendments of the Commission of Legal Affairs and the Modified version.I will just comment on two points.In the first place we must ask ourselves what is intended to achieve - in the literal meaning of the term - with the proposed directive.On the one hand are the interests of the economy and also of the individual.In my considerations of the assumption that it is an honest individual who does a good job.On the other hand are the interests of the Member States that, in the face of those affected, perhaps should start from the idea that it is a Worst Case.If we are inclined to one of the extremes, namely the interests of the Member States, they are undoubtedly sufficient reasons to subject the service provision card to relatively strict conditions.From this point of view, it is legitimate to introduce the obligation of prior declaration, even when the use of the card is implanted.If I opt for the other extreme, that is, for the least amount of procedures as possible, it runs the risk that the procedure is staying in borage water, since, in that case, this directive will surely not have the approval of the Member States.I mean, one of two.Or I have a directive regarding the service provision card that does not really allow the card to be issued to anyone, since the demands imposed on the economy are too rigid, or I find myself without a directive.Both results are unsatisfactory.Perhaps this is the reason why, as they tell us, negotiations within the Council are also in dead road.We have struggled to find a point of intersection between one interest - the public order - and another.We have struggled to find the simplest solution.We want a solution that imposes demands on the economy, but that, once these demands have been exceeded, guarantee a simple application.	es
I should suggest, Mrs. President, that Parliament first waits for whether the party of Mr. Haider will influence the policy of that country.Then and only then could they judge whether human rights are affected.This parliament could consider suitable measures to counter this situation, and then, and only then, could it consider to interfere in the constitutional matters of a country of the European Union.Mrs. President, as a member of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns of some colleagues about democratic development in Austria.You may be surprised about my reaction if I find that the special sensitivity to Austria in questioning human rights, the awareness of responsibility towards my own past and the stability of democracy meets my personal understanding.Austria has the often dubious image, which prevails abroad or unjustifiably, is responsible for itself.The years of refusal to admit our governments, our complicity to the horror of World War II, and the refusal of the governments of just reparation towards the Jewish victims and the forced labor have contributed significantly to this negative image.Now this FPÖ has entered a government coalition with the ÖVP due to an election order dated October 3, 1999, when the old government was elected.This is the right of the citizens of a state because it is the basic principle of a democracy.After the talks between the SPÖ and the ÖVP, the socialists tried to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for support.We were offered three ministerial posts - you only need to read this in the newspapers -, of all people, of all people who is denounced here as a fascist!When we suddenly rejected this offer, a passionate agitation and propaganda began, which we still have not understood.The FPÖ is a party established in the political landscape of Austria.She puts the governor in one of the nine federal states and is involved in all other governments.Why, so many Austrians are wondering today, their democratic decision is suddenly interpreted as an expression of the fascist attitude, why did the agitation only began when the freedoms rejected the support of a minority government of the SPÖ?Here there is a preliminary conviction that - without responding to our program - reduces the cruelest epoch in European history into a political spectacle.It increases my disgust when some of our opponents take advantage of the million -dollar deaths in the gas chambers of the concentration camp for cheap propaganda, such as the Italian MP Bertinotti, who accused Herr Haider on Italy yesterday that he would deny the Holocaust.Ashamed, Mr. Colleague!Even if you assume all political arguments, you don't have the right to use the murdered for your cheap propaganda.You don't become an anti -fascist here if you denounce a democratically elected politician as a Nazi!On the contrary, they mock the true victims of National Socialism and trivialize the fascist dictatorships.They act because of their own prejudices, forego every political discussion and act exactly in the style they pretend.The attack against the new government of Austria, the attempt to influence political influence in a member country is an insult to the Austrian population.	de
We cannot afford to delay.An ambitious objective for the schedule is essential.I do not consider this to be too bold, if we assume that in 2020 there will be no more introductions to water and that we will strive for zero level in relation to contamination and the emission toxic substances.It is about doing what is technically possible, of course not more, but we have to be sufficiently ambitious.I would like to go into a problem that has already been addressed.In my opinion, the environmental committee has made the question of redistribution of water too tight.This is not just a problem in Spain, it is also due in the Nordic countries.I sincerely hope that national solutions will be trusted here, provided that they are better from an environmental and economic policy perspective than the solutions provided for in the directive.President, Ms. Commissioner!I would like to congratulate Ms. Lienemann on an excellent work.Water and air surround us everywhere.We share them with all the people on earth.Water is a prerequisite for human life that is more and more popular.Ms. Schleicher indicated this morning that clean water was an unrealistic demand.Nothing could be more incorrect!It is unrealistic to gradually worsen the water quality and thus the prerequisites for life.This is particularly unrealistic for agriculture, which is most dependent on a clean nature and clean natural riches.That is why I would like to appeal to the MPs of this parliament, to see that a clean environment is the greatest realism in the long term.Mr. President, we - and that also applies to me personally - support Ms. Lienemann's report as well as the goals set there and the guideline for debate.Nevertheless, we should take a closer look at some aspects.For example, the redirection of rivers and the build -up of water through lakes are major problems, alleged development projects, which in reality actually cause considerable dangers for the groundwater, the groundwater level and the surface waters.Regardless of whether we will ultimately agree on who can decide such diversions, the regulations must apply equally to everyone and are extremely strictly applied.In my opinion, the jumping point, Ms. Commissioner, is the planning of the restoration of the groundwater level and the natural river runs as well as the natural state of the lakes, which can be achieved within the time frame of ten years.Such projects should certainly be granted so that they can be funded financially, because ultimately such a restoration could prove to be a very excellent development policy measure.Mr. President, basically this is a good measure.It specifies realistic norms on which the principles of subsidiarity and the management of the water catchment areas are based.It pursues the right goal, which consists in the guarantee of good water quality for humans and animals, for the environment and economic purposes.The avoidance of water pollution and the deterioration in water quality, as well as the ability of the management at times of dryness and flooding, are desirable goals.	de
She was placed in the hands of a single commission member, Mr. Antonio Vitorino, and we are also happy about it.He has also been transferred to the draft of an indicator that enables the progress to be determined, which in this area at the community level, but also - and that seems important to me - were really achieved at the level of the Member States.We are happy and congratulate the advice on these decisions, although Amsterdam's contract included a disappointment for this parliament: the five -year -old postponement with regard to the perception of our role, our possibility of active participation, the democratic control of this space of law, freedom and security as well as the role of the Court of Justice, which this must play in it.However, if we leave the field of great explanations and consider the truly and realized resolutions when examining the progress in 1999, how to meet this parliament through the mandate of the contract, the panorama becomes pretty dark, Mr. President.It is as if the council has more than one face and two hands, and what one signs and explains the other.Despite all the obligations received at the highest level, the Council did not have to take the decisions that he had intended to grasp himself.The programs are becoming increasingly numerous and overlap, and there is no way to check the degree of implementation and effectiveness, or at least it is not possible for this parliament.We have put a number of inquiries to the Council, and I know that the Portuguese presidency is willing to answer each one.We hope that this presidency will initiate a change in the hiring of the council to this parliament.I said there was no relation between the decisions made by the Council and the really realized policies.There are doubts in my faction and in this plenary, for example on a topic that should be good news: the agency of Schengen.Schengen has been integrated into the acquis - we said before, but this was done in a very little transparent frame.No information, no request was received during this process in the European Parliament, neither about the association of the United Kingdom nor about the inclusion of Greece and nor about negotiations with Norway or Iceland.The same is to be said in relation to immigration policy.We drove ourselves to the development of mountains of reports, but we do not know what happened to these initiatives, they have disappeared.We hope that 2000 will be the year of realizations, as was the year of expectations in 1999.And we hope that the Council is willing to accommodate the control of this high house.The Council has decided that the judicial and domestic policy should be part of the House of the Union.The Council can act according to its decisions or further shaken off the inclusion of the other institutions into this vital project.When he chooses the second way, he must know that this bird risks and weakens the basics on which the space of freedom, security and law is based.	de
One of the reasons we were very interested in presenting it was that, we like it or not, the European Union is known for fraud and poor administration.Sometimes it is exaggerated about it, but it is.We have to do something about it.Some of the measures that we have adopted in the past have not been applied by some member states ... and we must not forget that the Member States are responsible for the approximately 80%application of the EU budget.Many of them have not signed, they have not ratified the agreement on the protection of the financial interests of European communities, so it was clear that something more radical had to be done.We must take this task seriously.It is necessary that people who commit fraud against the European Union can be processed.The question is: Who processes?That is when we really find difficulties.Who corresponds to that task when it comes to an organ that crosses so many borders?We must also be sensitive to the concerns of the Member States.The proposal for the creation of a European Fiscal Ministry is very delicate.We all know that a totally federal approach and a situation in which a European judicial authority has priority over national judicial authorities is a too advanced step for some.But it is necessary to initiate the debate about it, so we are going to ask the CIG to start the debates about it.Of the greatest importance for Parliament, as custodian of the European Union budget, it is how to address the issue of people working in the European Union institutions.At a time when we are examining the entire reform process, it is of decisive importance that we send the close signal.Citizens must understand that, if they commit fraud, they will be processed and at this time it is not.Mrs. Palacio has exposed in general the question of whether we have the legal authority to do so.I would like to say clearly that my group will propose an amendment to suppress details about how the commission should address that issue.We know that it is a delicate debate.We know that the commission may need a margin to negotiate a situation that was acceptable to all parties.Let me say clearly that in this case it is not a commitment to a corpus juris, a commitment to a federal European prosecutor.But of a clear commitment to change the status quo, which is totally unacceptable.Mr. President, I would like to start congratulating Mrs. Theato for her report.I think it is a great report that will largely be supported by my parliamentary group.I only have the feeling that deep down she wanted to have yet gone a little further in this stadium.Taking into account the debates of the last five, six months, it could have been the case.We all know that in 1995 it was agreed that a better criminal protection of the financial interests of the Union had to be implemented.	es
I refer to the intention expressed by Cuba, on February 2, to integrate as a full member in the ACP countries.In the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, a Cuban delegation participated and vice chancellor Dalmau appeared before the Plenary, with whom a living debate occurred to which numerous conversations followed with many of us.After Nassau, a delegation of our Parliament, headed by Mr. Corrie himself and by the president of the Development and Cooperation Commission, Joaquín Miranda, visited Havana, producing a series of exchanges of very clarifying opinions.I have the impression that this mission of the European Parliament was the final push that convinced our Cuban friends of the appropriate to step forward in the mechanisms of cooperation with the European Union.We are facing a situation of remarkable political importance and I hope that from the European Parliament we will promote the relevant favorable vision and a generous attitude by the Union, which within the shortest period involves a positive response to the aspirations of Cuba.That will be important, at least for three reasons.It will be in the first place for Cuba, for the development and prosperity of its people and to definitely break the blockade imposed by the United States, which has been repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations.Secondly, we must keep in mind that Cuba's candidacy has been led by all ACP countries.If from the European Union, the recommendation of our associates is positively answered, we will be giving proof of respect and consideration towards said associates that will have positive effects throughout the framework of our cooperation with them.Nor can the value of a decision like the one I propose be ignored, as proof of coherence and autonomy of the European Union and its non -repeditation at any pressure.Accepting Cuba in the ACP community we will demonstrate that we are not a Europe immersed in the unworthy dynamics of paying but not playing, and that when we outraged ourselves before nonsense such as the Helms-Burton law we did not do it hypocritically but willing to act until the last consequences.In a few weeks the ACP-EU parity assembly will meet again and I am sure that this issue will be addressed in its bosom.It would be desirable that, in that procedure, the representation of the European Parliament lends its support for Cuban intentions as the parliamentary colleagues of the ACP countries will.Cuba must comply, naturally, with all the planned conditions as well as any other partner.That is known by Cubans and surely assume it.It must also be clear that Cuba is not going to be asked more than what has been requested to other interlocutors.Welcome to the will of adhesion of Cuba and welcome be Cuba to this circle of ours.I say it with all my heart but also with the deep conviction that, as well as the blockade has only produced misery and, as a consequence of it, tension and hardening by the Cubans, the integration that we are supporting here and the prosperity fruit of it will result in the distension and openness that we all want and of which all, especially the people of Cuba, we will benefit.	es
We took fifteen years for the economic and monetary union.We can take fifteen years for defense and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear.I also think that you should not undervalue, this is a question that I ask you, the stranglehold and the strength of the lobbies of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs.We know the strength they have acquired during these forty years of community construction.Today, they would have everything to lose a communitarization of foreign policy, and I think they work in this sense.Finally, on the question of Kosovo - Mr. Cohn -Bendit was right to insist on this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raises the question of the final status of this territory.Without this status, there will be only instability, murders, provocations on the part of Belgrade, and the European Union should be said on that urgently.Finally, I thank Mr. Poettering because I believe that the initiatives of Belgium, as they say in a little clear language, are starting to do well.I think that many Member States, among the fourteen other Member States, would have many reasons not to collaborate in the European Union meetings in matters of justice, for example.Four years from the arrest of Mr. Dutroux and others, we still have no trials, we still do not know what is happening.In terms of tourism too, many would be, among these fourteen member states, those which could question the opportunity to discourage the holidays of parents with young children in Belgium, for example.So, it is time, and I invite Mr. Solana and Mr. Patten, to share with the colleague, Mr. Michel, that perhaps, he does a little too much and that ultimately it risks, which I hope, to turn against him.Mr. President, I would first like to wish a very good March 1 to Mr. Solana, when a whole series of structures relating to European security and defense policy have been started.But I wonder to tell the truth, what he thinks.In the documents, there is a question of good collaboration with the high representative.You even said earlier that you discussed it during lunch;It would still be the height that you did not discuss it and that there is no good collaboration between the new structures and you!But don't you suffer from not chairing these structures yourself and not being at the center?I would like - like more than one within the Parliament, in my opinion - that you are the engine of these structures and that you do not risk being dismissed in any way.In recent months, especially during discussions with the members of the NATO assembly, the High representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have endeavored to delimit the defense policy of the European Union and that of NATO.	fr
I have to recognize the immense work that you have done: the close rhythm of the meetings, the efforts made to establish a quick intervention force, the concrete actions aimed at preventing, management or resolution of crises through civil means and, where necessary, military.I would like to take advantage of his presence to ask them two questions that pertain to the contents of future actions.The first concerns the next European councils of June and December as well as the extraordinary Council of Lisbon.What are the fundamental and priority developments that would like to see made during the next leaders?And above all, what does it need most of these leaders?My second question is different, although it is somehow connected to the previous one.It concerns the next cig.Do you do not believe that the agenda of the CIG must contemplate the question of European security and defense policy in order to complete the treaties, if it should emerge that the current formulation of texts does not allow the implementation of an authentic defense policy?I believe that the president of the Italian Council raised this point during your meeting on February 24th.Can you illustrate your position on it?Mr. President, Bosnia and Kosovo have awakened Europe.The European Union finally recognizes that it cannot allow itself to always leave the political and military initiative to the Americans.The decision to create its own peace strength is excellent.However, if Europe, in a crucial moment, wants to be able to intervene on the military level, it is necessary to insert a flexibility clause in the treaty.Mr. Solana can play an important role.He is not a madman, certainly not.He is a busy and competent man.However, it is necessary to ask yourself if this accumulation of functions is not excessive compared to its skills.In addition to being a secretary general of the Council, Mr. Solana is a secretary general of UEO and high representative for foreign policy.He also holds the function of head of the political planning unit and prealling unit.Submerged by all these tasks, will he find time to rest, Mr. President?I believe that, from a democratic point of view, this accumulation of functions is substantially unacceptable, especially if we consider that Mr. Solana is not a democratically elected politician, but a high -level official who is not called to account for his work in front of any parliamentary assembly.His position threatens to overshadow that of Commissioner Patten, as it was also remembered today.The impression is that, with the development of European security and defense policy, the Commission and Parliament find themselves excluding from this process.I believe that this exclusion is also unacceptable.Evidently nothing should be left out that can make European politics more efficient, but this cannot lead to an undesirable concentration of power.Mr. Solana must awaken Europe without being caught by tiredness himself.Mr. President, the European Union was created first of all for peace.I am pleased that Commissioner Patten and Mr. Solana have underlined it several times.	it
"The environmental bodies are often without cognitions and procedures for the integration of such a dimension in their daily work.Of course, I want to know if the commissioner lady is willing to integrate the size of equality in environmental policy and environmental programs.I consider it important.If the entire policy has to be pervaded, I consider it to be fundamental that the high managers make this basic notion their own.It is natural that, in my vision of mainstreaming, it must pervade all our work.In the plan in processing at my General Management, equality issues play an essential role.I am willing to activate myself personally, for example acting as a moderator in seminars on the management or other themes in order to encourage women to take on a growing number of tasks within the commission.To motivate everyone, I consider the utmost importance that this message is transmitted through the entire hierarchy, you want from top to bottom, you want from the bottom up.My conception of environmental commitment in general is that this often constitutes a prerogative from women.Since it is necessary to ensure its diffusion, women must also have the opportunity to hold managerial positions or in any case higher in the work of the environment.I repeat that our action plan takes into account, but it is certainly possible to do more.I have some experience in the formulation and application of plans in general.So I hope I can make me useful.Question n.43 of the honorable (H-0045/00): object: the estuary of the Boyne river and the company of the Port of Drugaa The region of the Estuary of the Boyne river has already been designated special protection zone (ZPS) pursuant to the Directive on wild birds and, since it is an area of ​​international importance, is currently at the exam to be designated special conservation area pursuant to the habitat directive.However, the Department of the Navy, the Council of the County of Louth and the ""Druggeda Corporation"" company have authorized the construction of a new port in the ZPS, and even the elimination of a mud plain located near Stegrennan which has been recently integrated into the ZPS on the specific insistence of the Commission.In addition, a huge deposit has been erected - regarding which it is proving to be difficult to obtain acex to the relevant building license - and the ""Drug Correction"" is planning the construction of other infrastructures.In what way can the commission ensure that this type of development, financed through structural funds, is not in conflict with the needs of conservation of nature in the region?Is it the commission willing to completely suspend funding, waiting for a review of the development plans concerning this area?The Commission is aware of the construction of the port, but has no information on deposits, nor on the other infrastructures appointed by the honorable parliamentary.The realization of the port is financed by the structural funds and substantially entails the dredging of the Estuary of the Boyne river and the temporary deposit of the dredging residues on the mud plain located near Stregrennan.The region of the Estuary of the Boyne river is classified as a special protection area pursuant to the wild bird directive.This implies that, for each exploitation activity conducted in the river summer or in its vicinity such as to be able to affect the special protection area, it is necessary to comply with the provisions for the safeguarding of the sanctioned area with the Community directive on habitats."	it
You have the good, charming idea that the result and yardstick for your policy and for your five -year program would be the election result or participation in the next European elections.When I imagine that I do not see your work program to my voters, which I see weekly and to whom I have to explain this weekly - not in the high ranks of important politics, but on the street - then I ask what should I say then?Mr. Prodi, what should I say what is new about it?Nothing is new to your work program.They needed 12 pages for five years, they needed 18 pages for a year of work program.Does that make me hopeful for the year 2000?No, that doesn't make me!In your 2000 work program you say something very clever.You say that environmental interests have to be integrated into all other policy areas.Did you do that, Mr. Prodi, and have you read your work program of the year?You didn't do it!You have not integrated environmental policy into the expansion, although it will be one of the core problems when it comes to expansion.You have also not integrated them into economic policy, competition or internal market.You have not done that anywhere.They put together individual set pieces, but they have not formed any overall structure.If you said in your speech beforehand, a disaster like that of the Danube must be a reason for a disaster program - no, Mr. Prodi, we have to finally start implementing legislation and also ensuring the control of the legislation.In your five -year program, you write that the people of the European Union rightly expect better food standards and better food legislation.Mr. Prodi, you don't know what you are talking about!The legislation of the European Union for food is the most ambitious in the world!What is Hapert and what is missing is the implementation in member countries and control.Finally take your task seriously to pull the Member States on the ears as President of the Commission and to force their tasks and their duty!They should not always only maintain hobbies, but do their daily normal work.We expect you to do this in the next five years!President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen!As the chairman of the fishing committee of this parliament, Mr. Prodi does not make things easy for me.I see myself forced to reprimand the lack of fishing in the program that you have presented to us.The next five years of the Prodi Commission - they ceremoniously announce it in the first of their conclusions - will be shaped by major changes.I hope that this change announced by you, according to your pitiful and absolute silence in your program, does not exist in an even greater exclusion of fishing.Not a single line, not a single word about fishing or the GFP.I do not ask you to find any details or precise information, but I think a mention would be necessary.How can you forget a common - I emphasize common - politics of such economic, social and regional effects - therefore with consequences for the economic and social cohesion of Europe - completely forgotten?	de
In this phase I limit myself to saying that I hope that it is integrated in the programming of the rural areas of the target 2, as well as the Feaog, orientation section, is integrated in the regions of the objective 1. In any case, I took note of how vigilant the commission for agriculture and rural development on these issues is.Before concluding, I would like to say to the honorable Savary that the discussion specifies on the consequences of the storms that have fallen in recent weeks on France, Austria and Germany in particular is scheduled for tomorrow, as well as the discussion with my colleague, Mrs. Commissioner De Palacio, on the lessons to be drawn from the black tide that hit the French coast.With his permission, honorable Savary, I reserve the right to express my position on this issue, which coincides widely with the recommendation that you have formulated on how much it can be done to fight against the black tide in the context of lens 2. I remember that tomorrow the Commission will approve the paper of the areas recognized as objective 2 for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg, which will provide us with a work tool, in particularDepartments affected by storms.Here is the reason why after tomorrow I will go to visit in the two French departments seriously damaged by bad weather.In conclusion I thank the president for his understanding and the rapporteur for the quality of his work and his parliamentary commission and I also want to say that, regardless of some difference in evaluation on the role of the guidelines, - we have discussed and I tried to clarify my point of view - I am very happy with the support expressed by this Parliament in favor of the processing by the commission of the directors subjected to the Member States in order to prepare national programs.This can only comfort the conception based on the good practices taken from the experience of the programs for the period 1994-1999.I seem to be a good omen for a valid cooperation between our two institutions, at the time of starting the programming for 2000-2006, a good practice of work in common, consolidated, honorable Hatzidakis, from respect for the code of conduct that imposes itself on our two institutions and which is particularly close to me.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, at 12.00.Situation, social and economic development of the regions of the Union, the agenda bears the report (A5-0107/1999) of the Honorable Berend, on behalf of the Commission for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report relating to the socio -economic situation and the development of the regions of the European Union (SEC (99) 0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123 (COS).Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, the sixth periodic report on the situation and social and economic development of the European Union regions marks an important step in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress carried out in this field after the publication of the fifth periodic report.However, I believe that talking about a true convergence of medium regional development in Europe offers a somewhat mona image of reality, and unfortunately this is precisely the message transmitted by the press and proclaimed in some speeches.	it
"We must give a satisfactory answer.The case of Flora Brovina is never just one case.We are very mentioning it in the draft resolution but there are hundreds, thousands of Flora Brovina.I ask the commission and the council absent to finally do something for these political prisoners.The fact that they are incarcerated in Serbia contributes to the foundations of disorder and violence in Kosova.Mr. President, in his paragraph 10, the project of common resolution which is presented to us strongly enjoins the Council and the Member States of the European Union to redouble their efforts in order to make available to the United Nations police forces the staff and the necessary means.This request is in full agreement with the opinion of the high representative of the United Nations in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner.To fulfill his mission of restoring and maintaining public order in Kosovo, he believes that he needs at least 6,000 foreign police officers.The United Nations promised him the sending of a police force of 4,800 men.To date, Kouchner can only have 2,000 police officers.In addition, half of this group is from the United States and Germany.It is logical that the high representative of the UN in Kosovo is largely unhappy with this situation, especially if we take into account the endemic ethnic violence in this region.However, the lively reproaches that Kouchner addresses in recent days to the French government are astounding.Paris completely abandons his compatriot in the region by granting him a handful of police officers, no more than 37. According to Kouchner, the culprit of this unworthy position of France is none other than the Minister of the Interior, Jean-Pierre Chevènement.Still according to Kouchner, he would hinder the sending of French police officers to Kosovo for ideological reasons.I ask the Council and the Commission to deeply examine these serious accusations and to inform the European Parliament about it.Freedom of the press in Angola Mr. President, I will not repeat the premise of earlier: I could be accused of abusive advertising.On the question ""Angola"", I think that a first result is to finally have a resolution.It hadn't happened in our parliament for a very long time.So I greet it as such.I believe that the European Union and the West, in general, have been taking, for some time, Mr. Savimbi under their crossed shots, without any discrimination, but that corruption is now such in Mr. Dos Santos' regime that even his long -standing friends are starting to help to do as if they saw nothing.So, I believe that it is urgent to come to be able to make a general political resolution, where we could go to the bottom of things, in particular also on fairly disturbing things, of which we speak, in particular a given logistical support, at the level of intelligence services, by the United States and by Great Britain, the generalized corruption of the regime linked to multinational oil companies, and many other things, certainly very ""tasty""deepen."	fr
Mr. President, Mrs. curator, the measures provided for in this Directive cover from the elaboration of water management plans, broad rights of information and consultation, and greater cooperation between the Member States, to the fight against water pollution for particular harmful substances.Knowing the years that this camera has been trying to get a framework of these characteristics, I congratulate myself that today we have reached this point and I would like to congratulate Mrs. Lienemann, who has been fortunate to present this report today.However, it also seems extremely important to verify an aspect that many consider, in fact, obvious.Still I would like to highlight it.The directive does not offer any legal base, in any way, to divert water from the territory of a Member State against its will.In order to confirm once again this point, I have presented an amendment - with great support from the PPE, that I appreciate - and it would be a great satisfaction for me that it obtained the affirmative vote of the Assembly tomorrow.Its purpose is to make it clear that the water - as it has already been repeatedly highlighted today - is not a current merchandise, but a good that belongs to the population of the corresponding Member State of the Union and that it must receive a protection and treatment that this fact takes into account.I know, and the speaker that has preceded me has stressed, that some states of the European Union have water problems.I believe that all of us have the possibility of better managing water in our countries and promoting less pollutant use of water.No country can be exempt from this effort.Only when each country has made the maximum effort to conserve its water resources, when in the country itself it has really been done as much as it could be done, only then we can contemplate, in my opinion, a solidarity of water, if necessary.Mr. President, Mrs. curator, should be a reason for joy that the second reading of this directive was already on the table.However, I have to say that I am not very happy because I think it is a directive that does not have great quality, that it will raise many application problems and that it has many deficiencies.First, I think it is an excessively hard and simplistic directive, reductionist.No other directives have been fulfilled many times that already existed regarding water and governments and the commission on many occasions have not imposed discipline as they should have done it, although I know it is not pleasant.It is not a matter of having a much harder regulation because the problems in many cases are management, of assuming the powers that one has and not transferring to the legislative the big problems that the water system has, whose complication we all know.A reductionist directive has been made;They cannot be put in the same sack countries that have navigable rivers along with others that have water, whose land opens with large cracks because they lack it and that are at 55º or 60º in the sun.	es
But from the political side you have to restore control properly.We must also restore the commission triangle, council and parliament in the field of foreign and security policy where so far it takes too much on the side of the Council and here especially in relation to the rude measures of crisis management in which the powers are exclusively of the commission.All this has not been sufficiently introduced into this global concept.We have to examine whether in this aspect it is not necessary to introduce changes within the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference.The Portuguese Presidency of the Council has said yes, which will reconsider about it to eventually achieve an extension of the mandate.I want to attract attention to another important point.The debates that we maintain these days, for example, on the government of a country in Europe show, however, that we have to reflect the moral orientation of the rule of law and common welfare of the European Union and, which also for this reason, must be introduced in the treaty legally binding fundamental rights because this will be a decisive stabilizing element.I pray to those who still maintain great reservations in this regard that reconsider if it is not now the time to see it also in this context and perhaps have the necessary value to promote the fundamental rights in this field in this field.The European Union does not need or barely needs new instruments or new powers.What you need are the instruments to use your competences.For this reason, we have to adopt the necessary measures so that the instruments will serve so that we can fulfill in the name of the citizens the tasks that the treaty is formally recognized.I think that the efforts of this intergovernmental conference should be especially concentrated at this point.If we achieve progress in this field then we can face more guarantees to the historical task of the expansion of the European Union.This is the decisive point.Honorable Presidency of the Council, I am convinced that under its direction it will be possible to configure positively.Mr. President of the Council, you have been able to understand, hearing several interventions, which, within the Constitutional Affairs Commission and also at the level of the presidents of the political groups of this Parliament, has prevailed, not without differences, the idea of ​​trusting in the Portuguese presidency and not increasing their difficulties by postponing the beginning of the intergovernmental conference.I can assure you that it has not been easy to achieve it last week within the commission that presides, however, in the end, we have decided to bet on the Portuguese presidency and we would really want to win the bet.You have told us about the beginning of your tour of the different capitals and has told us about the difficulties of some states to reach a consensus in your countries and, therefore, in your parliaments.I want to keep you in mind that yesterday we have had one day, I think, very interesting debate and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments that were represented by qualified and committed delegations.	es
We are after the stability of the financial markets, not because it is the goodwill of the financial markets, but because it is also of our growth, our investments, our jobs within the European Union.In this regard, we must ask ourselves which instruments we have to effectively generate a certain order, which is lacking so far.We have all contributed to the liberalization of financial transactions;To date, however, we do not have any regulatory framework that works and we have experienced it bitter experience with the repercussions of crises in Asia and Latin America.It is therefore more than time than we plan, Primo, control rules and, Secundo, the transparency of the financial markets and the information relating to it.It is important that we know the actors and their solvency.We must also ask ourselves if there is not a requirement for tax justice.At a time when, both European and international, the tax burden weighing on the work factor is increasing, we must question how to achieve effective taxation of capital income and, in this area, we must also question the taxation of short -term financial transactions.I believe that it is really important to have a meticulous report and conclusions of the Commission so that we can see, as a European Parliament, if the European Union must not ensure, in concert with the USA and Japan, to actually achieve international solidarity in order to increase the stability and security of the economy and the financial markets.This is the intention that underlies this oral question and we will have to, within the Parliament, within the framework of the regulatory procedures passing through the commissions and the plenary meetings, to reach a balanced and really carrier proposal for the future.Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, I must express, on behalf of the group of the European Party of Liberals Democrats and Reformers, my surprise in the face of the debate which currently occupies us on international capital flows and their possible tax tax.Although this is not mentioned in the text, it looks like an attempt to resuscitate, as was done in the introduction, the question of the tax proposed a few years ago by Mr. Tobin, to which our group opposed in a clear and categorical manner, during the previous legislature with a series of arguments exposed with clarity and coherence by our president, Mr. Cox.Arguments that, modestly, I will have to repeat during my intervention since the question rests.We do not agree with this type of taxation because its application, provided that it is possible, would not serve the objectives that Mr. Tobin presented in his time and that the left of this assembly seems to want to resuscitate.First of all, there is no evidence that the taxation of the international flow of capital could reduce the risk of volatility or instability of international markets.On the contrary, as it is certain that not all countries accept it, we would open a path to speculation and fraud, which would cause volatility, instability, insecurity, opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services which operate internationally.In addition, the idea of ​​obtaining resources in order to use them for economically more needy countries is so complex, when you think of its application in practice, that it is simply impossible.	fr
"The second problematic aspect concerns the data to be collected according to the regulation.First, as regards economic data, amendment no.2 provides two changes.The first is aimed at ensuring that the collected data are limited to the objective to be pursued.The second modification consists in replacing the reference to sales products and other financial revenues, subsidies, interest collected, etc., with a simple reference to the volume of sales.It is thought that without these changes the Member States may have to bear too high costs for the collection of data and the problem of confidentiality would also be presented.In line with these changes, in amendment no.5 The reference to accounting items has been suppressed.Secondly, as regards environmental data, the original proposal only speaks of biological and economic information.The Commission, however, clarified that it intends to engage in studies and more wider pilot projects in the environmental field and that it may want to expand the series of data collected by the Member States at a later time.Amendment no.3 The data necessary to monitor the changes of aquatic ecosystems is included in the regulation.This obviously will facilitate the introduction of a new regulation on environmental data, and could even make it useless.It should be noted that the amendment does not oblige the Commission in any way to include the collection of such data neither in the minimum program nor in the extended program, but gives the Commission the possibility of doing it.As has already been said, the Council decision proposal can be divided into two parts.The first concerns the financing of the Member States for the application of Community programs.The second provides that the commission itself can finance studies and pilot projects.There are some amendments of minor importance, such as amendment no.2, aimed at ensuring that the financial contribution to the Member States can cover not only the costs of the collection of data, but also those of their management, compilation, aggregation, etc.The amendments nos.3 and 6 aim to accelerate the times of application of the regulation and to allow Member States to know the content of the programs as soon as possible.Furthermore, these amendments aim to align these implementing times with the dates and with the regulation.The amendments nos.4 and 5 are aimed at ensuring that financial information is continuously provided to the budget authority.More in particular, through amendment no.1, the Commission for Fishing welcomes the recommendation of the Commission for Budgets that asked to put the funding under the 1b address book instead of under the book 3 of the financial perspectives.Although in the preliminary budget draft the Commission had placed the allocations in the 3 ""internal policies"" section, Parliament created the new Budget item B1-500 to finance the measures we are discussing, in order to ensure that the necessary resources continue to be available.Mr. President, I consider it appropriate to fully agree with the honorable Attwoll who, at the beginning of his excellent report, said that the two proposals of the Commission, aimed at knowing more in depth the scientific and socio -economic situation of the fishing sector, arrive at a critical moment."	it
"Mrs. President, Mr. President of the Commission, we can tell us satisfied with the global scope of the announced objectives, which are commensurate with the challenges that Europe will have to face.I see that she believes that the fall of the Berlin Wall is the essential element of this end of the century.It is an event that preludes the expansion.Rather than using this word ""expansion"", I would almost want to talk about reunification, a term that seems to me full of a much greater political meaning.You resume the idea of ​​concentrating your activities on the most important missions;It is a goal of your reform and, in essence, to apply the principle of subsidiarity.Clearly apply this principle will promote the actions conducted by giving citizens a clear image of every level of competence to citizens.Prodi president, between saying and doing there is the sea in the way!She will have to fight against the typical trend of institutions to try to expand her powers.I will judge accordingly on the facts.And, while waiting, I give my approval and encouragement to the will that clearly transpires from its communication.However, there are two essential points: the simplification and application of Community law.During 1998, 123 appeals were presented to the Court of Justice for non -application or transposition;25 percent of the directives of the environmental sector are not applied or implemented.The facts of recent times shows us the absolute need.Community law must not remain inapplicated because it is too complex or quibble.The union must not give in to this bad habit and, even on this topic, I am sorry that its communication does not go out enough in detail.She expresses herself in realistic terms on the impossibility for the assistance state to give adequate answers to today's problems, among which unemployment includes.Nonetheless I'm sorry that a clear alternative has not been proposed.It would have been correct to underline the refusal of any welfare policy, accompanied, however, by the enhancement of the spirit of initiative and responsibility.You do not mention the aging of our population which will have substantial repercussions on the structure of our society, not only from an economic point of view, but also in terms of public health.In fact, it is a silent revolution and, from this point of view, I expected more from its communication.Finally, you insist on European research as a central element of our future, without however indicating the tools it intends to implement.Ethical principles are also at the center of this research, but his communication does not say it.Mr. President, you intend to better inform the citizens: meanwhile, with enhancing ties with Parliament, because we are the representatives of citizens.Lady president, honorable colleagues, you can only share the general guidelines of the five -year program and the program for the year 2000, illustrated with a lot of passion by President Prodi this morning.In the two documents, a strong emphasis was placed on the need to define new forms of European governance and to put in this purpose, for this purpose, a new agenda of the Commission, defining more stringent priorities in pursuing the objective of full employment, through a more effective coordination of the economic and social policies of the States and - I allow myself to underline it - first of all of the nations that have joined the monetary Union and that must be put in a condition of constituting the first example of cooperation.strengthened."	it
By placing finance in first place, this movement has strengthened the needs of profitability and the management conditions everywhere.In this perspective, the mergers, acquisitions, corporate renovations, the collection of enormous resources on the financial markets that continues to grow are placed.Unemployment and pressure on the workers of the whole world tend to accentuate.Markets and real growth are hindered.The influx or brutal withdrawal of speculative capital threatens the economies of numerous countries, until the sinking, as happened in Asia, Russia or Brazil.Faced with this neoliberal world championship, under the dominion of the financial markets, the need, testified by our request, of another idea of ​​the world according to which the common law would be that dictated by the duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world grows.Nobody can ignore the challenge of civilization consisting of the lack of almost a billion jobs.The need to allow unprecedented efforts regarding development, access to knowledge.In this regard, all ideas deserve to be taken into consideration and we think that that of the Tobin tax constitutes an important proposal, like other forms of conceivable transactions.The tax in question can contribute to curbing speculation, without penalizing the activities of the real economy, and would allow new resources for investments in human resources and this when the PSNU evaluates 40 billion dollars a year the sum necessary to eradicate poverty, allow access of all drinking water, to meet healthcare needs.When the discussion on the ability or not that politics has been initiated on a planetary level, it has to influence the economic sphere, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political will of reconquest of the democratic spaces confiscated by international financial operators.I would like to respond to the commissioner who said that to reach this result a minimum number of industrial countries is needed.It seems to me that the European Union is made up of an adequate number of industrial countries and I think, such as the honorable Désir and several other deputies who intervened, that the European Union formed by us can take the initiative on the matter.In any case, I believe that the European Parliament would be honored to echo the will of citizens to control the world in the sense of well -being for everyone.Lady president, I too rejoice in the development of this discussion for too long.In fact, we know that each generation, over time, has blindly entrusted itself to what could be defined as a dominant ideology, i.e. a series of accepted prejudices as such by general conformism and which, however, end up revealing to subsequent generations as much as they were full of dramas.The free exchange and the constant exaltation of the World Cup constitute, in our opinion, the dominant ideology of today, that is, the serious mistake of this end of the century, as dangerous as much as it was once the ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or, even before, the certainty erected to Dogma according to which the earth was flat.	it
I am sure that, with the mood that they have shown here today, the first thing that will happen, in this new climate of understanding between us, is that they will take into consideration the proposal for resolution that we will submit to them.Question Shift (Council) In accordance with the agenda, we proceed to the question shift (B5-0003/2000).We will examine the questions addressed to the Council.QUESTION Nº 1 Asked by (H-0780/99): Subject: Construction of a nuclear power plant in Turkey, vulnerable to the two-year-old two-year-oldThey export to third countries and the EU, cutting their budget, pays for the damages caused by the Ladies.Turk nuclear projects, which ignore the risks involved for the inhabitants and ecosystems of Turkey and the entire region, give rise to suspect that they hide preconceived plans of the Turkish political-military hierarchy to acquire nuclear technology that enables the construction of nuclear weapons, since it is intended to acquire reactors of Canadian origin similar to those who possess India andPakistanWhat measures have you taken or plan to take the advice to avoid nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wants to enter the EU and spend huge sums on nuclear programs, while perceiving European funds as financial aid?Mr. President, the Council wishes to clarify that Türkiye is a signatory to the Nuclear Safety Agreement, whose objectives coincide with the concerns expressed by the honor.Indeed, that agreement, which entered into force on October 24, 1996, is precisely why reach and maintain a high level of nuclear safety worldfacilities.As is known, the agreement also covers the prevention of accidents that have radiological consequences and the attenuation of these consequences when such accidents occur.For the rest, I would like to indicate to the honor that Turkey, as a candidate for adherence to the European Union, must, sooner or later, that is, as a condition prior to adhesion - and I believe that this point is important - to accept within the scope of its own preading strategy a set of policies in order to use, in useful time, to accept the community collection in its integrity, therefore, therefore, all the provisions in force.Thanks for the answer.But I would like to add the following: with this unit, Türkiye intends to increase only its energy potential by 2%.However, it is said that he wants to acquire reactors of the Candu type, the same ones that Pakistan and India acquired, with which they made nuclear weapons.	es
(Applause on the right) It is by diplomacy, persuasion, culture, solidarity, and not by unconstitutional means, that institutions can be respected and enforce the principles.Bilateral relations involve states, the fourteen member states therefore have nothing to do with it.This amounts to replacing European institutions to defend political logics with incompetence worthy of parties barely out of totalitarian systems and not representatives of democratic traditions.As we have already written several times, many things, too many things separate us from Haider, in particular his claims on the Haut-Adige which is very Italian.We knew it.Today, we see with anguish that other representatives of the Union seem to have renounced the democratic role of Europe.We are in favor of legality and democracy expressed by peoples, respect for national sovereignty provided that it does not violate the principles of the treaty or human rights.We believe in Europe, while others seem to have started the union disintegration process.These are the results of hasty enlargement, a lack of clarity in terms of roles and duties.Europe has been created from the circus market, not that of principles, rights and politics.These are the consequences!We can therefore only invite the Commission to continue on the path of moderation and to support those who work so that the autonomy and sovereignty of the Austrian people are respected, while ensuring that these people remain free and united towards others.Madam President, dear colleagues, we have an appointment today with hypocrisy.We have a council which managed to ignore the treaty and to use a method completely outside of article 6 and article 7 which allowed, in the event of serious and persistent violations, to condemn a state.In this case, there are no serious and persistent violations in Austria.There are risks - we are all aware of this - but there is absolutely, as it stands, no violation of neither serious or persistent.If we were to apply the criteria of article 6 and article 7, if we were to apply the criteria of Copenhagen to our institutions, to the European Union, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, as requested from the countries of Eastern Europe.And if we are talking about serious and persistent violations, we can perhaps speak of certain Member States, we can speak of Italy and France, respectively first and third country sentenced by the Council of Europe, by the Strasbourg Court.We can speak, dear Belgian colleagues, of Belgium, of the Dutroux affair, dozens and dozens of children removed, tortured, raped, murdered by personalities from this country and whose surveys are enclosed, always sagged.We could, dear colleagues, a third of the deputies, impose on the board and the commission to wonder about it.We could question the fact that the Austrians reject ten years, thirteen years of particracy which has corrupted and rotten a country - Austria - as it is to rot and corrupt countries like Italy, Belgium and other member countries of the Union.	fr
Therefore, we will try to be perfectly clear about how and when to apply it.President, curator, communication states, in reference to the relationship between science on the one hand and the resource at the beginning of caution for another, that the invocation of the precautionary principle always requires a political decision when scientific evidence is missing.In this way, enough power is put in the hands of science.We can ask ourselves what kind of scientists will facilitate that documentation and what do they defend?In the communication it also states that there is a sufficiently recognized minority of scientists to invoke the precautionary principle.I would like to ask you what is the definition of a recognized minority?How do you define it?And how do you get to a recognized minority?If it is a political decision I would like to ask you: Who will make that political decision?The commission?The advice?To what extent will the European Parliament have a role in it?What is the role of scientific committees?What will be the role of the authorities in the field of food that you are going to establish?As an end point, will all decision -making be done in a transparent way, and publicly?Those are my three questions..(En) Yes, Mr. President, that's true.There are many aspects that are difficult and not always perfectly clear, but I will try to answer some questions.Who will make the decision, who are responsible for decision making?Well, that depends on who legislators are.It is part of the management of risk factors.It is necessary to analyze, for example, the degree of concern of society in relation to a specific issue and judge based on scientific evidence in some cases.But it is true that it is not necessary for a large majority of the scientific community to resort to the principle of caution.The principle can be used based on the evidence of a minority or in cases where science is incomplete.It is there where we must seek balance between this principle, as a political tool, and science.It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is carried out, but it is not about modifying the scientific foundation.We resort to experts to obtain all possible scientific information before adopting measures;And so it will also be done in the future.We must consider it a tool for the management of risk factors.We must decide whether we want to endanger people, for example, or if we want to protect the environment;and we must study the available scientific data.It is necessary to make an evaluation of all these factors and of scientific evidence.Then we make the decision to take measures or not, to take action or not.Therefore, there is no answer to all your questions, but that does not alter the system of resorting to scientists as we do today or the expert system we currently use.Mr. President, I want to ask a question about a specific and current case, in which the precautionary principle could be applied.	es
"There are two reasons for our refusal.It is, Primo, a terribly complex and very sensitive legal question, and the proposal presents, in my eyes, certain risks for legal certainty which has not been aware.This reason is sufficient in itself to explain our refusal to vote the proposal, but there is a second reason: even if it is an agreement, that is to say a collaboration between states, the proposal gives off very clear trends, namely the creation, in the longer term, of a common European jurisdictional space, a common European penal code and a common common administration of justice.We are opposed to this evolution, we are against this mantra ""a space of freedom, security and justice"", which consists in creating in a barbaric manner of community systems, certain legal traditions linked to these sensitive and important questions, which are above all national prerogatives.Mr. President, I too think that the convention that we examine today is only a small step, still too small, in the construction of this common space of freedom, security and justice that - we hope - Europe will be one day.Europe is today a space for the free movement of goods and people where crime knows no borders, while obstacles that are difficult to overcome still stand on the way to those who have to fight it.A small step - I said - but which is welcome.The Committee on Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Internal Affairs has precisely wanted to prescribe other limits and protections in the name of the defense of the fundamental rights of persons, which are in force in the States and within the Union, even if they are not yet devoted to a Charter of the Rights of the European Union which, we hope, will soon see the light of day: just limits and protections because the rights in forcerespected by all public authorities of all states.In certain passages of the commission's proposals, no doubt we have exaggerated in terms of precautions as when you wanted to give the accused the choice to accept or refuse his temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the requirements of the instruction.Personally, I cannot accept, for example, that Mr. Pinochet is authorized to choose to be transferred or not to Spain for a confrontation.Or, when you wanted the witness or the expert - and not only the person under investigation, the accused - is entitled to a defender for remote interrogations.These are slight faults, not wanted by the rapporteur, to which will remedy - I hope - the vote of this assembly.The rapporteur has done a work worthy of praise, which I take note of which I thank him for.The overall result is appreciable and I hope that the council will take fully into account.Like other deputies have already pointed out, a point - the most delicate - remains unresolved: it is article 18 of the convention concerning the interception of communications which intervene in a Member State, carried out directly by another Member State without requesting mutual aid of the State where the interception takes place, proceedings made possible today thanks to modern technologies."	fr
The European Council of Helsinki approved the enlargement to 13 Member States.There is therefore inconsistency between the opening of membership negotiations with these 13 countries and the wish to proceed only to a minimis reform.As far as we are concerned, located in the logic of the treaty, we want the agenda of the next intergovernmental conference to allow a much deeper reform of the union.That said, Mr. President, the Parliament is holding this debate today because he did not want to delay the start of the conference.Theoretically, we could have done it.We could have voted on the 17th of this month, so that the conference could not have started on the 14th. But we did not want to do so, because we wanted to send a clear political message to governments and countries candidate for membership: we want to carry out this reform to facilitate enlargement.Mr. President, I am delighted to be able to say it to the Portuguese presidency, because she has acquired great esteem in this assembly.The Portuguese presidency shares a number of aspirations of this Parliament and is committed to doing their best so that the agenda of the intergovernmental conference includes other subjects, which are absolutely necessary.I want to say, Mr. President, that this aspiration of the European Parliament is disinterested.The latter, in any case, will be politically reinforced by the treaty from this intergovernmental conference, simply because during this intergovernmental conference, in accordance with what was decided in Helsinki, we will examine which matters currently subject to unanimousness will pass to the qualified majority.The number of matters decided by qualified majority will therefore increase.However, the community acquired already provides that the legislative matters decided by qualified majority will also be subject to the codecision of the Parliament.Consequently, if there is an extension of the qualified majority, there will also be expanding the codecision of the Parliament.But the Parliament would not accomplish its task of supranational European institution if he did not think of the political project of the Union.We are going there.We believe that other questions should be tackled with a view to this Union political project.Among other questions, those linked to integration into the treaty of security and defense problems, subjects that have progressed a lot lately but which should be introduced into the treaty.The same goes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, of course, of which we started the editorial staff yesterday, and I believe that this beginning was carried out in a very positive way.We will work seriously so that Europeans see that being European represents a plus and that European citizen has fundamental rights which bind the institutions of the Union.Consequently, Mr. President, our proposals, which we will concretize in a new report, will constitute, with the proposals of the Commission, which produced an excellent document I am delighted to provide it here to Mr. Barnier, documents of the conference.	fr
But the decision of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best that could be achieved.There are some weaknesses.In my view, the biggest weakness is that the situation of medium -sized companies is not sufficiently taken into account, but the automotive industry does not only consist of large companies.SMEs play a very important role, especially in the supply area, and we also have to take into account the interests of employees in these small and medium -sized companies.Then there are far more than two million people who find their jobs in this area.This situation of medium -sized companies also serve many amendments to the Committee on Environmental Questions, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the present amendments to our faction on Article 5 regarding the costs.The common point of view is also not a glossy performance.There is no look for the big relationships, and if the colleague says of the Greens, it would be the first time that the European Parliament weakens a common point of view, then you cannot say that, because it does not make sense in terms of environmental policy that we are using rigid, high recycled quotas of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-liter car, where a lot of plastic is used!Therefore, one has to support an amendment that at least allows exceptions if we have particularly economical cars.The objections of industry in this area are certainly not illogical.The argumentation force of the plastic and auto industry would also increase if one would not only get involved in the reduction of CO2 in Europe in this context.Mr President, we are currently in an unusual situation: Those who want to work for the environmental values ​​represent the common point of view of the council.In contrast to my previous speaker, I am really proud that we have achieved a common point of view during the Finnish presidency in which the environmental values ​​are defended.When we tip the common point of view and try to share the disposal costs, we create loopholes: we do not bring a reasonable, clear system in which the responsibilities are regulated.Therefore, in my opinion, the main responsibility must be with the manufacturer.This is the only way we can solve the problem sufficiently and also create incentives for the manufacturers to produce vehicles that can be disposed of in the future as cost -effective as possible.President!The council's draft guidelines contains two fundamental problems.On the one hand, this is the unrestricted commitment of the manufacturers to withdraw waste vehicles.Here there is a risk that a monopoly situation will be created in the dismantling of the dismantling, especially in areas with long distances and numerous small businesses dealing with dismantling.I believe that an EU directive, regardless of its content, must not disadvantage medium-sized companies within the Union.The manufacturers' unreserved responsibility also endangers the used goods market, since the manufacturer is obliged to sell new parts to a greater extent.However, this trade is particularly important for those who collect and overtake older vehicles.From a market economy perspective, too, this principle is rather doubtful.Companies must change, have to be sold and liquidated.You have to be able to establish yourself in new markets and also be able to leave old markets.Binding the manufacturers to a responsibility that can extend very far into the past fits badly into a flexible and development -promoting market economy.	de
"First of all, I would like to emphasize that the debate on issues concerning social protection began within European institutions several years ago and that, in 1995, the first communication entitled ""The future of social protection"" arrived, followed by the contributions of Parliament developed by the honorable Weiler and Pronk.Today, in examining the report of Honorable Andersson, I think I can say that we have made great steps forward, since we now talk about modernizing social protection.We must take into account, secondly, the legal basis with which the Commission can operate.As you know, the Treaty does not contemplate a legal basis for policies at European level, but there is a certain consensus, also expressed in the last Council, to undertake coordination actions and exchange of experiences between the Member States regarding the most successful programs.Thirdly, as regards the four aspects on which the communication in question is concentrated, namely the paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social integration and the quality of health, there is a horizontal approach to the female question, given that in each of the four sections, as reported by the honorable deputies, for women there are particular problems that, in many cases, should be addressed with different policies.My next observation concerns the specific actions already undertaken.As we know, the Portuguese presidency has already constituted a high -level group, which will present the first report at the top of next June.The Portuguese presidency focuses on two issues: sustainable pension systems and social integration.I believe that the proposal to constitute a group analogous at a parliamentary level is very positive, because it could help take a further step forward after the approval of its constitution.With regard to many of your observations on the role of social protection systems and the related cost, as well as on the role that these systems have in the framework of the competitiveness of the Member States, I would like to specify that policies try to reconcile competitiveness with social cohesion in Europe.We must certainly take into account competitiveness, but we must also think about the planning of social protection, in order to transform it into a factor of economic growth and employment.I believe this is clear in communication.Ladies deputies, in the coming years, once the unanimous approval of the Council is obtained, the goal will be to achieve a first level made of coordination, exchange of opinions, identification of social problems and creation of a database for better coordination of policies.As reported by many parliamentarians, I think an important step has already been taken: the CIG the issues of social protection will be addressed in depth and will enter a new phase, where social policy will become a truly European policy.Thank you, Mrs. Diamantopoulou.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, at 11.30.Treated OMPI The agenda bears the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) of the honorable Cederschiöld, on behalf of the legal commission and for the internal market, on the proposal for the decision of the Council relating to the approval, in the name of the European Community, of the Treaty of the IMPI on the law and the Treaty of the IMPI on the interpretations and executions and on the phonograms [com (1998) 249 -C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)]."	it
"Thank you very much, Madame Schreyer.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.Votes (Parliament approves the commission's proposal) Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE).(En) Mr. President, it is a procedural motion.I would like to ask you for a clarification concerning the regulation: namely Regulation 133, paragraph 2 and 133, paragraph 4, both relating to the vote.With regard to votes other than votes by nominal appeal, these initially take place by hand and it is only when certain doubts emerge that electronic voting is used.Is it correct?Indeed, dear colleague, I voted by hand, since no group had asked for a vote by nominal appeal.You know that there is no nominal appeal or electronic verification only if colleagues ask for it.In this case, I assure you that there was a vast majority in favor of the directive that we have just voted.Mr. President, I did not refer to this particular vote but to votes in general.It is obvious that some presidents do not take care of the hands, so to speak, and directly proceed to the electronic vote.I was wondering if it was the correct procedure.I know it takes more time but should we not always first vote by hand?Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to this second reading, the Commission can accept the only amendment proposal advanced by the Parliament.The Commission takes up and accepts the amendment proposal.(The President declares approved the common position thus modified) Report (A5-0104/1999) of Mr. Koch, on behalf of the Commission for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council amending Directive 94/55/EC relating to the merger of the laws of the Member States concerning the transport of dangerous goods by road (COM (1999) 0158-C5-0004/1999-1999/0083 (COD)) (Parliament adopts the legislative resolution) Report (A5-0108/1999) of Ms. Schroedter, in the name of the Commission for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on Commission Communication ""Structural funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund.

"I would like to formulate three observations.The first is that a mature dialogue between Council and European Parliament is essential.Just six months have passed since Amsterdam has imposed our two institutions to work together;We studied each other, we had some small bickering, but we actually need to work together.Let's stop not taking things seriously.We abandon the elaborate charades and respect the duties that the treaties impose us and the times granted for a truly democratic discussion.Involve us in your discussions on policy and evolution of the process.We do not pretend that national parliaments can carry out an effective democratic control power of government activities in this sector.My second observation is that a commission with adequate resources is needed.We have constituted a new general management, yet in everything it has only 70 people.There is an agreement that plans to double this number, but as far as I appear so far no new resource has arrived.We are entrusting the commission a very heavy task, not least that of drawing up the scoreboard.Council and Parliament must cooperate to provide the resources that the Commission needs.Finally, regarding the content of the discussion, I willingly welcome the fact that the presidency has placed the space of freedom, security and justice at the top of its program.The three seems to be the number that distinguishes positive things, especially in the European policy sector.Two hundred years ago they were freedom, equality and fraternity and everything went well until the governments of the left made equality prevail over everything else.Now these are freedom, security and justice, and I hope that the current left -wing governments take into account the words of Commissioner Vitore and resist the temptation to raise security, however important it is, above the equally important needs of freedom and justice.Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council and the Commissioner.I thank them for the declarations they provide to the assembly.Instead of returning to the topics that have already been covered, I would like to dwell on a specific theme: the question of drugs and the way we deal with the spread of drug culture in our societies.I hope in particular that the Portuguese presidency exploits part of the enormous work done by the Finnish presidency and present plans and actions coordinated between the Member States.At international level, there are already struggle programs against drug trafficking, recycling dirty money and so on, but also, from a more properly human point of view, programs to provide assistance to those who try to get rid of drug addiction, with adequate controls and mechanisms for rehabilitation;second, to ensure coordination between the police forces and the judicial systems regarding common penalties and laws;third, to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people;And to end once and for all to the very dangerous terms of ""normalization"" and ""damage reduction"" and demonstrate that any weakening of our determination to prevent the drug from being legalized must be for the good of all."	it
In fact, about four times the fee is charged.The more remote the community, the greater the difference.This is how the problem can be measured.It is not directed against liberalization if it is required to take these factors into account and to enable the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service.In the name of all of our remote and island communities, wherever they may be in the European Union, and not only on behalf of the population in Scotland, I request that you receive the vital line that the postal service represents.President!I consider it a privilege to be able to represent my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, in a qualitatively high -ranking debate about postal services.I want to try to give an answer to the questions raised in the discussion based on the information that Commissioner Bolkestein sent to me.I would like to repeat that Commissioner Bolkestein will be available to the parliamentary committee for regional policy, transport and tourism on Monday.Some MPs, as Mr. Stenmarck, complain that there were delays with the new proposal.Others believe that it is not bad if a little break occurs after the first liberalization step.This is the opinion, for example, Mr. Berthu.The commission's point of view is that the delays in connection with the new proposal are mainly due to the main problems that should not be completely unknown to Parliament.However, we think there is a legal obligation that a proposal will be submitted.It is Commissioner Bolkestein intention to present the Commission such a proposal for acceptance in the first half of this year.January 1, 2003 as a planned date for the implementation of the next steps is still feasible.The proposal will take into account the studies carried out and, in particular, check questions such as universal service that I will come back to.As for the valid guideline and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to implement them.A number of problems are related to the structure of the regulator and its independence.The appointment of the implementation for the Member States is January 2003. Further liberalization will be carried out afterwards.The competition already takes place in some areas, for example in the parcel service and in the press service.The quality of the services has generally improved, especially in cross -border traffic.The quality of the services so important for consumers was the main concern of all speakers, and some of them, like Mr. Rübig, were very clear on this question.The experiences in the countries in which liberalization has already progressed, such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, show that the quality of the service, if the liberalization runs properly, can be increased as a result of the requirements for a higher quality of the service placed by national regulations and the following measures.So there is no sale of the service and its quality.Often liberalizations lead to guaranteed standards, and the continuous standardization of the measurement of the service quality also contributes to this, since these standards better reflect the actual performance.This allows sensible benchmarking and, as a result of the bundled pressure, regulators, competitors and customers an improved customer orientation by the responsible operator.	de
This system seems unsuitable for us.As a compensation for this, however, all possible obstacles must be eliminated before issuing the service certificate and, compared to the commission proposal, tightened conditions for the issuing of the service certificate must be met.The requirements of proper employment, legal stay and insurance cover must not only be given at the time of the exhibition of the ID, but during the entire validity period of the ID and three months later.This should guarantee the reception state that the employee or the self -employed person returns to the sending state after the order made and is covered with insurance law in the event of illness and accident.The entry and residence situation should also be clarified before issuing the service certificate, as part of an objection procedure.We stipulate that the EU service ID must not only be applied for for all Member States, but that it can also be requested for individual Member States.I think this system also better meets the needs of practice.I hope for the proposal to reduce the minimum duration of the previous employment to three months and to orientate the duration of the service ID in the duration of the previous employment in a more flexible manner.However, we remain that the maximum validity period of the service certificate should be 12 months.For the self -employed, in addition to the changes already described, we also propose that the residence criterion must be tightened and that we provide for a way to counter a possible abuse by sham self -employment.I would also like to briefly go into the present amendments that go beyond the amendments of the committee for law and internal market.Of course, I would also like to say that I continue to support the changes submitted by the right committee that were unanimously accepted there.On behalf of my parliamentary group, I have brought four amendments myself, which essentially refer to the correct citation of a council decision.I have to say that I got extremely contradictory statements from the services of the parliament, how this Council decision should be correctly cited;Only with the number, only with the date, with both, how in detail is it cited from the council decision.Two amendments were canceled by the services because the content is allegedly already taken into account in the report.I withdraw the two further applications - that is applications 18 in the report on the self -employed and 21 with those dependent.I can only appeal to the President's conference to reach an agreement as quickly as possible, as can be done correctly in the question of comitology.That would make the life of the rapporteurs in this house much easier in the future.There is also a amendment to both reports from colleague de Palacio.Unfortunately, I have to say that I cannot support this change of change because he changed the result that we have found unanimously in the committee for law and internal market in the substance, and I would like to stay with what we found together as a result after long discussions.I can finally thank all colleagues who have stood by my right report in the right -wing committee.	de
"But since 1997 there has been any result of great relevance.Until now, the Pact for the use of Colonia has not been filled with a lot of substantial content.In addition, in the macroeconomic dialogue the participation of the European Parliament, as a joint interlocutor.Indeed, Luxembourg's guidelines on employment policy have been able to be transferred by member states only insufficiently in some areas, for example, in the field of learning throughout life, as the common report on the employment of 1999 has verified. In particular, in the field of information technology some European states lack qualified labor, as Mr. Sumine has affirmed.Better than its ""imports"" from third states are the relevant investments in professional training and in continued training, in human capital.This is the most effective way to combat unemployment.The most important objective of the summit must be achieved as quickly as possible, the improvement of the competitiveness of the European economy.The Ciampi Group also mentions in this context the Statute of the European Corporation.Calculate that the absence of such a statute means an annual economic loss of 30 billion euros.We do not want the European corporation in its purest form.We need this European society, accompanied by minimum criteria on co -participation for workers.Indeed, our political-social objective is not the market economy in its purest form, but the social market economy as a European model.We should also measure the Lisbon Summit in accordance with its contribution to the achievement of this goal.Mr. President of the Council, do you know how Archimedes exposed his lever theory?He said: ""Give me a support point and I will lift the world.""It is obvious that, in Lisbon, you try to lift the world, or in any case a world that is ours: that of Europe.As for the lever, he described all his mechanisms through his proposal, exciting and exciting in many ways.The support point remains.The support point is resources.Now, you are here in front of an assembly of which several members continue to live with the memory of what I would call the White Book Syndrome, that formidable initiative of Jacques Delors that crashed into the Ecofin accountants.We do not want the same thing to happen today, because the project he proposes is so stimulating that he can boost and give Europe that future that our colleague Goebbels wants.But that implies resources, some resources that I fear, still lacks today.It is therefore responsible for creating them.And, certainly, the 2000 agenda corset will not provide the necessary means.Therefore, you will have to incite your colleagues to finance the proposals that an example will make - and it is one of the important devices that you are proposing - is that of the Information and Knowledge Society."	es
The agreement with Macedonia must be able to be considered as an open door for a membership of the country to the European Union, even if it should not be considered in the very long term.Meanwhile, our policy must tend to ensure that Macedonian legislation is starting to resemble that of the Member States and our policy must reflect this fact even in the names of the Macedonian aid programs.I am thinking here of the flagship program.The name of the Republic, Mr. President, is still a problem due to the Greek susceptibilities.I leave from the principle that the Member States will feel more and more free to use in their own language the name suitable for the Republic.If some countries wish to keep the words ex-Yugoslavia, it is their business, others should not be obliged to it.There is no question of keeping us constantly under pressure.This is why I support Mr. Swoboda's intelligent report;He did not get us used to something else and this also explains my glowing terms about the respectable republic of Macedonia.Mr. President, dear colleagues, allow me above all to say how much I appreciated, personally, the quality of the rapporteur's work, Mr. Swoboda.Today, we decide in favor of the opening of negotiations relating to a stabilization and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia.We do it knowing that this decision, the very first concerning the region, is part of a completely new phase of our relations with the Balkans.It itself constitutes a factor in this new phase, or rather this new policy which determines, with a view to European integration of the region, the only possibility of peaceful settlement of conflicts which agitate the Balkans.Our agreement concerning the negotiation mandate results, as the rapporteur explains in his presentation of reasons, the conviction that must be added to the Union policy, either a regional dimension, or a more specific valuation of the efforts and results of the different countries on the path of the integration of the acquis community.It is this double objective that in my opinion, we must continue: on the one hand, we must support the relative programs, for example, to infrastructure, prepare the stages of the introduction of free trade - even if this is premature - and encourage initiatives of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries of the region;On the other hand, it is necessary to create today with the old Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia a closer integration policy model.That said, we cannot, for various reasons, only send a favorable opinion.As our missions have noted in Skopje, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, sensitive economic progress is recorded in terms of democratic advances and that, more delicate and difficult in this region, of the cohabitation of several ethnicities.In addition, the country has paid the high price of war in neighboring Kosovo, whether in terms of logistical support for NATO forces or export decreases to northern Europe.	fr
"In this context, it must be clearly said which criteria should be used to select these rights.In my opinion, the essential criterion in the rights of citizens against the European institutions.These are the rights of citizens that result from the European project stipulated in the Union contracts.I understand your concern about the rights of the children.In my opinion, part of our work and especially my work as the responsible person for the judiciary and internal affairs are to ensure the rights of the children.We are in an area in which the subsidiarity principle applies fully.The main responsibility for the determination of responsibilities towards the children is the responsibility of the Member States.As for the Union's responsibility as such, I believe that the rights of the children must be recognized in the Charter, whereby the areas must be taken into account in which the Union can provide an additional benefit for improving social, economic and in the broadest sense of the children.I hope we will be able to cope with this challenge in front of which the woman put the commission and the entire convention.Mr President, I had the honor of hearing the commission member talking about this topic several times today, and I can only agree with him.However, I want to ask a slightly different question.We have just heard from Mr. Barnier that he wants to improve communication with the citizens and to focus on the main topics with which the Commission will deal with this year.Would the Commissioner work to ensure that part of the Commission's information budget is provided for the information and hearing of the citizens on the subject of a Charter Charter?It is very important that the citizens feel involved in this process.I know that the convent itself will afford a lot in this area, but the same resources are not available here as with the Commission.Could the Commission imagine using part of its information budget to involve citizens in this debate?The Commission pursues a policy of open and comprehensive discussion about the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non -governmental organizations, but in view of the far -reaching character of this charter with all citizens.I can assure you that the Commission will do everything possible to boost the debate about a future basic right of fundamental rights.The best solution would be a clearly formulated text that is easy to understand by the citizens and at the same time can be used as a legal act.One does not exclude the other.The challenge is to design the final version of the charter in such a way that it meets both requirements.I am very happy that I can count on your support here.Inquiry No. 40 of (H-0095/00): concerns: Article 6 paragraph 1, Article 7 (1) and Article 7 (2) of the contract on the European Union in Article 6 (1) of the contract it says: ""The Union is based on the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as rule of law"".Jörg Haider and the FPÖ, this emerges from some of their statements in recent years, do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, as far as nationals of third countries and Austria live in Austria."	de
It is limited to the exam only of the three topics that affect the structure and working method of only two organs of the European Union - and not even exhausting.Since they are known to everyone, I probably don't have to call them again.On the one hand, this determination is justified, on the one hand, in view of the demands that are repeatedly raised by European citizens and sometimes quite emphatically, as well as on the other hand due to the enormous dimensions of this huge undertaking, which the European Union has now undertaken with the expansion.In this respect, it cannot be concerned that questions that solution would ensure the smooth functioning of all and not only certain organs of the European Union would be excluded from the agenda of the government conference.Consideration must also be taken into account the topics that concern the citizens of Europe every day and with which they have to deal with.The European Parliament has clearly spoken out in many debates and in the reports submitted so far for the convening of the government conference.At the same time, however, I demand that there are also questions that the reform - I repeat it - improve and perfect it, as well as subject areas that directly affect and interest European citizens.This includes, for example, health, energy, culture, transport and tourism.On the one hand, it is not yet clear whether an expansion of the agenda will be enforced or not.At this point, let me really praise the political behavior of the Portuguese presidency, because it has repeatedly committed to the European Parliament to make the effort offered in this regard.On the other hand, the question of whether other points will be recorded may not reduce the meaning that every single member country of the government conference has to put on.The institutional framework for future Europe is a basic principle of European integration and therefore a question of the highest national importance for every Member State of the Union.Therefore, I request this high house, which Mr. Leinen and I have submitted to you so that the government conference can be opened on February 14 and our two representatives at this conference, Mr. Brok and Mr. Tsatos, can go to the difficult work that you can expect there.The same applies to the European Commission, although I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his cooperation with the European Parliament and his extremely constructive suggestions.President!The faction of the European People's Party was not satisfied with the result of Helsinki's European Council.The agenda seemed too tight to us because our faction put itself in the logic of the contract and specifically in the protocol about the institutions of the Union.In Helsinki, the governments confirmed that a mini reform was sufficient as long as the European Union consisted of fewer than 21 states, while more members are required for a profound reform.The same European Council of Helsinki approved an expansion by 13 new Member States.Thus there is an incoherency between the opening of the accession negotiations with 13 countries and the desire for a mini reform.However, we continue to follow the logic of the contract and want the agenda of the next government conference to enable a deeper reform of the Union.	de
Is the application of a tax taxation base based on alcohol equivalent?The question of excise duties, which refers to the honorable parliamentary, is the responsibility of the Member States in question.The Commission does not have any tool to impose a reduction or increase in excise duties on alcoholic beverages or other products.Towards the end of the year, the Commission will present a report on the differentials of excise duties between the Member States.It is out of doubt that such a relationship will arouse a discussion both with Parliament and with the Council, given the substantial differences in the level of the rates of excise duties between the Member States.For example, it seems to me that the honorable parliamentary referred to this aspect, in France there are no excise duties on wine, while in the United Kingdom yes: this determines a distortion of the single market because the wine is marked by France in the United Kingdom.The question specifically focused on the relationship between excise duties and alcohol tenor in the assets subject to excise duty.The Commission does not have tools to intervene.In the case of Sweden, in fact, excise duties are used to reduce alcohol consumption.Although this measure entails a disparity of excise duties between Sweden and the other Member States of the Union, - and this in turn increases the transfrontier contraband of alcohol - it is a legitimate tool to reduce the consumption of alcohol.Obviously there is also the elasticity of the demand, in our case the elasticity of the price of the demand.I'm not sure what the value is, but it is not the same as zero and therefore produces an effect.My question would have been practically identical to that of Mr Purvis, but I allow myself to insist.Given that, as you say, excise duties are a prerogative of the Member States, the use of this prerogative in a way that produces an unjust discrimination of manufacturers in a region of the community compared to others, it could still be in conflict with the principle of the single market.Returning to the example of the honorable Purvis, and I think in particular of the production of whiskey of malt in the highlands, - an ultra -aperitical region of Europe, deeply depressed, with an entire agricultural community that depends on this production as well as the distillery sector - the widespread practice of imposing higher excise excuses on the alcohol contained in the Scottish whiskey, in the Dutch GinDanese compared to alcohol in beer or wine seems to me a discrimination and a discriminatory use of a faculty that is declaredly prerogative of the Member States.I can confirm to the honorable Maccormick and the other honorable parliamentarians that the current situation, namely the existence of diversified excise duties between the Member States, in fact does not favor the proper functioning of the single market.We must not only limit ourselves to alcoholic beverages.In the case of gasoline, for example, excise duties in Germany are different from those in the Netherlands and consequently Dutch motorists cross borders to go to the full in Germany.It is obviously a distortion of the internal market.	it
The civil war is over in Cambodia and has relaxed the political situation, but the way the political opposition is now treated fulfills us with great concern.If it goes on like this, this must also have consequences for the relationships between the Union to Cambodia.President!In international law, a new doctrine currently prevails that no state may treat its citizens and the people living in his field as he wants, and state sovereignty is not an obstacle to an intervention from outside due to gross human rights violations, even if the government itself has been chosen legally or even democratically.Objection examples of this are the case of Pinochet-Ugarte, the Kosovo conflict and in a weakened form the debate on government formation in Austria in the Union's own ranks.The same danger now exists in Cambodia if it is not possible to legally responsible for the former leadership of the regime.At the same time, the fight against impunity, the impunity of those responsible, is endangered.This situation should also realize us that the ratification of the contract to establish an international criminal court is slow.President!We had an extremely useful debate about human rights yesterday.I am pleased that there was now an opportunity to illuminate a number of areas in the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - in which the protection of human rights is a particularly great challenge.First to Kosovo.The Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in the defense designs with regard to general politics towards Kosovo, with regard to the ongoing ethnic acts of violence and with regard to the prisoners in Serbian prison.Our efforts in Kosovo and the other region are aimed at short and medium-term recovery of the situation and long-term stabilization.In particular, we support the development of a free, democratic and multi -ethnic society.Our aid programs in the fields of democratization and human rights should be continued in order to create trust in general and in particular in order to create trust between the different communities as possible.We have always condemned ethnic violence, regardless of which ethnic group is perpetrator or victim.We consider them just as unacceptable to the minorities of the Serbs and Roma, as we have thought in the past to be unacceptable to the Kosovo Albanians.We support the efforts of the Unmik, the KFOR and OSCE to build up a functional civil administration and to ensure law and order.In this context, we are emphatically advocating the latest appeal from the high representative to the Member States to provide more police officers for the UN Civil Police Mission in Kosovo.This point was addressed in the pronunciation of several speakers.Hopefully this makes it clear that we have to devote ourselves to both the non-military and military aspects of this policy in developing a common foreign and security policy.We have to have clear objectives for our control activity and the establishment of institutions, but it is just as important that we have clear objectives for a military capacity.We are still very concerned about the fact that so many civilians are currently being recorded in the expectation of their procedure or after their conviction in Serbian prisons.	de
My answer is perhaps little satisfactory right now, but I would like to assure your honor that the Commission will make that decision in a matter of weeks.I ask for your understanding for this small delay in the decision of the Commission.Mr. Commissioner, do you have any reason, for public health reasons, to make a difference in the tax rates that are applied, for example, on the Scottish whiskey or the French Burgundy Wine or even on the Bavarian beer of my colleague?Is it possible to provide for the application of an equivalent base for alcoholic beverages in the European tax system?The question of tax on specific consumption taxes, referred to in the honor, is a prerogative of the Member State in question.The Commission does not have instruments to apply an increase or reduction of special taxes on alcoholic products or on any other product.By the end of this year, the Commission will submit a report on the differences that exist between the Member States in the field of specific consumption taxes.The report will undoubtedly trigger a debate with Parliament and with the Council on the current situation, which reflects the existence of great differences between member states in regard to special tax rates.For example, in France - and I think it is what your honor referred to - the wine is exempt from special taxes, while in the United Kingdom it is not.This produces a distortion of the internal market, which results in the smuggling of French wine in the United Kingdom.The issue is relative specifically to the relationship between special taxes and the degree of alcohol of products subject to specific consumption taxes.The commission has no means at its disposal to intervene in this area.In the case of Sweden, the instrument of specific consumption taxes is used to stop alcohol consumption.Although this practice results in inequalities in special taxes between Sweden and other member states of the Union -which only increases cross -border smuggling of alcoholic products -is a legitimate instrument to reduce alcohol consumption.There is naturally elasticity of demand, in this case, an elasticity of the price of demand.I am not very sure of what is exactly, but it is not zero, therefore, it has to have repercussions.My question would have been almost identical to what Mr. Purvis has asked, but I would like to insist a little more on the subject.Okay, as you say, specific consumption taxes are part of the prerogatives of Member States.However, the use of that prerogative so that it unfairly discriminates against the producers of a part of the community with respect to those of others could violate the principle of the single market.For example, if we take the case where Mr. Purvis and I were thinking, that of the highlands where the malt whiskey is produced -a very peripheral area of ​​Europe that is in a difficult situation, in which an entire agricultural community, in addition to the distiller community dependsOr the Danish Aquavit with a type higher than the alcohol of beer or wine alcohol, it seems to me that it is discrimination and that makes discriminatory use of something that, I recognize, is part of the prerogatives of the Member States.	es
Next week I go to Bundestag, in Berlin.I have already gone to the French Senate.Thus, throughout all that debate, whenever I can, I will go directly to see the national deputies.It is not, regarding dialogue with citizens, to propaganda or advertising or communication even.I would like it to be a real dialogue and that, after the exhibition of a small filming in which the imperatives of the institutional reform are objectively explained, those present in the stands can intervene and respond with the open microphone.We are going to carry out -repito- that dialogue initiative in sporadic or structured cooperation with the Member States and ardently desire that the governments of the fifteen, with the support of their lordships, participate, according to the modalities they consider more appropriate and adequate, in that dialogue initiative.Mr. President, I would like to add to the Circle of Studies of Mr. Barnier composed of the 700 fellows to have those who debate.It is not very fun to have to discuss the government conference and transparency with oneself.Regarding the government conference, Mr. Barnier said during his presentation in the Parliament that social policy was not subject to decisions by majority, however, when taking a look at page 63, I see that the fight against discrimination, the right of free circulation and establishment -that is, the directives on stay -, all social security, the renewal of regulations no.1408, of measures in the field of social policy - with few exceptions - they will submit to qualified majority.Doesn't Mr. Barnier produce repair to touch with it the spine of the electoral processes of the member countries?It is these issues that make the population go to the polls and those that lead to a new majority in the Danish Parliament and other parliaments.Can they be regulated from Brussels?Is this starts from the decentralization process of the one that Mr. Prodi spoke this morning?I experienced great satisfaction when last week I learned that the Commission will pay special attention to the concept of subsidiarity, and its reference, not only to relations between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Union, the Member States, the Regions and the Cities.I hope that in the search for dialogue by the regions of Europe, Commissioner Barnier deepens that thought and learns from what he hears.Mr. Commissioner, I mean one of your answers to the previous questions in which you have mentioned what I call the closing possibilities of the treaty to the risks of deviation and, in particular, the diversification of the sanctions that can fall on a Member State, in accordance with article 7, for violation of fundamental freedoms.Do you think that these proposals or proposals of that nature can be part of the CIG's mandate, as formulated in Helsinki?For my part, it does not seem to me.Don't you fear that such sanctions are diverted and do not serve to punish human rights violations, but simple divergences, opinion crimes or divergences regarding the dominant European thought?	es
Finally, they resumed, in current terms, the proposals of the White Paper of President Delors for the promotion of a European project aimed at achieving a unified network of infrastructure and services.These indications, largely coinciding with the orientations of the programmatic document of the Portuguese presidency that, therefore, will be debated at the Lisbon Summit, have been rejected and misrepresented in the Commission of Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament, for a majorNot only in a market assembly.This Parliament, Mr. President, who has managed to express on numerous occasions a strong European vocation, must demonstrate in this circumstance that he can express a majority favorable to a political union of Europe, capable of dealing with the weaknesses and failures of the markets.Mr. President, Mr. Katiforis's report is interesting.In its original version it shows the way to a renewed economic policy, which points to more than cuts and balance.The EU is in a situation that implies that we can achieve great growth and fight, seriously, against unemployment, without risking objectives such as price stability and budgetary balance.That is why it is unfortunate that the PPE-of and the Eldr voted in the commission against the proposal that dealt with the fight, in a serious way, against unemployment.The debate and vote here in the plenary must correct this.However, it is satisfactory that unity has been achieved in relation to some strategic proposals, that is, the economic policy of the Union must give preference to investments, among other things, to integrate all citizens of the Union into the information society, which can have great economic importance as well.I also think that it is necessary to strengthen the trans -European network connections to reach even candidate countries, both in terms of physical transport and computer infrastructure.This is important for growth, but also to avoid differences between people, both within the EU and against candidate countries.Candidate countries should not be left behind;A part of the project must be that the EU becomes a world pioneer in the field of communications.For this, society is required to assume responsibilities for the construction, fast and energetic, of modern computer infrastructure, that reach small businesses, poor regions and common citizens.Now we have that opportunity, let's take advantage of it!Mr. President, the advantage that entails intervening at the end of a debate is that it can be objected to what has been said previously.I would like to say that I am in total disagree with Mrs. Villiers that this is such an interesting debate.I believe that the European Parliament does not provide at all a great service to think only of outdated concepts and manifest policies and outdated ideas.	es
It is the only time I have talked about it.But today I have to do it and I do it from the heart.I was born in Germany, Mrs. President, I was educated in Sweden and married a Spaniard.I know what democracy is because I have had the advantage of growing in a country like Sweden, which had a long democratic tradition.I arrived in the Basque Country with all my good will to integrate and, despite what has happened to me, I remain convinced that one day the Basque Country will have the desired peace, because those who think that there is conflict in the Basque Country tell you that the only conflict that the Basque Country has is called ETA, and it has to disappear.We'll talk about the rest.(Strong and prolonged applause) The rest will be resolved by the Democrats exposing all ideas, because there is freedom of expression in the Basque Country, there is freedom of vote, there is freedom.The only thing that Caarta this freedom is ETA.That ETA disappears and that the Democrats speak.(Great applause) I thank you, Mrs. Dührkop Dührkop, and I express all my sympathy and all my respect approval of the act of the previous session the act of the previous session has been distributed.Is there any observation?We are about to examine the issue of commission reform and, as you will remember, Mrs. President, at the beginning of the last partial period of sessions I raised the question of whether, in favor of transparency, it could be made that the registration of interests of the deputies were more available for the public publishing it in the Internet network.You promised to the Parliament that would raise that issue to the quasters that same night.I would like to know if you are now in a position to confirm the Parliament if you have agreed in principle that the registration must be published in the Internet network and, if so, if you will, personally, personally, a term - at the same time on April 1 - to do so.Honor, the table has expressed its principle agreement to include on the Internet the registration in which deputies must declare their financial interests, but the questionors still reflect on the problems of a legal nature that this implies.Very soon we will have a decision.(The act is approved) Reform of the Commission in accordance with the agenda, the commission of the Commission on the reform of the European Commission is communicated.I immediately grant the word to Mr. President Romano Prodi..- (IT) Mrs. President, ladies and lords deputies, in last July, here before you, I solemnly assumed the commitment to reform the commission.I want to briefly remember what happened in last July: after the crisis of the previous commission occurred, I had just appointed and you first ratified that designation.That episode had as its culminating moment the commitment I assumed to reform the Commission: a strong reform that must produce a true revolution in the way of working of the commission.	es
In that sense, we believe that we totally respect what we conclude.I simply ask the commission, before executing the second section, to come to inform the Budget Commission.I totally agree and we will do so.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00.Ancient in accordance with the agenda, we proceed to the discussion of the report (A5-0011/2000) of Mr. Langen on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, of the decision of the European Parliament and the Council (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370 (COD)) by which a multiannual program for the promotion of renewable energy in the community is approved in the community - andI thank Mr. Langen - although he is not present - for the work he has done so that this program is approved both in Parliament and in the Council.This project has been long and complicated.In the future, the research aimed at determining the use of renewable energy sources must also be stimulated.Although this new directive has many virtues, it also has many defects.For example, the absence in the same of Pantano's mob.The mob should not be classified in the same group as fossil fuels.If peat cannot be included directly among renewable energies, among non -fossil energy sources, then it should be considered as a specific group, especially when applying an ecological tax.It is not fair that the mob is evaluated with the same indicators that, for example, the coal.The development of renewable energy sources is part of the set of solutions to end the dependence of import energy by the Union.The research also plays a fundamental role in the framework of the next round of negotiations for the expansion of the EU.The dependence on import energy more seriously affects some countries in Eastern Europe, whose economic infrastructure is still subject to the dependence of the Russian energy that was created in the times of the Soviet Union.The EU adheres to the Kyoto protocol on climate change.We are all concerned about the environment and the future of our children.The proportion of renewable energy sources must be increased in the bulk of energy production, but this must also be done in a rational way.We must remember that it must spend a long time before we are in a position to build our basic energy production on the sole base of renewable energy sources.And for this we will need energy without impact on climate, nuclear energy.Mr. President, on behalf of the PSE group, I congratulate me that we have obtained a result in the conciliation procedure related to the Auto II program.First, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Langen, for the excellent work he has done with respect to this report.I also want to thank the Head of the Delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr. Causan, because as Mr. Langen has already pointed out, the fight in the Conciliation Committee has been hard.However, today we can see that the result of the conciliation clearly carries the seal of the European Parliament.	es
Perhaps before addressing our criticisms to subjects outside Parliament, we should take a serious examination of conscience, to really understand what we are doing.Mr. President, I will not take the time of speech at my disposal to treat the individual cases we deal with today.I agree with the honorable Plooij-Van Gorsel on the fact that we cannot discuss it in detail.Perhaps next time we will have to talk about Corus, the merger made between Nederlands Hoogevenens and British Steel.I would like to frame the discussion in a slightly wider context, analyzing the relationship between community policy in the field of company mergers and politics in other sectors.In this regard, I am pleased that Commissioner Liikanen is present and that we can conduct this debate, which concerns the interests of the workers, not only with Mrs. Commissioner Diamantopoulou, but also with competent commissioners for the other sectors.Unlike the speaker who preceded me, who starts from the assumption that there must be no rules, launch an appeal in favor of a greater consistency of the commission policy in the sector in question taking into account the different perspectives.We must develop a perspective that takes into consideration the corporate reality.At this moment we are witnessing the birth of numerous large mergers between companies from the Anglo -Saxon tradition and companies related to the Renan tradition.In this context, what remains of the concept of what must be a company is of enormous importance, that is, if it represents only a property in the hands of shareholders or constitutes a wider Stakeholder Society, aimed at ensuring a certain continuity for workers, consumers, suppliers and local population, and to fulfill a social function.I therefore ask that the general directions of the Commission and the various commissioners develop a wider vision of the corporate governments.I think this would be extremely appropriate in consideration of the programs presented in recent days regarding the good government in Europe, which also includes corporate policy.Also in Italy the government meets the delegation of the unions and delegates of the Goodyear to try to find a solution to the closing policy unilaterally decided by the North American multinational in an area of ​​Central Italy, Cisterna di Latina, already affected by other renovations.The closure means the loss of more than a thousand jobs, between direct and indirect, hundreds of families entrusted to insecurity and new poverty.Goodyear workers are conducting an exemplary struggle, with the awareness of not carrying out the defense of their only interests but also of those of Goodyear workers in the various European countries, and there are many: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia.Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the grandstand, anxious to understand what their future will be and what solidarity the European Union will offer, what policy will make to prevent multinationals from acting only and exclusively in their market and profit interest.Goodyear, like other multinationals, has had more than 166 billion.The European Union, in all its instances, must exercise all its power so that these and other disputes are resolved.	it
The time for questions to the Commission is closed.(The session, suspended at 7:30 p.m., is resumed at 9 p.m.) Community policy in the water field (continued) The agenda calls for the rest of the debate on the recommendation for the second reading relating to community policy in the field of water.Mr. President, the situation of soft waters in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and quality, to decrease.To this must be added the problems of water pollution that strike the possible new member states of the East.Didn't a tank containing cyanide have just broken in Romania, threatening the aquifers who supply the population of Yugoslavia?I understood that Ms. Wallström, that I thank very much for her presence this evening, will go to the region.I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can deny the need for this directive to put an end to the fragmentation currently characterizing water policy and facilitate the start of a program of measures specific to each hydrographic basin.Gestation was difficult and complex, the interests at stake are multiple and the opinions, shared.I have no doubt that the rapporteur in this legislature, Ms. Lienemann, has made a big effort and a lot of time to reconcile and reconcile the positions and she has largely succeeded.Nevertheless, knowing and correctly assessing all situations and perspectives is an almost impossible task.I come from a country, half of which looks at the Mediterranean and where the availability of water historically responds to the whims of a changing climate and a difficult configuration of the terrain.The Mediterranean region had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity century after century, year after year and day after day until today.This is why the practical application made by the directive of the obligation, taken up in article 164 of the treaty, according to which community legislation must take into account the diversity of its regions, seems essential to us.Precisely in application of this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People's Party will oppose amendments 4 (considering 21), 13 and 49 (article 11, letter D) because they imply a serious limitation in a field of exclusive management of Member States such as the regulation of their water resources.The community could very difficult to determine the conditions of its regulations in the different regions, given the different internal balances which are always at stake and which in any case require an in -depth knowledge of the different areas and interests concerned.Similarly, we reject the amendments which aim to include the total cost of water for 2010. We must undoubtedly set water prices which encourage its effective use but which, at the same time, allow to maintain the competitiveness of the production sectors in the most disadvantaged regions and which do not prevent their legitimate development.	fr
Will it include it in the work of your audit committee?Finally, the socialist group agrees with the budgeting based on activities and responsibility and, as Mr. Prodi says, you will be judged for your actions and not for your words.This point is closed.I thank Mr. President Prodi, as well as Mr. Commissioner Kinnock.Declaration of the high representative of common foreign policy and security in accordance with the agenda, the declaration of the high representative of common foreign policy and security is proceeded. I have the pleasure of giving a hot welcome to Mr. Javier Solana, to whom I immediately grant the word.- Mrs. President, as her honor can imagine is for me a great pleasure to be again with her lordships here in the European Parliament.Since the last time, ladies, gentlemen deputies, who appeared before their lordships to tell them about the issues related to foreign policy and security in our continent, many things have happened.Sometimes we would think that too many have passed.I would like this afternoon to share with you some ideas, fundamentally about common foreign policy and security. It is true, as I said, that the world has moved a lot in recent months and a good number of events have taken place, but I will leave for the time of questions and answers to specify, if your lordships have it well, some of the questions that you want to ask me.Throughout these months, since the last time I appeared before their lordships, important events have taken place here, also in the European Union.Let me remember two.One very dear to all, members of Parliament, and especially for the Presidency: the inauguration of the Intergovernmental Conference and the opening of negotiations with future members of the European Union.Without a doubt, Kosovo's events and in general in the Balkans have mobilized all our hearts and our intelligence;Important matters in the Middle East, where the president of Parliament has played an important role in her last trip;Some important events to unlock the summit between Europe and Africa, in which I had the satisfaction of participating in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency;The great meeting that took place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen Latin American countries to also try to build a deeper relationship between the European Union and the Latin American countries.Without a doubt, Chehenia has also been at the bottom of our hearts and I will have the opportunity to say some words at the end of my intervention, after an important conversation that I have had this morning with the representative of the Council of Europe, Mr. Álvaro Gil-Robles, about the visit he has just made to the region.But I understand that their lordships have asked me for this appearance to speak to them more directly about foreign policy and especially about the security policy in Europe after Helsinki.I am going to refer briefly;If your lordships are good, asking questions in the question session, I will gladly answer them.Let me remember that in Helsinki, the summit under the Finnish presidency took place not a century ago, but scarcely two months ago.In Helsinki, fundamental decisions were made for foreign and security policy in our continent.	es
"While restructuring to improve competitiveness and conquering market shares from an economic aspects are commendable, such a measure can be reduced if, at the request of the financiers, who are often the only shallow holder, they are the only purpose of increasing the asset of these companies in order to be able to achieve greater profits.The different announcements of my colleagues in recent times, be it on the part of Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this regard.In my opinion, rationalization of management and better results must primarily serve the company and therefore its employees, although there may also be financial effects.Today, a process of corporate mergers and mergers as well as relocation of production with their known effects on product quality as well as with the human level, especially for the family as a core cell of society, dramatic social effects, in particular unemployment, difficult working conditions and greater flexibility.So there is a great risk of a division of our planet: On the one hand, the poor countries that provide workers and on the other the rich countries that procure capital.Doesn't Europe have to offer protection to maintain a certain balance between higher profitability and social well -being?We should not forget that the human capital presents the basis for the operation of a company that ensures good results.Finally, I would like to point out that the third letter means ""difference"" in the name of the group that I belong.Europe has the task of raising its voice as an alternative to the exclusively profit -oriented restructuring, which are not subject to rules, which points in this uniform current of restructuring in a different direction.President!In one of my neighboring regions, the Michelin Group announced extensive layoffs in their work in Stoke-on-Trent last month due to the restructuring of the company and increasing global competitive pressure on the world market for mature.Like all of the MPs present, this loss at workplaces is saddened by me.I also saddle the announcement by Goodyear, which gave the occasion for this resolution.However, I very much doubt whether a European works council would have been able to change the decision of this company.This high house is really very good in writing resolutions and laws, and sometimes we forget in this institution that Europe alone cannot survive.We need multinational companies that have their business basis on our continent.After the few months I am here, I find it astonishing that we all talk about the need to promote corporate growth in the EU, but with almost all of our resolutions, the companies actually cause the companies to leave.At our last plenary conference in Brussels, we voted on the Altakuto Directive and brought about a retrospective law that has huge additional costs for the European motor vehicle manufacturers that they could not foreseen.Two days later, Toyota said that with several thousand employees in my region, this guideline would not only increase the costs of cars, but could also mean layoffs for his work in derbyshire.In a world in which there is certainly less regulation, we apparently believe in this house that we can expect more regulation and more costs to the companies and that, without the temptation of other locations, they will remain in the European Union."	de
We cannot therefore completely tell each other dissatisfied with what was obtained.Of course it is always better to be able to have more resources - I will continue to insist on this point - and in faster times.I consider, however, that this program offers good prospects to many others.I would like to emphasize that culture is not financed exclusively starting from this fund.Culture is not only part of the chapter that bears this name, but falls into numerous other areas.Huge resources in favor of culture are also available within the structural funds, an aspect that we must take into consideration and highlight.Fortunately for me, I am part of the Commission for regional policy, transport and tourism and therefore I was able to use me so that this aspect receives the attention it deserves.I also believe that it was decided to support the position according to which the expected budget is sufficient.If, in fact, the proposed changes will not go through, citizens will pay the consequences.I have always supported the speaker from this point of view.I consider, however, that it is necessary, as the speaker reiterates, to reach a modification of the codecision within the cig.In this case it will no longer be essential to resort to unanimity.We evaluate the numerous improvements that have been made extremely positively.We no longer speak of megaprogetti, space is left to cultural networks, and the attention shifts to the promotion of reading and translations, very important themes for the smallest linguistic areas.I would like to congratulate the speaker and the honorable Reding for this text on Culture 2000. Now I can only say: let's put ourselves at work.Lady president, the honorable colleagues who preceded me have already treated all my points and I believe that the consent between the parliamentary groups as well as among the members of the Commission for Culture.I must say that, reluctantly, I will also vote in favor of the project of common decision of the Council and Parliament.I relieve reluctantly because of the unacceptable attitude of the Council and not because our delegation, the rapporteur and President Gargani have not done an excellent job - quite the opposite - or because he has objections regarding the position taken by Mrs. Commissioner Reding, who has adopted a very positive attitude given the margins at his disposal.Shame!An allocation of 167 million euros for many years is a shame for the European Union!We are literally forced to humiliate theatrical groups, young musicians, pioneers of the arts and letters, giving the content to one and rejecting another thirty, and we offer the image of a foreign, hostile, enemy and contrary Europe to any attempt to cultural activities, while instead the union should not be fugitive.Such a conclusion is really painful, given that our future is not only made of euros, of extensions or geostrative conveniences, but we must also guarantee cultural growth for European unification.There will be no progress until we maintain the principle of unanimity, according to which the Netherlands have imposed their ultimatum of 167 million euros yesterday and tomorrow the Haider government will tell us that cultural activities must be supported.	it
We have developed parks everywhere, which constitute a key element of the Life program.The fact remains that these parks, made with few financial means, without signaling, have no effect and are useless.This is why I invite Parliament and the Commission to give this question all the attention it deserves.Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, since the beginning of 1999, discussions have taken place between the institutions regarding the proposed regulations concerning a third stage for the instrument for the environment - Life.I would like to congratulate the Environment Commission and Ms. Lienemann for the excellent and constructive collaboration that we had in this area.Thanks to this, I can confirm that the Commission can accept in full or in their nine principle of the fourteen amendments that have been adopted by the Environment Commission.The Commission approves above all the amendments 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 13, relating to the comitology procedures.Parliament has, in this case, fully taken into account the objections of the Commission against the common position.The Commission may also approve in principle amendment 4, which must however be introduced in another way into the text.With regard to amendments 5 and 6, I would like to emphasize that the project for a sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water, as well as the project to limit air pollutants which contribute to the greenhouse effect are largely taken up by Life.However, the Commission considers that mentioning this apart goes against the initial decision to center the proposal on some priority points.There is also a risk of overlap with other community programs such as the fifth framework program for research, technological development and demonstration actions.The key measures of this program - the quality of the water, the city of tomorrow and the innovative products and processes - partly use the same subjects.As for the budget, I am delighted with the confidence shown by the Environment Commission.Amendment 12 offers a larger budget than that set in the common position.I am also convinced that Life has enormous potential.This instrument could finance good projects with credits higher than those mentioned in the budget proposal.The amount fixed in amendment 12, however, does not comply with the budgetary plan established on the basis of the 2000 agenda. Allow me to add that if we increase the budget it is obvious that we will also require the environment directorate that it deals with a growing number of projects.It is also necessary to take into account other programs, for which decisions must be made within the framework of the CODECISION procedure.The Commission sticks, in this stage, to the amount fixed in the common position.With regard to amendment 3, which we did not adopt during the first reading, I would like to emphasize that each program has its own objectives, eligible costs and requests.	fr
This applies to the minimum rights stipulated in the contract, to ensure the free movement of the workforce - while maintaining social rights - this also applies to economic coordination and economic cooperation.So we need coordination and cooperation, but convergence for the objectives not to strive for the funds.I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Jan Andersson, for his very constructive efforts to compensate for different opinions and support his report.I myself can support the report, but I am critical of individual points.I support z.For example, it is not the requirement that the Commission should do something against the so-called unfair competition between social and tax systems if such an intervention is to be used to brake innovative thinking, development and effective design of our social systems or to prevent the reduction of too high tax burdens in many EU countries.I reject detailed provisions of the Commission on the scope and quality of child or elderly care and are skeptical about the determination of a value for a common poverty limit.The coordination of social policy and dialogue is good.However, we should not all treat them according to the same pattern, but there must be space for a variety of solutions.President, Ms. Commissioner!I would like to make some positive comments on the modernization of social protection presented here, but also indicate problem areas.I find it welcomed that it is slowly but surely moving to this dossier.I think that is right and useful.I am also positively set to the guidelines of the message, the strategy.Hopefully the four goals shown in it can then be achieved properly.In addition, we would like to underline how important the way we tackle the problem is on the one hand the trial à la Luxemburg.However, we also need, for example, and Ms. Van Lancker has already pointed out that, guidelines for atypical work, for self -employed without employees, etc. However, two problems for which we have to find solutions are likely to arise.First, there is a lowering of the social protection level, where we hope for convergence at a level.Let me give me some examples from an investigation that the Dutch unions recently carried out on the effects of reforms in the European Union on social protection.According to this study, alignment occurs everywhere.Numerous, even most of the equations, are obviously directed downwards, the rest are improvements.Most adjustments relate to pensions, eleven restrictions and two improvements.In unemployment benefit, we find six deterioration and five improvements.The equations are, for example, to the promotion of employment, reduction in social expenditure, but also to the competition and the WWU criteria.This political competition can be found primarily in the northern countries.We observe the safest social protection and even improvements in the southern countries.Summa Summarum is also likely to decrease the influence of the social partners in this entire process.This is not true, and therefore the convergence strategy should be based on the best approaches.Cappuccino, to put it this way, don't always meet us for the benefit.President!Now I would like to congratulate the commission and the rapporteur.The commission because it took a further step towards the approach of social protection, the rapporteur because he provided an excellent report.	de
Social integration, which requires a firm commitment in economic, political and social terms on the part of the responsible authorities, is the only way to prevent these events from happening again where there are already important communities of immigrant workers.We are all immigrants.For generations, the human being has not always stayed inside the borders of a nation state.There have constantly had migratory flows.Geographic mobility is not an invention of the 20th century, nor their economic and work reasons.We are all immigrants, whether personally or by a member of our family or one of our ancestors.However, instead of being at the origin of events that we condemn here, these migratory flows must be generating social, cultural and economic enrichment.We believe that what has happened to El Ejido, which is unfortunately not the exclusivity of this locality of the European Union, requires, first of all, the clear and clear conviction of the brutal racist and xenophobic explosion of certain residents of El Ejido against the immigrant workers in the region, empowering, criminalizing and aggressing a whole community for an isolated fact.Second, this requires immediate action of all administrations;Coordination between them is essential in order to fight this type of xenophobic and racist acts.More concretely, the local authorities, the mayors, have a direct responsibility in the prevention of any racist or xenophobic demonstration, all the more so when it implies violent events against people and their property.These authorities also have the obligation to promote difficult agreements between the parties present and not to prevent them, as is the case of the mayor of El Ejido.Thirdly, this requires that political parties assume a direct responsibility in the political exercise of their public functions and prevent any act or declaration of an individual nature contrary to the principles and values ​​of cohabitation and tolerance expressed by the European Union.Finally, this requires from the European Union a responsibility for monitoring the application of its principles, preserving its territory from any racist or xenophobic manifestation, its support and collaboration with the rest of the national, regional and local administrations as well as with associations and non -governmental organizations in the application of these principles as well as in the context of a continuous action to combat racism and xenophobia and in favorof the integration of all immigrants residing in the territory of the European Union.Mr. President, at first, our group did not see the need to present this proposal because it seemed to act of a local phenomenon.However, the events of El Ejido constitute a symptom of a phenomenon which crosses all of Europe and which deserves the greatest attention.We thought we were getting rid of the horror of intolerance that racism had unleashed in Europe, but as the years spend why not say so social degradation in our Europe is combined with the increase in migratory flows from the countries around us and a greater awareness of human rights, and this climate of racism and intolerance increases.This is why what seemed to be a local phenomenon - to El Ejido- becomes a worrying symptom which coincides with the rise of parties like that of Haider.This is the reason why we propose, from the European Parliament, the adoption of urgent measures which attack all the factors involved and which are of immediate application: respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism, the increase in budgets and action lines in social and health matters.	fr
"The question, is, honor, an issue that we must all consider and I have recently done it diplomatly, it refers to the consistency of resolution 12/99 of the Security Council.I know it is an extraordinarily delicate issue, but we must all ask about the logic underlying that resolution and the possibility of its application.We are supporters of its full and total application: now, we have to examine that resolution -and probably that is something that the United Nations Security Council will have to do, sooner or later -in the sense that, as happened in the past in other frames and other world strategic scenarios, it can be examined whether or not to maintain in the future certain type of procedures and certain type of logic and equilibriathe balances to which the approval of the resolution was due.What we must do, what we are doing by the European Union, is to guarantee to Mr. Kouchner all the media and their honor is right, we are obliged, before our citizens, to explain them periodic and clearly to what extent those means are used well or not.On the part of the Council, we propose to facilitate during the Portuguese Presidency information about it.Mr. President in the exercise of the Council, I totally agree with you.The problem is not Mr. Kouchner, it is the legal basis on which he works, that is, Resolution 1244. That said, I believe that the responsibility of the Union, that is, yours, but also ours, is to start working to overcome this provisional nature of resolution 1244 and imagine a future scenario for the entire region.I think it is the lack of definition of this scenario that causes or favors the excesses, accidents, the murders that Mr. Alavanos has spoken.Does the advice think of the question of Kosovo's definitive statute?And if so, do you plan to do it in a general redefinition of the region, avoiding the maximum multiply the microstates, as some have a tendency to do, and reunifying the parties, in this case, Kosovo and Albania?Since its author is not present, question No. 7 decays.Question No. 8 Formulated by (H-0796/99): Subject: New Interreg initiative in point 1 of Annex 2 of its Interreg Communication Project entitled ""Promotion of urban, rural and coastal development"", the Commission authorizes the renewal and development of historical urban centers through a joint cross-border strategy of which, however, it is expressly excluded to housing.Given the high number of houses of historical interest that exists in rural areas, including small country houses, and considering the need, for several reasons, to maintain the population of rural areas and attract new inhabitants to them, don't you think the council that these objectives could be achieved if projects will be financed in favor of housing in areas covered by Interreg?Mr. President, the Council - and we could even say the Portuguese presidency in particular - is extremely aware of the importance of the problems addressed by the honor in his question and I mean that we always dedicate all the attention to the community policies of development of rural areas."	es
"It has been demonstrated, as we have denounced since 1995, that this transfer has been an absurdity.It seems right to us that Portugal and France want to reach an agreement, but those anchovies must be caught in Portuguese waters and not in the Gulf of Biscaglia.Today scientific studies show that the population of anchovy in the Gulf of Biscaglia is in danger of extinction.And now the restriction measures of the amount of anchovies that can be fished in the Gulf of Biscaglia arrive.I don't know if you have realized the responsibility that, as Council of Ministers, you have had in these years, and that you will have in 2000, against the thousands of families who live in the fishing of the exciusa in the north of the Iberian peninsula.I would like to point out, honorable deputy, that with the sentence of 5 October 1999 the Court of Justice of the European Communities decided that this transfer, which had been approved, complosed the principles established in the Council Regulations no.3760/92, and in particular in paragraph 1 of article 9, which provides that the Member States can exchange the totality or part of the availability of fishing that have been attributed to them.The Court also declared that the principle of relative stability had not been violated, since the share of anchovies attributed to Spain in subdivision 8 was maintained at 90 percent and that of France at 10 percent.Furthermore, honorable deputy, the Court is of the opinion that the transfer operated between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of rational and responsible exploitation of living and aquatic living resources, since the fishing pressure in subdivisions 8 and 9 does not increase or negatively affect the global share of the resources attributed to Spain.In consideration of all this, honorable deputy, the Council reiterates that without the transfer in question, in the Gulf of Biscaglia there should be an increase in the possibilities of fishing from the Eccour by France.Therefore, honorable deputy, the Council confirms that the fishing pressure would be greater and more dangerous for the fish heritage than with the solution for which it was opted.In concrete terms: 3 000 tons represent 57.5 percent of the fishing possibilities of Portugal in 2000, against 5 008 tons, equal to 73.9 percent, from 1999. These figures represent, in our opinion and in the perspective of the Council, a real improvement in terms of conservation, if compared to the 80 percent altitude established by the Council Regulation no.685/95.Question n.6, of the honorable (H-0788/99): subject: measures to meet the incessant ethnic cleaning suffered by the Serbs and Roma in Kosovo, the NATO defense ministers have launched (2,12.1999) a strong appeal for the cessation of ethnic cleaning against the Kosovo minorities.Even the European Parliament, with a resolution on the terrible acts of violence against Serbs and Roma, stigmatizes the continuous violence against the Serbian population and invites the heads of the Albanians of Kosovo to fully respect the UN resolution 1244.The resolution of the PI also highlights that previous persecutions perpetrated against the Albanians ""cannot be adduced to pretext for murders, kidnappings, detention, intimidation, fires, looting, destruction of goods, occupations of houses, etc.""."	it
Honorable deputy, I take note of his declaration and the existence of this common resolution.If the Presidency services confirm that it has been deposited, it goes without saying that it will be taken into consideration.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday, at 12.00.(The session ends at 8.14) approval of the verbal process of the previous session Mr. President I would just like to transmit information.This morning in Madrid there was a terrorist attack.They put a bomb in a car.A person is dead.I would simply like, on behalf of my group, to condemn these terrorist acts once again.Thank you, Mr Fraga.Indeed we have received news of this deplorable fact.Unfortunately, once again, assassin terrorism affects the Spanish society and the presidency of this session, being Spanish, welcomes its words, as will be able to understand, with particular intensity.(The verbal process is approved) resumption of the session declare the session of the European Parliament, interrupted on Friday 21 January 2000. Lady president, allows me to remember that tomorrow the second anniversary of the Cermis massacre occurs.Two years ago, in fact, in Italy, in Cavalese, an American plane of the NATO base in Aviano, during a low -altitude exercise - beyond the safety limits - treshed down the threads of a cable car causing the death of more than 20 European citizens.Since then the family members of the victims, who have not had the comfort of justice since the pilot responsible for the act has not had criminal consequences, await the United States at least a prompt economic compensation.I therefore address an appeal to the president of this assembly and the president of the Commission to ensure that they are guaranteed, to the US authorities, of an immediate compensation, and this in defense of the rights of the families of the victims.Thank you and take note of your intervention.Agea of ​​the day Mrs. President, I intervene to support the decision of the conference of the presidents and I take the opportunity to detect that, after publicly criticizing the presidency last January, this time I consider appropriate - also on behalf of the socialist group - the declarations pronounced by the presidency on the topic in question: we share them on the merits, in the form and in the times.We could not find more appropriate debate to apply article 50 of the regulation.This is a topical debate, urgent and of considerable relevance.To leave him space, we therefore believe it is necessary to modify the agenda.(Applause) Is there an intervention against the proposal?Mrs. President, I intend to intervene against the proposal for a matter of principle that I consider fundamental and which concerns respect for the treaties, in particular of article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty.Mrs. President, honorable colleagues, so far, on the basis of the provisions of the Treaties of Rome and Paris who have established the communities, later became the European Union, we believed that this union was an association of free, independent and sovereign states.Although numerous evolutions raised several doubts, we had believed, despite everything, in their opportunity and even recently we had alluded, albeit to a lips, we must say it, at the principle of subsidiarity.	it
"You have begun in a bold way, emphasized, rightly, in the need to focus on the so -called ""central tasks.""As you said today, that means that you must also identify the tasks, policies and programs that are peripheral or irrelevant for the main vocation of the commission.Perhaps many of the current policies and programs of the European Union have simply exceeded their expiration date or have proven heavy and difficult to direct or ineffective when applied at European level.Now the challenge is to have the value of returning as many non -central tasks to lower levels of national, regional and local government.If we want to persuade a skeptical European society of the advantages of greater European integration, we must be able to demonstrate that we stay as active in the return of unjustified community competences as in the development of new EU competencies.We must not allow those who criticize European integration to claim, as they currently do and not without some justification, as we have been able to hear from Mr. Bonde, that the increase in community competences occurs in a single sense.It must be demonstrated that it is a two -way process, in which the current community policies and programs that are not clearly justified for reasons of subsidiarity and proportionality are returned and revoked.If you are able to secondary these aspirations with actions in the coming years, you will make an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and, as we have heard today, you can have a broad support of this European Parliament.Mrs. President, Mr. President of the Commission, I totally include myself in the logic of the proposals made by my colleague Heidi Hautala regarding the strategic objectives of the Commission for the next five years.For my part, I will stick to an issue that has not addressed and that was planned, which is the work program of the Commission for this year 2000. I am aware of the limits of the exercise since we work within the framework of the current treaty and we are limited by its operating rules -especially in a special issue such as that of tax issues.But I would like not to talk about these.I will begin to greet a series of proposals that you make for this program of the year 2000. I think of all those proposals in food security that are ambitious and important, and I also think about maritime security, after two black tides that we have met along the Breton and Turkey coasts.It is good for the Commission to react rapidly on this issue.On the contrary, for other issues, I consider that it could be more ambitious, walk faster.And I would like to make a series of positive proposals, I think especially in the social sphere, in the environment and in the follow -up of Seattle.A previous observation: You have said that it is necessary to reconcile the European citizen with the institutions, it is evident, and therefore I think it is important to ask about the priority concerns of citizens.I believe, for example, that in social matters, it is not enough to announce a communication on a social actions program."	es
"In his fourteen document, there is no talk of national parliaments that are elected by the people.But it is true that they have no role to play in its strategy.He does not even have the courage to call things with their name and takes refuge behind a fashionable pseudo semantics by calling ""Gouvernance"" what else is only a federal, autocratic and central government.After trying for years to convince speaking of shared sovereignty, today confess your ultimate goal: to sell off all European, national or collective sovereignty, to a world government in which you do not even hope to obtain a prominent place.Finally, you allow yourself to condemn and sanction, or to condemn and sanction, the free democratic vote of millions of Austrians, for the only reason that the result does not take you, while at the same time you support communist China and trades with countries that for decades has clearly violated human rights.Just today the European deputies throw themselves together against a telegram by President Prodi at the Chancellor Schüssel, who, moreover, in evidence, is not a manifestation of sympathy, but a political maneuver.Your stunts do not deceive anyone, because you know very well that you like it or not, you will need Austria to reform the treaties and harmonize the tax treatment of savings.You will serve Austria to strip a little more the states of the real powers in the construction of the European Union, you will do it with cynicism, hypocrisy, but you will use Austria as a very comfortable scarecrow.It is true that you commissioners are not the only responsible: the governments that support you, by ignorance or by ideology, are equally.We are not all Brussels, as you try to make us believe, you are all.Don't even lie anymore, you don't care about the will of European peoples, free to choose only between your best worlds and the pillory.More than ten years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, your projects stink by Gulag with the addition of a tranquilism.We belong to the restricted list that denounced the communist dictatorship and we are and we remain among those who fight the Europeanist dictatorship.We appeal to all peoples of Europe so that resistance against your monstrous projects oppose.The salvation of European democracies lies in the nation state, in the nation state, that of Europe in the cooperation between its nations.(Applause from certain benches) Prodi president, she presented us today a five -year program of the Commission with many shared objectives, a program made of scenarios and themes and it is therefore right to remain, beyond the concrete moments, on the great themes.It seems to me that, from her words and from the document she has sent us, she remained in the background a theme that to her, Mr. President, like me, is very dear: solidarity, not so much internationally as an internal level.The Archbishop of Milan, Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini, is recalling all political men, and in particular those like her and me, Mr. President, who make the commitment of Catholics in politics the cultural and valiant origin of their presence, to reconsider a theme of development that, beyond the economic profit, look with great, great attention, to the last, to the excluded."	it
In this context, we must control what happens with the port in Gaza, with the northern route of transit between Gaza and the West Bank, with the continuation of the release of security prisoners and with the fulfillment of economic commitments.The second point refers to Syria.In this, the limit matter is essential.We still do not know anything about the result of the negotiations.However, the important thing is that they have started.An important issue in this context is the distribution of waters.Golán is currently supplied between a third and seventh part of Israel's water.The third aspect is the peace conversations in Syria, which are closely linked to the withdrawal of Israel from the south of Lebanon.According to Unifil data, there are concrete signs that Israel prepares a withdrawal, which we celebrate.Other controversial issues are also water supply and the situation of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.My last point is the future Palestinian state.It is possible that it is believed this year, with or without the support of Israel.The Barak government has implied that it is prepared to sign a peace agreement with a State.Although peace negotiations have not completed in September of this year, there are no impediments in the treaties for the creation of the Palestinian State after this date.In this context, it is important for those of us who support this idea, that what the commissioner Patten pointed out, that is, a state with transparency and democratic.We all want to contribute to it.Mr. President, I would like to refer first to the common resolution that will be prepared as a conclusion of this debate, to which my group has contributed and that we naturally approve.But, more specifically, I want to express our satisfaction here due to the fact that Israel and Syria, after so long, have re -established conversations to solve their opinion differences.Recent negotiations already constitute an important step in the direction of a permanent peace in the Middle East.That is why the peace conversations have been interrupted currently.Both parties must truly make a immense effort.Durable peace in the region can only be achieved through an agreement in which the security of the borders of Israel and the integrity of Syria is guaranteed.For this, the beginning of stable diplomatic relations and a constant dialogue is necessary.In addition to bilateral meetings with Syria, I hope that, in a predictable period of time, Israel also begins negotiations with Lebanon and that, within the framework of economic and regional cooperation, it is possible to adopt a multilateral approach.However, we must continue to regret the fact that the European Union, one of the most important financial donors, is not always able to play an influential political role in the peace process.This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of common foreign policy and security of the European Union.	es
"By not introducing this environmental dimension in data management, the Commission could prohibit unilaterally, and at its discretion, the use of this or talaltro fishing tool.Amendment no.4 specifies the obligation that falls on the scientific experts to elaborate and transmit all the data to the competent authorities, including national and regional authorities, in order to contribute to the decision -making process.Amendment no.5 allows you to soften the Commission's proposal.In fact, the information requested from the authorities must be reasonable, in order to allow to reach an operational knowledge of the fishing activity without harming the fundamental right to confidentiality, for example in the tax field, where there is no community competence.Amendment no.6 aims to make the commission's participation more binding in the control procedure.It is necessary that all the data are transmitted annually and that the Commission regularly takes the point of the overall results.Finally, amendment no.7 obliges the Commission to draw up a report by the end of 2001. Since the reform of the common fishing policy is set for 2002, all political actors must view the information on which the Commission's proposal will be based.HUDGHTON report (A5-0036/2000) - (FR) the modification of the directive, as presented to us by the Commission, is important, since it deals with a specific pathology, the infectious anemia of salmon, a contagious viral disease that is transmitted through water through organic substances such as blood, feces, mucus, etc.There is no scientific tests that confirm the possibility of a vertical transmission of the disease through eggs or fish milk.However, we know that other species, such as trout, eel or herring, can be carriers of the virus without being affected by it.This pathology was isolated in 1984 in Norway and in 1996 in Canada.In any case, since the virus does not survive at a temperature greater than 26ºC, it does not represent any danger to humans.The disease, which mainly affects the Scottish Salmon sector, has been identified in this region in May 1998. Today, ISA affects 240 salmonid manufacturers and it is therefore important to circumscribe the disease in order to prevent all companies operating in the aquaculture sector in the various Member States of the European Union.The Council's proposal is aimed at establishing a progressive elimination system of fish affected by the disease and a vaccination program.As for the progressive elimination system, we can only be in favor of the proposal.It is essential to help companies interested in ""cleaning"" the outbreak of infection, thus avoiding the spread of the disease and promoting the commercial movements of live fish.As for vaccination, it should be remembered that the directive initially prohibited the use of vaccines against ISA.With the new proposal, the commission would be in favor of authorizing its use, but for the moment, no vaccines of this type have not yet been discovered.The usefulness of the proposal is therefore at least limited, if only in the short deadline.Canada has a vaccine that proved to be effective in 76 percent of cases, but, since the Canadian strain is different from the European one, the vaccine in question cannot be used as it is in Europe."	it
"The forced convergence of different systems, in addition to clashing with the principle of subsidiarity, Mr. President, I do not think will lead to the desired result, because ultimately there will always be the way to get around the system, with harmful results for the environment.Mr. President, five million solid waste every day are thrown out of the ships.These waste float for the seas and end up on the beaches, causing serious damage to the environment and marine flora and fauna.The consequence is that millions of birds and one hundred thousand marine mammals and sea turtles die every year.The Marpol Convention aims to prevent pollution caused by ships but it is clear that legislation is also required to guarantee its application.Hence the relief of the directive in question and that's why tonight are happy with the progress made during the Council in view of reaching a common position that obliges ships to deliver the waste produced by them to structures for the collection of waste in ports.I also congratulate the speaker, whose commitment reflects the strength and passion with which our commission faces this specific problem and the strong transversal desire for parliamentarians of all political groups so that it is put an end to these disastrous practices for the environment.I welcome with particular favor to its fierce support for the proposal according to which the environmental requirements should apply to all ships regardless of the flag that beat and that in all the ports of the community should be made available adequate structures for the collection of waste, all this in order to improve the prevention of pollution and to avoid distortions of competition.An aspect on which the parliamentarians of the British Labor Party do not agree with the speaker is the way in which to apply the principle of the ""polluting pays"".We strongly support this principle, but we believe that its application can be made more efficient if the Member States will keep the freedom to decide what the tariff system most suitable for particular circumstances is.For example, in the UK we have a system that works well, according to which the ship pays the operator in charge of the collection of waste every time it makes use of its collection structures, without any involvement of the port.This system is based on a consent achieved by all interested parties, with the participation of ports and environmental organizations such as RSPB and WWF.However, in the same way as the speaker we absolutely do not want different tariff systems to increase the risk of pollution of the seas.Here is the reason why we support the Council with its proposal to strengthen the revision clause, to ensure regular control of the impact of the directive.Mr. President, those who have been able to witness the ruinous effects on the environment from the Enerika disaster will certainly not be able to vote against a relationship that has as its object the disposal of the combustible residues of the boats.It is a relationship of exceptional importance.In this regard, it should be emphasized that what is missing most is no legislation.All EU countries have signed the so -called Marpol Convention, while the countries overlooking the Baltic have also signed the Helsinki Convention.Both respond in order to avoid exhausts at sea.However, it is necessary to improve access to reception systems and create the incentive to use it."	it
Mr. President, estimated and dear colleagues, Mr. Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new EU-ACP agreement is an important step towards greater coherence.And it is positive that in this new agreement, criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law or Good Government, that past colonial relations no longer permeate both most of our relations are established more than so far but that these political criteria have obtained a greater weight here.Well this is the previous condition for any development.If these criteria are not respected, the development will not have any opportunity.This, Colega Modrow, is also applicable to Cuba.I greet that Cuba approaches this process, but some transformations have to occur in that country.We all know the reports of Amnesty International.It may be that you, as one of the last holders of the power of communism, possibly see it differently from most of this assembly and that you see problems in the Good Government.However, it is an important criterion for the European Union.I want to refer to a second topic.We are talking here about coherence.Many colleagues have exhibited examples of to what extent the various policies are not consistent.But, from my point of view, the development policy itself needs some more coherence.It is not consistent that the coordination with the Member States remains without working, that in developing countries member countries of the European Union carry out in part some very opposite projects.Nor is it consistent in front of the European taxpayer that we carry out a development policy that is regulated in the Budget of the Union but that the Fed is still outside.Mr. President of the Council, if you get that these 13,500 million euros are subjected in the future to the control of Parliament, of the Budget Control Commission, are subjected to mechanisms such as the OLAF, then I think it will raise the degree of acceptance.I think this should also be a requirement to the Intergovernmental Conference: the establishment of the Fed in the European Union budget.Mr. President, ladies, as a whole, this text seems effectively well intentionally and, however, we do not vote in commission nor will we vote in the plenary, for two reasons that, otherwise, gave rise, of our part, to amendments that I would like to develop here quickly.First of all, the Development and Cooperation Commission wishes to the community of the European Development Fund and it is evident that in this regard it is wrong.Cooperation is and, in our opinion, must continue to be an intergovernmental exercise.At the time Europe prepares its extension, a community of the European Development Fund would allow some to easily hide their lack of commitment behind the community budget screen, not counting, on the other hand, that in this way a fruitful and promising way to associate our cooperation policy to our southern partners is suppressed.Finally, the Commission demonstrated, recently, as Mrs. Maes, the difficulties she experiences to manage the funds she dedicated to its development and humanitarian aid programs has just remembered.	es
While we thought the discussion ended, dazzling amendments reach the plenary, for which I would like to reject.After that, for example, we should finance the art treasures or promote marine tourism with the meager household of fishing.Other amendments, such as number 4, which require the financing of biological recovery phases, also prove a great ignorance of fishing regulations if they demand measures that are already in force, even if everything is still in need of improvement.I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments brought in and to conclude the chapter on fishing and environment with the idea presented in the debate in the committee, namely that both are in close relationships and suffer from the effects of the same attack on the environment.As I have said so many times, fisheries are more victim as the cause of destruction of the sea ecosystem, and tomorrow, in the pronunciation about the Erika, we will have the opportunity to prove this.President!The report by Mr. Katiforis had preferred a message in which the Commission was limited to listing a number of good wishes, but to admit their inability to their practical implementation, to fill with liveliness, polemics and controversial spirit.What Mr. Katiforis was not missing was the courage to demonstrate the measures that, in his opinion, could contribute to the relaxation and maintenance of the natural resources of the sea.I say this from the non -understanding of many of his suggestions because I am one of those who believe that not only resources are important in fishing - they are - but also the people who have had this job for centuries.I agree with the rapporteur that a stronger coordination of European fishing and environmental policy is required.But what we basically miss is courage and political determination on the part of the Commission and the Member States to make decisions and apply the already valid regulation.Not only fishing and the environment should be integrated, but also maritime traffic, employment or energy.With regard to the structural funds, I could mention a number of examples here, but I will rescue that for another opportunity.The European Parliament is aware of the limitation of resources and the need to carry out responsible fishing.It demands strictness by the Commission and the Member States to comply with TAC and the quotas defined according to objective scientific criteria and demand that everyone is measured with the same level.As Mr. Katiforis says, the repellents are a waste of resources that we must not accept.Twenty million tons of non -usable catches are thrown back.The fleet must be equipped with fishing devices for ever more selective fishing.This parliament has already opposed the drift nets, and yet we determine how certain states not only disregard the obligation of their elimination, but also increase the number of ships with this fishing device or simply do not transmit any data in view of the passivity of the national and community authorities.We socialists believe that the defense of common fishing policy means to stand up for regulated and controlled fishing activity.It is essential that the Commission initiates an information campaign via the GFP with this message.	de
The next point is the actions we have undertaken.As you know, the Portuguese presidency has already composed a high -level group, which will present its first report in June, at the summit.The Portuguese presidency focuses on two issues: on sustainable pension systems and social insertion.I believe that the proposal on a group corresponding to the Parliament level is very positive and can contribute to advance one more step after the approval of this high -level group.In certain observations on the role of social protection systems and on their cost, and on the role that these systems play in the competitiveness of the Member States, I would like to observe that what they try to combine policies in the European Union is competitiveness and social cohesion.Naturally, we must take into account the issue of competitiveness, and social protection planning must be done in such a way that social protection is a factor of economic expansion and employment.And I think this is evident in the text of the communication.Ladies and lords, the objective is that next year, after the unanimous decision of the Council, we advance in a first level of coordination, exchange of opinions, registration of social problems, creation of a database for the best coordination of policies.As many of the Messrs. Deputies have expressed, I think we have taken an important first step.Already at the Intergovernmental Conference the social policy issues are faced in a broader way, and I think we are in a new phase, where social policy will constitute, to a large extent, a European policy.Thank you very much, Mrs. Diamantopoulou.The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 am.WIPO Treaty In accordance with the agenda, the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) of Mrs. Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Commission of Legal Affairs and Internal Market, on the decision proposal of the Council (com (1998) 249 - C5-022/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC))) isof the Ompi Treaty on copyright and the Ompi treaty on interpretations or executions and phonograms..(SV) Mr. President, we are going to make a decision in an important issue, an international agreement, an issue that may have an influence on the development of well -being in many countries.In my country, Sweden, concerns one of the largest export sectors.The bouquets affect are those of music and phonograms.This is the copyright of the artists, to protect their artistic creations.This is the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Perfomance and Phonograms Treaty).Without copyright protection, economic incentives and creativity are stopped.The falsifications are Big Business.It is believed that only in Europe revenues of four thousand five hundred million euros are lost due to pirate copies.The problem affects many jobs in the entertainment world.This treaty is historical, since the EU is one of the parts that has signed it.That's right, although the members of the organization are the states of the Union and not the EU.	es
And here we approach the heart of the matter: this project related to social harmonization not only touches social policy, it is a monitoring of the UEM community project that has a very specific interest in the three countries that remain outside and that can be saved from this Titanic, that is, Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark and hence the importance that for us it has to emphasize that we cannot support a proposal whose logical basis is to consolidate the project ofEMA.Mr. President, I have voted in favor of the commission of the Commission on the modernization of social protection because, in my opinion, it is in the direction - although it does not completely achieve it - to finally offer European legislation in the social and pension sphere.I have heard with regret the previous explanation of vote, since I consider that the spirit of this report is oriented to the possibility of protecting even more, if possible, the elderly.And this, although we know that the governments of the fifteen Member States would like to reduce the amount of pensions to the maximum.I hope that as soon as possible, Parliament has the power to legislate in pensions.Older people are confident that European Parliament allows them to live well and dignity and better than now.The least developed nations must reach the same level of states that, within the European Union, guarantee greater social protection.- (DA) Danish social democrats in the European Parliament have voted today in favor of our Swedish partner, the social democrat Jan Andersson on the communication of the commission.A concerted strategy to modernize social protection.The communication of the Commission takes as a starting point the implementation of the EMA, which with its claim of stability and growth creates the basis for member states to affirm their social security systems.The report is left sitting that modernization does not mean to reduce the level of social protection, but to better make the existing resources.In addition, we have also noticed that in the exposure of reasons it is established that a modernization also does not mean a harmonization of social security systems and that also a harmonization would be harmful since it could require higher levels in weaker Member States and, at the same time, for reasons of competition, it could press the socially more developed states to make reductions in the social security system.A situation with which no one would benefit.In both the communication of the commission and in the report of Mr. Andersson, it is underlined that they are the Member States responsible and with it who decide the content of the Social Security systems.The collaboration in these issues under the Auspices of the EU must provide added value, based on the exchange of experiences, the mutual evaluation of policies development for setting a better practice..(SV) We believe that the report contains many good practical proposals, to which we give our support, but we are very critical regarding the convergence perspective that characterizes the report.	es
"Still today there are no certain answers on the control of atomic plants in the republics of the East.It is therefore necessary to have resources to be spent before proceeding with an expansion, to finally give life to a European control force, in charge of verifying quality and living conditions, in order to create a new world in which some tragedies no longer have to occur.I would also like to spend a word on Africa, lady president.The third and fourth world are abandoned: a dollar, one and a half euros, would be enough to save many children.Europe so democratic, so progressive, is silent and does not take care of these tragic problems, while half Africa dies of AIDS and other diseases.One last consideration as regards the Internet and globalization.The globalization of the economy cannot become homologation of products and qualities, as well as the globalization of politics cannot become flattening values, hopes, enthusiasm.The peoples who do not participate, and slowly move away, leave room for an oligarchy that takes power and leaves control to a few.As for the Internet: Europe finally has the courage to say that rules need.At this moment I allow me, by personal, to direct my applause to those pirates who, acting as they are acting, force the world to reflect on the only system that today has no rules.We are the world of rules: we also give rules to the Internet, thus giving rules and hopes to the future of our fellow citizens.Lady president, as a taxpayer from Padano I have already known the grip of the taxator Prodi, then head of government in Italy, to which Padania also fiscally subject to.I listened to it now with concern, when he mentioned new resources, a concept quietly translatable in the imposition of new taxes and new taxes, in sight, among other things, of the expansion, that is, of the entry of new states in the Union.But why don't they pay their entrance ticket to them?My Po valley voters who, thanks to Prodi, have already paid for what in Italy is known as a tax on Europe - only partially returned - have absolutely no intention, always thanks to Prodi, to pay another for someone else.Mrs. President, Mr. President of the Commission, commissioners, five months after his settlement, the Commission has put the direction in white in which he intends to push the European Union.The result is a certainly ambitious document, but also a pompous.Isn't it pathetic to say that ""the world looks to Europe""?In addition, the European continent is not only composed of the fifteen Member States of the European Union.Say that you want to guarantee peace, democracy and respect for human rights in, well known, all of Europe seems to me somewhat ambitious and fascinates me above all to know how the commission intends to achieve this goal.The European integration model as a form of global government, I wonder if this means perhaps the export of a model based on the concentration of power on a large scale.The Commission believes that foreign policy can be successful as long as everyone knows exactly who is that he commands!But who is it that commands?"	it
"Mr. President, the Commissioner, the peace process in the Middle East is an extremely delicate question.The exact boundaries of the State of Israel, the only democracy in this region, can only be recognized by all if these negotiations lead.The implementation of the trade agreement between the European Union and Israel, which no longer defines the territory of the State of Israel, must be done in this context.Add to this the existence of a close link between economic activities on the Israeli side and those on Palestinian territory.To this end, the Paris protocol annexed to the Oslo agreements also provides for a customs ""envelope"" which includes the state of Israel and the Palestinian authority.In addition, the commission and the aforementioned parties have agreed that a joint labor group is set up to approach issues of origin, in particular the fact that the Palestinian economy felt of unilateral approaches from the European Union.Potential investors in this region have already said that they will retire if the joint ventures no longer have the preference.Mr. President, this assembly generally shares the concern raised in the question of Madame Morgantini.I believe that Commissioner Verorino clearly expressed the position of the Commission and, in my opinion, responded adequately to the concerns here aroused, but it seems to me that we should not stop there.This is why it seems to me that we could, from this assertion, expand the convergent points based on the precious information that Madame Morgantini and I were able to deduct during a visit to the region with the president of Parliament.I first believe that, despite the existing difficulties that we have seen in situ, we must reiterate our support for direct dialogue between the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, with a view to a fair, stable and final peace agreement.Secondly, I think that the two parties have an interest in ensuring the economic development of the region and in firmly facing the reduction of the significant wealth imbalances observed in the region.Third, finally, the Commission could perhaps take into account the usefulness of deepening the task of a trilateral working group, of course with the participation of the European Union, guaranteeing compliance with trade agreements and making us progress in the cooperation that the European Union offers for the benefit of all the parties concerned.I listened to the response from Commissioner Vitorino and I must say that I am satisfied.I think his intervention answers the questions contained in the question.I too believe that we must underline the importance, for the European Union and therefore, from the executive point of view, for the Commission, to promote tripartite activities, in particular with regard to the levels of economic and scientific cooperation, so that our quantitative presence in pecuniary terms can more often transform into a more significant presence in the Middle East.Here, I believe, the lesson to be drawn from this already old story.As for the specific object, I heard that Mr. Galeote referred to the visit of our president and Mr. Menéndez del Valle to that of the Prodi President in Israel and in other countries of the Middle East."	fr
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr. Guterres for his explanations this evening as well as for his initiative with regard to the summit in Lisbon, which is very important to us.If we are honest, we have to admit that it was a long way from the employment summit in Luxembourg to the summit in Lisbon, and that we can now expect concrete results from this summit in Lisbon, so something tangible has to come out.Many European citizens sit in the grandstand tonight, and I wonder what they may think of today's discussion.I hope that these citizens will leave the plenum in the certainty this evening that the institutions of the European Union have now initiated a process that will truly lead to restoring full employment in the European Union.There are many challenges in front of us on the way to full employment.Some of these challenges will be difficult to cope with, but it is important that we have been implementing what we have been talking about for many, many years, namely full employment, a society without social exclusion, a society of innovation and knowledge.This lies the great challenge and the great importance of the Lisbon summit.I would like to briefly go into some key aspects, with the help of which we will be able to have our words follow.Firstly, we have to define corner values ​​and initiate a mutual evaluation process, we have to set goals, real goals that we can achieve, and we have to bring the governments to the courage that requires some courage, in which they say: ""Yes, we do not shy away from the comparison, we will be measured with the rest of the world.""Nobody pleasant.However, it is important if the summit in Lisbon is to lead to concrete results and not in a different direction - a direction that Prime Minister Guterres certainly does not want to strike because he is really interested in the fact that something is achieved at the summit in Lisbon.Other areas must also not be neglected.This includes the challenge of creating an ""e-Europe"" in which all citizens are involved and in which nobody falls by the wayside.Another area is the creation of a real internal market, which we still don't have, and qualification measures are part of the fact that it is of central importance for the introduction of an innovative knowledge society.This requires difficult decisions, but I would like to contact the citizens again in the grandstand who pursue this pronunciation and to whom I would like to give confidence that we will achieve a fully employed society that the summit in Lisbon will be at the end of a long way and will provide concrete results.I welcome the new strategic goal to make Europe the most dynamic and most competitive space.Who could question such an ambitious goal?However, I would like to point out that dynamics and entrepreneurial spirit as well as social cohesion are ambitious goals, not to mention the creative area of ​​tension between these two goals."	de
"I do not believe that in Europe there is a broad consensus in favor of the introduction of the qualified majority on taxation, justice and internal and foreign affairs at the level of union.Pursuant to article 99 of the Treaty of Rome, the tax decisions approved at European level must be voted unanimously.I believe that this provision should remain in force, since a common tax code would instead reduce the functioning of the European Union.I am in favor of the expansion of the European Union.They are in favor of institutional changes that allow to implement expansion in a structured and simplified way.However, we must not forget that public opinion of 370 million citizens of the European Union is a fundamental factor to keep in mind if you want to change the treaties.The changes must not be introduced too quickly and must not be too radical, otherwise public opinion will oppose the ratification of any future treaty of the union.President President, I will speak on behalf of the Italian radical deputies.Mr. President of the Commission, you said a little while ago that no political structure produces five -year plans.This is true, if we think of the plans of Russia of the 1930s, but she himself a few months ago, at the beginning of his mandate, announced to the conference of the presidents who would instead have presented a legislature program, or the broad lines of the European government that you presides, and in whose exercise we are committed today.Then, if the government program or the tendential program must be, the analysis of the document that you have distributed us and the speech that has accompanied it is more than anything else a catalog of good intentions or, better to say, of problems on the carpet, without however giving the impression that the commission clearly takes a position on any of these points, that is, it absolves that task that is proper to the European Commission.In the classroom of this parliament, in the past, great debates on great strategic options that the Commission, by virtue of its initiative, launched, more than as a ballon of essai, as proposals that then made more or less road, but which still contributed to the integration and development of the European Union, had.In this case, Mr. President, we certainly have a decalogue: a whole series of problems have been enumerated but, he allows me, with the impression that on none of these the commission in some way dare to say ""on this it would be necessary to do so"".Only on one point it seems to me that you have insisted a lot - I think too much - that is, about the fact that almost the task you are prefiguring yourself as a priority is to dismantle the ""unnecessary"" activities.We are careful, however, Mr. President, because we had a crisis of confidence in the Commission and we focused on this commission - the majority, at least, of this Parliament he focused on this commission - precisely because, first of all, the reform of the Commission was linked to a strengthening, to a new identity, to a new awareness of being guided again by a safe hand."	it
".(SV) Mr. President, Mrs. Minister, Mrs. Commissioner, ""women hold half the sky,"" said a man of success.But in the case of political decisions and priorities, female voices are absent.Women, which constitute more than half of the population, are not sufficiently represented in the political, social and economic sector.This is unacceptable in a democracy!The greatest abyss in terms of equal opportunities, jure and de facto, is found in the decision -making process.To achieve a balance, a specific action plan is required, with a fixed calendar.The benchmarking system would be an important part of this action plan, to ensure full female participation in power and decision -making structures.Therefore, I am satisfied that the curator agrees with a system of this nature.I propose that the objectives for women in the decision -making process are based on the average of the three member states that have obtained more success in each sector, and each Member State must inform annually.Subsequently, these reports must be evaluated.Women are the main victims of human rights abuses such as violations, sexual abuse, ill -treatment at home and white trafficking, but are not sufficiently represented in judicial and legislative bodies that judge those crimes.This implies that there are no priority to these crimes and that the authors are often not punished.Women are the main victims of armed conflicts, but are absent in actions to maintain peace, conflict resolution and reconstruction work.Therefore, in the resolution we urge the Member States to increase the proportion of women in activities to resolve conflicts and for the maintenance of peace.Female participation in equal situation is not only a claim of social justice and democracy, but it is also a duty, to achieve that the experiences and knowledge of women are fully taken into account.Not having the ability of women in the decision -making process is an unacceptable waste.Women should not only ""support half of the sky"" but also must have the right to assume responsibilities on earth.Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Presidency of the Council and the Commissioner for the excellent interventions they have made today.We expect much of your performance.We begin a millennium and a century that will be - we hope - determinants for women and for their possibility of occupying decision positions.We want this possibility to contribute important modifications to our life in society, that democracy is also synonymous with equality between men and women and that they are not excluded or socially, as still happens today.And that, thus, values ​​that are expensive to women - such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security, defense of the environment - predominantly orient life in the European Union and, if possible, in the world.For that, it is necessary to provide women with the opportunity to intervene against the inertia of a society so far imbued with male values."	es
"This is a problem of compatibility between our VFU directives and old guidelines, among others the self-oil, which we voted for a few years ago.We can therefore be satisfied with the common sense of which the commission for the environment, public health and the policy for consumers, which reintroduced, to dispel any doubts, has proven the exception relating to the vintage cars that are part of our industrial and cultural heritage.To conclude, I will say that this directive is not sufficiently ambitious to solve the problems related to the current car park but instead it is rather hypocritical for the fate that reserves for abandoned cars that still clutters our forests, our lakes, our gardens.Once again the ""polluting pays"" principle is not applied and the taxpayer is always paying.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, reading the leaflets distributed in recent weeks, one might think that we have been discussing the maximum acceptable ecological risk or on the death of the automotive industry in Europe.Neither hypotheses is exact.We must be objective: the directive in question is valid;It implies ecological progress in Europe and we can be proud to translate this directive into law and to launch it.In any case, there is a point on which we disagree.Perhaps, considering the dimension of the directive, it represents a small point, but it is on this that the controversy takes place.These are the costs related to recycling.In this regard, we clearly distance ourselves from the debate held in the council last year, during which the gratuity for the last holder and the problem of funding were mixed in a single cauldron, and the free of charge was questioned for the last holder.In February last year, Parliament decided - and to this decision we stick to the PSE group - that the gratuity for the last holder is out of the question!But who has to pay for vehicles to be disposed of?It is evident for us that in the case of new vehicles these costs must be incurred by the manufacturer, because in this way it will also be led to design and build easily recyclable vehicles.But what happens with the vehicles that are already in circulation?An example: if it were responsible for all its out -of -use vehicles, the Rover based in the United Kingdom would be responsible for 5.8 million vehicles in the European Union and should immediately set aside 250 million euros to face the costs related to recycling, while a Korean manufacturer who builds similar vehicles should only put aside of the ""peanuts"", as a representative of the Deutsche Bank said.These are distortions of the competition that have nothing to do with the protection of the environment, but affect only on the ability to invest and on the jobs of the European automotive industry.In this sense, we propose to create a fund for out of use vehicles with which to pay the costs inherent in the recycling of these vehicles, so as to respect the principle of gratuity.I understand colleagues from countries without automotive industry which argue that the entire burden should fall on the producers and that the problem of the distortions of the competition with the related provisions does not interest them."	it
For two years, such fears have materialized.The dispute of bananas is its most striking proof.The developing countries are asked to align on the liberalization of exchanges, despite the fragility of their economies.If the report of the Honorable Corrie denounces this situation well and reaffirms the loyalty of the joint assembly to the Lomé model, it does not underline enough, however, a second problem that, to be honest, derives in turn from the freedom error: the inconsistency of the regional commercial agreements concluded by the European Union.The cooperation agreement with South Africa is the best example.The Council, in fact, approved this agreement, negotiated by the Commission, at the same time when the agricultural chapter, although essential, was not yet finalized.As the honorable Paul-Marie Coûteaux, in his intervention of yesterday and in his proposals for amendment, was very correctAll this worries a lot, especially since it seems to promise an agreement of the same type also with Mexico.Likewise it is not possible to support the speaker when he requests the merger of the European Development Fund in the Community Budget.In fact, we want to maintain the clear commitment and responsibility of each Member State that only the intergovernmental character can guarantee.We have witnessed too many examples, unfortunately, of hijacking the collective aid of which no one feels responsible, and we do not intend to extend this disastrous practice also to the European Development Fund.Lady president, I welcome the Corrie report who represents a equilibrated evaluation of the work done last year by this assembly.The report comes immediately after the agreement for the renewal of the current agreement of Lomé, which expires at the end of the month.The new agreement provides for allocations for development for 13.5 billion euros over the next seven years;It is essential that this money is used in favor of the poorest groups and individuals of ACP countries.It is also necessary to work without stopping to eradicate corruption and waste and it is also necessary to involve civil society in the planning and application of these projects.The decision to include a clause that requires ACP countries to resume illegally emigrated people in Europe is worrying;This clause must be applied with extreme caution.I hope that before the expiry of this new Lomé convention we will be able to welcome Cuba as a fully member.According to the United Nations joint program estimates for AIDS, 33.4 million people affected by HIV were at the end of 1998 in the world.More than 95 percent of all infected individuals live in developing countries, and sub -Sasaharan Africa is the most affected region in the world.Only 10 percent of the world population lives in sub -Saharan Africa, but 70 percent of all people who contracted the AIDS virus in 1998. 80 percent of 13.9 million deaths caused by AIDS all over the world has occurred in this region.In Africa, AIDS is not only a public or private health problem, but it is a development node.	it
"The sub -opening of women in politics, for example, continues to be a reality.Still, we all recognize the importance of an ever greater commitment of women in politics.Only women are able to invent policies capable of modifying structures elaborated by men for other men, because they are precisely the structural discrimination those with which women must most clash, whether they are politics or the employment market.It is therefore up to the European political parties to open up to women.The same article 191 of the Treaty (ex 138 a) underlines its role as, and I mention, ""an important factor for integration within the Union"".And the article continues by stating that ""they [political parties] contribute to forming a European consciousness [as well as a European identity] and to express the political will of the citizens of the Union"".Such a provision, although not having legal value, remains extremely symbolic, as it gives political parties an important role in the construction of a democratic Europe that could materialize, for example, in the implementation of positive actions and in the promotion of equality within our political parties.On the occasion of the European elections of 1999, some parties presented equal lists.Well, it is a good practice that is necessary to generalize.I don't know if there is a causal bond, but it is true that the proportion of the deputies to the European Parliament went from 25.7 percent in 1994 to 29.9 percent in 1999, not to mention that, from the 1999 elections, Parliament is chaired by a woman.I will end by resuming the conclusions taken from the Conference of April 1999 organized by the Commission, whose title was ""Women and men in power"".Equality between men and women is not a problem that only affects women, it is a challenge that involves all our society!It has recently been taken forward with the increase in female participation in the decision -making organs in the union.Today, in our institution, 30 percent of the elected representatives is made up of women, including the lady president of the European Parliament, while Finland has just chosen a women's president.On average, the governments of the Member States are composed for a quarter of women and national parliaments for more than a fifth.This is far from being satisfactory, given that the figures vary a lot from one country to another and that the Nordic countries have a decidedly greater female representation in key places in terms of responsibility and decision -making competence.It is above all a question of approach and respect for the quality and abilities that women can make to society, and not of a system of fixed shares.In general, my group is not in favor of the use of the shares since in the long run they could be counterproductive and even undermining the cause they intend to support.This is nevertheless recognizing that experience varies from country to country and that the use of said system could be justified as a temporary measure to rebalance the female presence where women are scarcely represented.We decided to vote for the resolution of women in the decision -making process that was adopted in commemoration of the International Women's Day of 8 March and in which ten amendments presented by the liberal group were incorporated and the references to the shares were attenuated, in line with the approach described above."	it
The measures are not limited to legislation.To promote and support the dialogue as a cornerstone of successful adaptation to change, the Commission is currently also dealing with the recommendations of the Lillehammer report by working on the establishment of a European observation center for industrial change.We also deal with another proposal of this group of experts, with the report on the management of change.Finally, let me go into some of the other questions that are addressed in the defense draft presented in this high house.As far as the connection between competition and social policy is concerned, I would like to remind you that there is a provision in the merger control regulation that gives employee representatives the opportunity to be heard by the Commission as part of the corresponding procedure.On the whole, we recognize the need that in the different instances of all aspects associated with such measures, including their consequences for employment, due attention is paid.As an example, I mention that the public authorities, in particular the Commission, on the way of guidelines for the national regional allowance, which took effect on January 1 of this year, have already taken action to ensure that the provision of public funds will continue to be linked to the recipients of regional allowances and consequently to the jobs associated with the investment.For this purpose, any regional allowance is made dependent on the existence of the respective investment for a minimum period of five years.The same provision was included in the regulation on the structural funds, so that it applies to all investments co -financed for all of the structural funds.The social cohesion and the interaction of politics at the EU level are the focus of the upcoming Lisbonian summit.I know we will come back to these questions in the future to see how best we can make sure that our policies will be adapted and reformed in order to support economic and social progress in Europe.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner.Mr. Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I see that you report to the rules of procedure.If it is a personal explanation, would you please wait until the end of this pronunciation?I would like to give you the word.President!It is a question of public honor in this parliament, it is not a personal explanation.This morning, the Parliamentary President, Ms. Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to let me speak about the rules of procedure.Unfortunately, this is not the first time that the Ms. President behaved towards me in this inadmissible way.The President of the President has thus violated Article 142, according to which a request for rules of procedure has priority in front of all other requests to speak.She also violated Article 122, which gives all members of this house the right to personal remarks, with which the statements of another MP who are rejected by Ms. Vidal-Quadra.This partisan behavior of our president should be criticized with all reprint.I am always ready to accept the apology from the President of the President.Thank you for your explanation.Of course, we will ensure that the president is informed about her explanation.I can assure you that, according to my knowledge, the President is always reluctant to give a topic -related pronunciation in the middle of a vote.	de
.(SV) Mr. President, I think it is very important to show the guidelines for the use of the principle of precaution in this communication, as a way to refute the claims that we always apply it with protectionist objectives.I am sure that there will be more conflicts, for example, with the USA we cannot be naive and believe anything else.However, since we signed the Montreal protocol, we have an international recognition and a common definition established in a protocol on the environment, health and commerce.That is why it constitutes a good example.Let's not think that in the future there will be no conflicts, but then we can demonstrate that we do not arbitrarily apply the precautionary principle.Now there are a number of guidelines for their application and we have the strong support of our peoples to do so, which is very clearly corroborated in this communication.Thank you very much, Mrs. curator.The attention paid to the principle of political caution has made us debate it for almost two hours and that now this issue is considered, to put it in some way, more of ordinary administration, although, as we have been able to verify following the interventions, the questions and the answers, it is an issue that is attributed a lot of importance.The debate is closed.Intergovernmental Conference In accordance with the agenda, the report of the Report (A5-0018/2000) of the Messrs. Dimitrakopoulos E Leinen, on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Commission, on the call of the Intergovernmental Conference (14094/199 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825 (CNS))..(The) Mr. President, first of all, my thanks to the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for the useful contacts we have maintained during all this time.Also allow me to thank my presentation partner, Mr. Leinen, for our extraordinary collaboration.Mr. President, Lords, the intergovernmental conference that will begin is important in general terms, and especially in the perspective of expansion.From his works the structure and mechanisms that will base the functioning of 21st century Europe will arise.And there is no doubt that a more effective, more democratic and fully transparent functioning of the European Union of the future demands a broad and deep reform, both of its institutions and its working methods.Budget and main condition for the success of this reform is the agenda that will guide the works of the Intergovernmental Conference.From the decisions taken in the European Council of Helsinki it turns out that the order of the day agreed there is not satisfactory and does not guarantee the substantial changes necessary for the creation of a more functional, more effective, more democratic, more transparent Europe.And this because it is limited to the examination of only three issues that concern in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of only two institutional organs of the European Union.I will not repeat it since it is well known to all.This finding of mine is justified, on the one hand, for the permanently raised demand, sometimes with special intensity, by European citizens;And on the other hand, for the enormous challenges that the Grand Company undertaken by the European Union, the expansion company.	es
"I consider this to be a report in which the cooperation between the committees worked very well, and the result that we have today is a sober, factual report in a particularly delicate area.Soberness and objectivity, which are therefore particularly necessary in the development of Article 280.4.Because if we would have to award a price for the article, which is most difficult to understand, the least clear, most unclear - as you want to describe it - then there would certainly be a hard competition because the contract is a model collection of complicated articles, but this is without a doubt one of the most promising candidates.At the same time, it is a particularly delicate question because it concerns the protection of the financial interests of the community, as Ms. Theato said very correctly.We are all aware of the necessity - and this parliament has raised this concern or has been a great pioneer in this matter - to protect the financial interests of the community.But be careful, as the French say, ""ne jettons pas le bébé avec l'auu du bain"", you must not release the child with the bathing, that is, when protecting the financial interests of the community, on the one hand - and Ms. Theato said - the responsibilities of the nation states have to respect, but also other things that concern the citizens that affect the essential guarantees.You will be preserved without restrictions by the conclusions of the report Theato.Therefore, I hope in my capacity as chair of the committee for law and internal market and of course also in my capacity as a member of the parliament that this parliament supports the report with a large majority tomorrow and that it will experience a good implementation through the Commission.Mr President, as Ms. Theato stated, this report touches a critical topic.This report was proposed by the budget control Committee and developed as a initiative report.One of the reasons, which is why we absolutely wanted to do something, is that the European Union is still said to be fraud and mismanagement, whether we like it or not.Sometimes it is exaggerated, but there is something on the allegations and we have to do something about it.Some of the measures we have decided in the past are ignored by some Member States.We must not forget that the Member States are responsible for the implementation of the EU budget.Many of them have so far neither signed nor ratified the Convention to protect financial interests, so that it was clear that radical more must be intervened.We have to take this responsibility seriously.We have to be able to proceed against people who commit fraud to the disadvantage of the European Union.The question arises as to who should do that.It gets really difficult here.Who is responsible in a body that includes numerous countries?We also have to take into account the interests of the Member States.The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor is extremely reasonable.It is clear to us all that a clearly federal approach and conditions under which a European judicial organ has priority to the respective national judicial organs, some of them go too far.But the discussion has to start, and we therefore ask the government conference to initiate it."	de
As for China, we should not let ourselves be dissuaded by lifting the question only because the discussions on the subject could be blocked.In any case, it is imperative that the union expresses itself and acts as a single entity, and the threats of commercial sanctions should strengthen instead of weakening our determination.However, if you want to give full expression to the decisions that can finally be made in Geneva, the office of the high commissioner for human rights will have to be equipped with the necessary resources.The United Nations financial resources are distributed insufficient and consequently many crucial programs, to remain operational, depend on voluntary contributions.Resources are also necessary to promote practical cooperation and human rights, strategic planning, the definition of priorities and the strengthening of communications between the community of donors and the United Nations Member States.To this end, the high commissioner has recently launched an annual appeal to collect 53 million dollars intended to allow his office to fulfill said tasks.The European Union and its Member States should take the guide by offering a significant share of these funds.In this way, not only would we embarrass the United States by pushing them to take on their responsibilities regarding the financing of the United Nations, but we would also show that our commitment towards the protection of human rights goes beyond simple and sterile rhetoric.Mr. President, this discussion focuses on the preparation of the annual session of the United Nations Commission for the rights of man, which will be held soon, and on the role in this context of the Commission and the Council.I was allowed first of all to express my great satisfaction for the statements made so far by Commissioner Patten and the Minister.I am also happy that today we also discuss both China and Cuba. Cuba remains the last example of dictatorship in Latin America, and this is an aspect that we must not forget, despite all the sympathy that that country enjoys here and there.Cuba is a dictatorship, it is therefore not a democracy.In the two minutes of word I have available I would like to dwell on two countries with which I have a particular bond.The first is Indonesia.It naturally makes us very pleasure that Indonesia now has a new government and that the positions of President and Vice -President are covered by Mr. Wahid and Mrs. Soekarnopoetri.We are also happy that the situation in Timor is slowly evolving in the right direction.However, I must inform you that in the Molucche Islands, which are located a little further north of Timor, violence still is the master, after in the last two years there have already been thousands of deaths.Tens of thousands of people are now on the run.The situation is out of control.Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow Dutch television will broadcast a large program to which observers have been asked to intervene for pure and simple purpose of observing what is happening to the Molucche, so that it can be recorded all what has really happened, also for the benefit of posterity or commissions for human rights.The urgent appeal that I want to launch now concerns a point that has been inserted many times in our resolutions, that is, the possibility of sending observers to the Molucche.	it
"In a country with little population like mine, Finland, going to Correos is a social event.In a world integrated into networks, mail service is the most democratic network, since it creates and maintains human relations.The common market in the postal sector will be carried out in accordance with the conditions of the market forces.For us, in the north, this means that the EU will destroy social infrastructure.Mr. Monti, the principle of competition does not fit in the field of human relations, and, therefore, we must develop postal services, and not end them.If we want everyone to have access to computer science and use it, the only way to guarantee this aspiration in society is through a public postal service.The postal service is democracy and can carry out these functions better than telecommunications companies.Within the framework of telecommunications, prices have risen due to the continuous sale of companies and that more than 50% of the business volume of these companies is intended for advertising.We have to make democratic investments to conserve democratic postal services.It is particularly convenient to be Mr. Monti who is responding to this debate, since the great dilemma that is raised with postal services is how to square an open market and a free and loyal competition, on the one hand, and the provision of a service that is universally available, even in the most remote and uninhabited region of the European Union.In the hills and valleys of Scotland, in the rural border area with England and the central belt, in the beautiful but fragile Howdent Islands, Orkney and Shetland, there is a real concern for the possible loss of this essential service.However, we all know that the quality of the service can only improve whether postal services, as well as all service activities, are given financial and management of the private sector and the acid of an open, even international competition.I will suggest a possible solution, which is already widely used in the transport sector.Air routes, ferry, train or bus that operate within the most remote areas and towards them are bidded.The bidder offering provides the specific service with a fixed quality level and with the lowest grade of subsidy takes the contract.Let's call it a ""negative bidding franchise.""This allows desirable competition to provide these services in accordance with a franchise system supported by public funds but totally transparent.Why couldn't the collection and postal shipping in a certain region be negative?The slightest subsidy would obtain the franchise for a certain period of time.Why could this type of negative tender be submitted to the post office of a section?It would correspond in that case to the democratically responsible, regional or national government body -probably under the general supervision of the EU -, establishing the criteria of the service and financial resources to meet this specific social objective.Otherwise, postal services can be subject to all market demands and impositions.Mr. President, commissioner, it is no accident that I am the fifth Scottish deputy of this assembly that takes the floor in this debate.This gives the measure of the importance of our postal services for us."	es
"So if one comes to the problems of the new knowledge -based economy, the new digital economy - which, as far as I know, has only produced unemployment instead of employment instead of employment - it is quite legitimate to ask whether the inability to deal with the current problems of unemployment, a largely phrase -rich explanation on the employment problems of the future ... nobody understands all of us, the internet, digital economy, the digital industry,And play the knowledge -based economy, but these were not the original goals of the employment summit.Mr. President, you closed with a slightly ideological tone, and that was a good thing.If the social democratic policy looks for the economy of the future, then I have to remind you that one of the most serious problems in relation to the internet-supported economy and the deficit of Europe is the lack of entrepreneurship that can be determined in the education system, in the actions of the governments and in the work of the institutions.And it has to proceed against this to guarantee the knowledge -based economy of the future.Mr. President!First of all, I would like to welcome you in the European Parliament, especially because with your visit you have already pointed out the symbolic, whereupon the chairman of the Group of the Social Democratic Party of Europe has already pointed out, that it is politically symbolic if you have also come to the capitals during your tour to hear the European Parliament.It is not for the first time that there is a different and politically invigorating relationship between council and parliament during the Portuguese presidency.However, as Comrade Barón Crespo has found, this is indeed a significant gesture, which we also like to take note of as such.Our attitude is clear: We support the initiative of the Portuguese government because it is serious and because we identify with the content, the strategic as well as the other goals.This is also very clear in the way this Council is prepared.On the one hand, the seriousness and thoroughness of the document presented in January.Then the individual preparatory conferences, the contribution that both entrepreneurs and trade unionists make for this summit.And above all, the latest contribution in the research area, which was made at the conference, on which Nobel Prize winners and Minister of Science and Technology came together.Here seriousness becomes visible, here an interest in the content of the summit preparation is visible.However, we also support the initiative in relation to the main goal already mentioned here, because it is not only the topic of employment and social issues for the first time again at the center of the European debate, but because it is again considered possible to ""achieve the goal of full employment"".For years, many said that this would be impossible that this would not be possible again in the new companies.I congratulate you, Mr. President, to put this topic back on the agenda without denying social cohesion and fundamental values ​​for us.These values ​​are not only the basis of the founding project of the European Union, but also the basis of our culture and, above all, our view of the extent of the solidarity required between all Europeans."	de
The lesson of experimentation in Europe teaches that it is right where the salary is weaker and the more flexible wage relationship that unemployment is higher while where the salary is higher and social relationships are better regulated the unemployment rate is more contained.Mr. President, this policy should arouse deep disappointment, certainly not hopes, in the hearts of European workers.With its resolution, our Commission shows that, in addition to the Commission, I recommend Ecofin and ECB, Parliament is also the proponent of an extremely neoliberal socio -economic policy, which has had many negative repercussions on the living and work conditions of employees and other large bands of population in the Member States.Our commission has firmly rejected any attempt by the speaker to give, in the motivation, a different dimension to the discussion on the economic situation in the European Union and to send certain messages to Commission and Council, different from that of Parliament, organ elected by the citizens of the Union.Even the positive contribution of international economic institutions and high -level experts, who contributed to reflection, received a miserable welcome.With this resolution, Parliament assumes serious responsibilities in the face of the citizens who have elected it, since it supports an extremely neoliberal socio -economic policy, which promotes generalized privatization, is said to be contrary to everything that is public, undermines workers' rights in the employment, wage, social and social security, imposes a rigid financial policy with strong anti -Popolar and anti -social connotations and,employers, asks workers to become more flexible if they want to find an employment.My group rejects a similar conception without appeal and therefore will not vote in favor of the resolution.Mr. President, the report presented by the Commission on the Union economy in 1999 seems to us nebula as it does not explain at all why our results remain desperately lower than the potential that the immense human resources of Europe should allow us to achieve.Of course, it is pleasant to note that the 3 -percent growth forecast for 2000, which could seem risky when the commission had formulated it in November 1999, today has serious possibilities to realize and this in the context of contained inflation, given that the peak of the 2 percent detected in January for the area of ​​the euro remains, however, lower than in the past.However, there is the impression that this growth, fueled first by the results of the United States, then by the increase in productivity of the new economy, as well as by new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general trend of the world, and this despite our disabilities.These handicaps, to which we must remedy with extreme urgency, we know them well;I am referring to the structural rigidity and excessive mandatory withdrawals that have always characterized us.However, let's not forget that, with the single currency, a new one has been added.In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the progressive alignment of the other policies impose further constraints of the Euro area, forcing them to behaviors that are not necessarily suitable for their structures and conjunctures.	it
I finish.I will not extend more: we will have the opportunity at other times.But, it goes without saying, as one of the speakers pointed out and I thank you all for your completely positive and relevant interventions, which we cannot allow ourselves to say again, in one, two or three years, that we have not done what we should.For my part, I can assure you, after having discussed it within the college of commissioners, that the Commission is willing to present in Parliament and to the Council the legislative measures, the modifications and the directives necessary to provide us with the highest security levels.The political will of this Parliament is necessary and I note that I can count on this will, as is that of the Council of Ministers.Thank you, Madam Commissioner.We have taken note of your availability.I have received 8 resolution proposals, filed on the basis of article 37, paragraph 2, of the regulation, to close this declaration of the commission.The debate is closed.The vote will take place Thursday at 12 noon.Storms in Europe The agenda calls for the declaration of the Commission on storms in Europe.The floor is to Mr. Barnier, on behalf of the Commission.Mr. Commissioner, I want to thank you for the words you have made, in particular for the completely concrete proposals concerning the victims who expect a lot from the European Union, from the aid that we can bring them.Personally, I sent you, in the first days which followed this terrible storm, a letter to ask you to request French authorities a readjustment of the perimeters of the objective 2, so that all the areas disaster by storms, both in France and elsewhere, can benefit from the objective 2. I think that it was done because you did not speak about it.We all know that if you are not in a perimeter of objective 2, you will have all the difficulties of the world in obtaining aid.So, it is better to remedy this problem right away.You also know that the problem is not just in the short term, but also in the medium and long term.I explain myself.I was present in Lorraine during this terrible storm which ravaged around 20 % of the Feuillus forest.Indeed, for certain so -called forest municipalities which are affected at 20 %, this represents an enormous loss.We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to mature.The loss that these municipalities will be undergone will therefore not spread over a year, two years, five years, but on much more.The municipalities concerned estimate that it will spread over 40 years.I therefore think that it will be really very difficult to compensate for losses in terms of financial return of these rural communities by subsidies.I believe that it is an aspect to engrave in our memories so as not to forget it in our different policies.	fr
If I could do my head, with a magic wand would harmonize excise duties throughout Europe, so the smuggling would no longer exist, except in cases where certain products are intrinsically more expensive in a given Member State.But I don't have a magic wand and I can't do my head.In this sector it takes unanimity, as the honorable Maccormick well knows, and if the Member States will not agree on the harmonization of excise duties, this will not be possible.I repeat that towards the end of the year the Commission will present a report on the situation of excise duties and obviously I am always available to discuss this relationship with Parliament.Community policy on water (continuation) The agenda bears the following of the discussion on the recommendation for the second reading on Community policy on water.Mr. President, the situation of fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world.However, the facts show that, if the demand for water has constantly increased, the quality of this resource is, on the contrary, decreased.To this should be added the problems relating to water pollution in the potential new Member States of Eastern Europe, as well as the recent rupture, in Romania, of a decanting basin containing cyanide, a disaster that could now involve the water pipes that supply the Iugoslav population.I understood that the commissioner Mrs. Wallström, whom I thank for being present tonight, will visit the area.I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of Parliament can refuse to recognize that this directive is essential to end the current fragmentation of water policy, as well as to facilitate the start of a program that provides specific measures for each hydrographic basin.The processing was difficult and complex, multiple interests and divergent opinions.There is no doubt that the honorable Lienemann, rapporteur in this legislature, has made great efforts and commitment to try to reconcile and reconcile the positions, reaching its objective to a large extent.However, it is almost impossible to know and evaluate all situations and expectations equally.I come from a country whose southern half overlooks the Mediterranean, a country in which the availability of water has always been linked to the whims of a fickle climatology and a complex conformation of the soil.Century after century, year after year, day after day, until today, the Mediterranean region has had to fight against this adversity in order to develop.This is why it seems very important to us that this directive reaffirms the obligation sanctioned in article 164 of the treaty which requires the community legislation to take into account the diversity of its regions.In order to see this principle applied, the Spanish delegation of the European People's Party will oppose the amendments nos.4 - considering 21 -, 13 and 49 - article 11, paragraph d) -, which seriously limit the sphere of exclusive competence of the Member States, as in the case of the regulation of water resources.For the community it would be very difficult to determine the conditions of this regulation in the various regions, given the different internal balances always present, balances that require, in any case, a profound knowledge of the different areas and interests in play.	it
Incidentally, in this situation, the political of the European Union has a high level of responsibility.Of course we have to adjust these systems.Especially in France, one has to stop taking up the financing of health insurance and pensions to the labor market alone.Furthermore, the archaic administration mode must be reformed, which represents a source of injustices, mismanagement and waste.In particular, we have to pursue family policy geared towards demographic growth, a economic, monetary and tax policy aimed at growth and reconquest of our internal market, which contributes to the creation of jobs.The commission's proposals and the report Andersson have nothing to do with social policy, but they are an instrument that gives Brussels excessive decision -making powers regarding financing, i.e. the organization and services of the social protection systems of the European nations.For this reason, we voted against this text.Social protection must primarily be an expression of national solidarity, and it is primarily and exclusively the responsibility of the nation states.Social protection must be based on the principle of national and common preference.Otherwise, he only serves the financial regulation of unbearable social conditions that represent a consequence of immigration, at the expense and to the damage of European citizens.We did not participate in the vote on the report by Jan Andersson on a concerted strategy for modernizing social protection.Our basic attitude to the European Union is positive.As Swedish liberals, we consider European integration as a possibility of solving cross -border problems, such as:B. questions of the environment, trade, international mobility, human rights and conflict resolution.Here the democracies of Europe in the world can show that cooperation leads to peace and prosperity.But we also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, i.e.h.that the decision must be taken as close to the person concerned as possible.For this reason, we actively work for a constitution of the European Union, from which the distribution of responsibilities is clearly visible to everyone.It must be absolutely clear to all citizens of the Union that the EU deals exclusively with the questions that it can best solve it - the cross -border problems.All other matters should be treated at local, regional or national level.Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU should only have a limited responsibility, except in cases that deal with the free mobility of people within the Union.Each Member State should have full responsibility and the right to self -determination for its social protection systems.Healthcare, childcare and geriatric care are clear examples of areas that are not directly borders.The same applies to employment policy.We do not consider a common European legal rules in these areas to solve the problems of the social security systems.It is important for us that the Union focuses on a few questions that can really be achieved.However, this does not prevent the Member States from working together and exchanging ideas in the social field.Social security and equality are traditionally high on the agenda of the liberals.That is why we can follow many of the proposals raised in the Anderson report at the national level without reservation.	de
Mr. Barnier, I beg you to apologize, but I have not fully answered the last part of my question about the great energy transport networks.Could you give an answer to that regard?Do you worry about your honor to know if the installation of nuclear centrals somewhere is going to be financed charged to structural funds?I am schematizing.We could say that there is no need to think about that.I have told him, honor, that, in accordance with the regulations of the structural funds, the selection of the projects remains the competence of the Member States.Therefore, the commission services are not systematically informed of all selected projects.However, his honor does well to ask me, it is his job and mine is to answer him.As has already happened in the past, Member States are forced to respond, to the extent that the commission interrogates or asks for details.Thus, I will go a little further than the confidence usually shared between the Member States and the Commission and I will see exactly what it is, in the specific case mentioned by the honor.The Member State or the interested member states must then respond and I will transmit their response to their honor, when you receive it.I seemed to have answered the question of the great networks.The energy situation is extraordinarily variable according to the regions of the European Union and the help of the funds, in certain cases and regions, it could be justified, in particular in case the connection to the basic energy networks is still underdeveloped.This is the answer I can give about that link between large energy transport networks and structural funds.- Question No. 46 Formulated by (H-0052/00): Subject: Structural funds and additional to the light of the attentive response given by the Commission recently to my written written question on structural funds and additional, could the commission indicate if you plan to modify in any way the norms related to additional?Would it be in favor, in particular, of modifying the norms in such a way that additional not only apply at the level of the Member States but also within them, in regard to the budgetary provisions between the central governments and the regions or countries with a statute of internal autonomy?I would like to respond to Mr. MacCormick that the Commission has not planned to modify the regulations related to additional, which, for the period 2000-2006, was in article 11 of the General Regulations of the Funds.As in the past, the principle of additional is applied, according to such regulations, to the relationship between structural funds and the whole - I say well: the set -of expenses of the Member State in Development.In that regard, it should be stressed that the expenses financed by the structural funds are those that must be additional.It is not mandatory that the co -financing provided by the Member State is, that is, that it is added to its expenses.While the Member State does not reduce the set of its own expenses, it can be considered, and we consider that the structural funds add up to national expenses and, therefore, the principle of additionality is respected.Regarding the budgetary provisions applicable in the Member States, between the central government and the regions or the countries that enjoy internal autonomy, they are determined by virtue of exclusively national considerations, so they are not affected by additional, in the sense formulated in the regulations.	es
So if you want to give any lessons, they are in good hands in this high house.She knows me well enough to know that in all phases of our five -year collaboration in this house there was not once that I would not have provided information about everything I did, comprehensive, officially and detailed.Mr President, allow me first, the careful and, as I came up, sacrificing work by Mr. van Hulten to prepare for this report.Although he has not belonged to this house for long, he is already an old hare in many ways, as a former civil servant in his familiarity with the institutions, and I think that this preference is demonstrated by his ability to tackle this difficult topic that - as several MPs have carried out - is of crucial importance for all of our institutions.I thank him and wish him a long and successful MP ​​career.As you know, the Van Hulten report had to be very long for the second report of the committee of independent experts, and since I would like to give this a comprehensive answer, especially in connection with the problem of financial management and control, I would like to ask you now.Of course, I will not take the time of the MPs longer than absolutely necessary.When the second report of the committee of independent experts was discussed in front of this high house last September, on behalf of the new Commission, I assured that the report would serve as an essential template for the proposals for reforming the Commission.The high house will recognize what efforts we take to complete implement this assurance as soon as it deals with the reform package, which is now quite well in the demanding schedule that we had said goodbye to the demanding schedule.I am sure that Mr. Pomez Ruiz finds that encouraging.The vast majority of the proposals contained in the paper are very similar to those of Mr. Van Hulten, and contains this paper - I and Mr. Staes - to say that an extremely exact schedule for the actions to be carried out in the course of the reform.For this reason, the report that I had the honor has no unexplained or ambivalent positions.The opinion of this parliament will be of great importance in the coming four to five-week consultation period for obvious reasons.I would like to reply Mr. Elles that we are definitely in reception mode.However, he will certainly recognize with the usual generosity that the prerequisite for the fact that we can at all accept a reaction to our suggestions must first send our suggestions.Hence the transmission.Due to time constraints, it is not possible for me to discuss all the components of the decision -making application in front of the Hohen house, but I would be happy to assure you that the details are treated as an important training for our reform proposals throughout the advisory period and of course for our work in other important areas.I now turn to the most important topics of the motion for resolution and would like to attach the following comments.	de
"So we will create a cooperative climate that has a positive effect on the quality of the reform.The representatives of the parliament at the government conference have to make it clear to the negotiating partners that we also take responsibility for their constitutional development with the institutional changes in the Union.You should therefore be aware that such questions can not only be decided by haggling.The topics of this government conference are extremely delicate.It may be easy to formulate solutions, but the question is to what extent these solutions can withstand history.I refer to two possible points of conflict.On the one hand, we have the previously preserved balance between large and small countries.Europe is not a classic federal state and can not become anyone.The solutions we have to be decided must submit to the basic concept of the European Union, which is a Union of the states and a Union of the peoples.The other field on which tensions can arise is even more complicated.In view of the upcoming admission of new members, we are calling for more efficient working organs from the future European Union.This means that you have to work easier and faster.However, the European Union is and remains a complex and complicated multi -state institution per se.There are certainly options for tightening and simplification, but there are also limits here.If we overthrow the goal in favor of one -sided efficiency, then the legitimation of the European Union is questioned.However, I am confident.Mr. President, the mandate of the government conference must be expanded.The most important question that needs to be added is the inner differentiation of the Union.Unfortunately, the European Parliament has not yet dealt with it at all, but this is necessary so that the Union can be expanded in the agreed manner.Former Commission President Jacques Delors has again publicly brought up the idea of ​​the European Confederation and also referred to the fact that the avant-garde countries at the top of the association should progress faster than others and that they should establish clarity for their own institutions.The current Commission President Prodi and the High Representative Solana have commented in a similar way.The faction of the liberal and democratic party of Europe positioned itself in the statement on internal differentiation that was assumed last November and proposed a system of concentric circles for Europe, the ""onion model"".In the next decision to the government conference, the parliament should really deal closely with the question of differentiation and flexibility.If we do not succeed in creating the system proposed by the liberal faction, both the expansion and integration are at stake.My colleagues, Ms. Frassoni and Mr. Onesta have already expressed a little skeptical about some aspects of the topic that we are currently advising.I would like to add a word of concern about the question of subsidiarity not only between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Member States and their own autonomous regions.So far, this has not been duly taken into account, although there are many things to worry here.I would particularly like to deal with one of the effects of the expansion in relation to this parliament.The upper limit was determined that this parliament may include a maximum of 700 MPs so that it can continue to do justice to the role of the role of an advisory meeting."	de
Thank you, Mr. Medina Ortega.I completely share the regrets you express.Would you have the kindness to write to me so that I can, proof to support, seize the competent authorities both of Air France and also of the French government?I believe that, really, it is no longer possible and it is absolutely necessary that we protest in the most energetic way.Madam President, I had the same experience yesterday as Mr. Medina Ortega.I think that the French authorities - who have the honor of welcoming the headquarters of the European Parliament to Strasbourg - must become aware of their responsibility to guarantee adequate links with all the Union capitals.Absolutely, Mr. Napolitano, thank you.Madam President, this is not a question here of aircraft delays: I would like to excuse the absence yesterday of my colleague from the Green Group, Caroline Lucas, who is British deputy.She could not be present, because she was arrested during an anti -nuclear demonstration in Glasgow yesterday morning.Her identity was noted: it appeared very clearly that she is a European deputy, it was nevertheless kept in detention all day.I believe that it is absolutely unacceptable and I will ask you - I also wrote to you with my colleague Ms. Hautala on this subject - to intervene with the British authorities so that such facts are no longer represented and so that excuses are presented to Ms. Lucas.Thank you, Mr. Lannoye.I have received your letter and I have already intervened with the British performance.Madam President, with regard to today's vote, I would like to ask for something that I have already addressed yesterday, during the oral debate on the Equal report.I request a postponement of the vote on the Equal initiative, because we simply still need a little time to settle an important point.I am optimistic and I really plan to vote with serenity and confidence;We will find such a wide agreement as possible for this position on Equal.We only need a little time to settle the details on the question of asylum and I therefore ask to vote tomorrow rather than today.Madam President, to follow up on the point raised by Mr. Lannoye: Mrs. Lucas was arrested outside Glasgow for demonstrating against the trident base located in Faslane.I have a lot of sympathy for this event.However, I do not have any sympathy for the fact that Mrs. Lucas tries to hide behind her parliamentary immunity.For my part, I was also arrested for demonstrating in Faslane.I did not entrenched myself behind my immunity.I accepted the sanction that was applied to me.Ms. Lucas should do the same.Madam President, I would like to come back to Ms. Stenzel's request to postpone the vote on the Equal Community initiative tomorrow.Indeed, this initiative has been the subject of a fairly animated discussion within the Commission and, since it is an important proposal from the Commission which relates to the agreements arrested last year, I think it is acceptable.We join Ms. Stenzel on the fact that the request for dismissal is justified in order to find the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that the Parliament expresses the widest possible majority, her position on this initiative.	fr
During last fall already, we heard Mr. Bernard Kouchner claim police forces.I am satisfied to hear that Mr. Javier Solana will bring together the interior ministers next weekend to discuss the question of police action.I hope that this discussion will first focus on Kosovo, so that we can offer a remedy for this desperate situation.Still with regard to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will follow up on the wish expressed by the Parliament - and if I am not mistaken, also by the Commission - to see defined over several years a budget devoted to action in Kosovo.Mr. Solana, the events of Kosovo have brought us several lessons: we have learned, for example, the need, to deal with crises, to endow a military capacity that we have already used concretely.But it is advisable to learn another just as important lesson: namely that it is better to prevent crises, rather than being forced to intervene afterwards.The EU therefore also needs an independent and credible capacity in terms of conflict prevention.With regard to the Commission, Commissioner Patten has already taken several laudable initiatives in this direction.I am thinking of the proposal which would consist in setting up a rapid reaction FACILITY and a RAPID REACTION Force for non -military actions, as well as to create goals headlines for non -military actions and a CRISIS Center commission.The last question I would like to send to Mr. Javier Solana is the following: what concrete preparatory work has been carried out in this area of ​​conflict prevention?How were they organized in Mr. Solana's service, and how were they coordinated with the work of the Commission?Mr. President, Mr. Solana, you have the whole support and confidence of the Liberal group, but we want to remind you of the huge responsibility that now rests on your shoulders.Among other things, I think of humanitarian operations, recovery and peacekeeping.But I also think of responsibility, ² which is now yours, to ensure that the new European cooperation in defense does not create the slightest division between NATO and the EU, nor between the USA and Europe.Such a division would only rejoice the despots and rebel states that threaten freedom and human rights.You have, I think, heard the concerns expressed last week in front of our parliament by some members of the US Congress.You must ward off these concerns, Mr. Solana because, as you said yourself, if we are united on both sides of the Atlantic, we can do something.If we divide, we weaken ourselves and thus lengthen the sufferings of the oppressed.From then on, Mr. Solana, maintain the narrowest contacts with our American allies, without forgetting Norway, Turkey and Canada.It is also to a large extent thanks to them that we will not become paper tigers.We have, Mr. George Robertson often said, two million soldiers, but we couldn't even align 40,000 in Kosovo.It is perhaps our weakness and our lack of credibility that led to war.	fr
But they distrust that the shot does not come out with respect to the workers and the unemployed, to whom it is repeated that everything is getting better and better, when they prove that their life does not improve, but, on the contrary, it worsens.This is the main ideological struggle for Europe that is presented to us.I think this debate summarizes it perfectly.The main political division has been evident tonight and it is no surprise that this issue has polarized the debate in an assembly that is known for its consensus capacity and distinctive policy, and I am pleased that this difference of opinion can be seen so clearly, because it is in this case a radical report.This report is a call to Europe to wake up.This report recommends radical measures that basically make personnel hiring easier.That simple.The reason why in Europe we have such exorbitant unemployment rates is because in many cases it is too complicated to hire personnel due to procedures and regulation and lack of flexibility of labor markets.It is the only way we can advance, because the authentic way of guaranteeing social justice in Europe - and after all is for what we are here - goes through the creation of prosperity and opportunities and jobs.This report clarifies clearly towards the most effective way to do so, because Europe has to wake up.You cannot create jobs only through public spending.You cannot create jobs through legislation to reduce working hours, as if jobs were a cake that is chopped and distributed among people.The real world simply does not work that way.And if Europe wants to be left behind, to be left behind in stagnation and unemployment and in statism and in corporatism, then, vote tomorrow against this report.But if they want Europe to advance and begin to respond to the population of Europe, then I would like to ask everyone to support this report, because it will provide those jobs and provide those opportunities and because it is the only means of getting it.Mr. President, Ladies, the Giorgos Katiforis report, in its original version, had the great value of extracting from the specific observations of the commission's document on the situation of the economy in Europe, strong indications for a European Union strategy capable of giving continuity and stability to the perspectives of sustainable development that arise in 2000 for all the countries of our continent.These indications referred to the need for an effective coordination of the economic policies of the Union, to overcome the separate management of economic policies and social policies that until now has represented a serious obstacle to the definition of a coherent strategy to fight unemployment, with a view to full employment.Different Mr. Von Wogau, it is this governance emptiness of the European economy that determines, at least in part, the weakening of the euro.The indications of the document also referred to the creation of a European Research and Promotion Area, in all states of the Union, of converging measures in research, permanent training and occupation, exceeding all forms of unfair competence between the states in fiscal matters.	es
Obviously the relationship with Armenia constitutes an element of these relationships with the outside, as proof of the agreement signed last year.We believe that Turkey, if she wants to get to share the fundamental values ​​of the European Union and the general framework of its relationships - regardless of the bilateral idiosyncrasies that can have towards another country - in general terms it will have to behave according to the basic models adopted by the European Union in its external relations.Moreover, we are sure that the question in question will constitute one of the priorities in bilateral relations between the European Union and Türkiye in the near future.Question n.6 of the honorable (H-0122/00): object: ethnic cleaning of Serbs in Kosovo from the end of the bombings against Iugoslavia by NATO and EU intended to prevent the ethnic cleaning of Kosovar Albanians by Serbia, and from the arrival of KFfor, on June 12, 1999, 200,000 serbs residing in Kosovo were expulsion and 768 were assassinated, with the 768,Result that an ethnic cleaning of Serbs has been recorded comparatively higher than that occurred by the Serbs themselves.In the last few days we have witnessed the assassination, as always unpunished, of Serbs by Mafie Kosco-Albanians.What decision does the advice intend to end to put an end, once and for all, to this ethnic cleaning and to guarantee respect for human rights to the whole population of Kosovo, regardless of the breed or creed?I would like to thank the president in office for the council for the response provided, but I would also like to remember that, statistically, in Kosovo there is more violence now than there was before the Bombardments NATO.It is worrying that the bombings aggravated the situation, and it should be recognized that NATO and the European Union have committed a mistake by making that decision.The president in charge of the Council spoke rightly - there is no doubt - of the faults of Belgrade, but it must also be remembered that the secret services of the USA, Germany, France, Italy, Great Britain have continued to provide weapons and money to the UK, to a mafia, therefore, to help create problems in the area.Therefore, we all have our faults.I would like to ask a complementary question about the global context.Do you think that it would be appropriate to remove the embargo from Serbia to return the area greater economic normality and allow Kosovo, as a province of Serbia, can benefit from it?Mr President, I am not a friend of Milosevic or his government.However, I have very serious doubts about the legitimacy of NATO action against Yugoslavia regarding Kosovo, both for the lack of authority of the United Nations Security Council, and because it would have been possible not to avoid by imposing unacceptable terms with Ramobouillet regarding the sovereignty of Serbia.The current situation in Kosovo, where the ethnic cleaning of Serbs and Roma has now been completed, is commented on to itself.NATO should not at least recognize the mistake of deliberately hit the Tower of the television of Belgrade and that of killing 20 civil journalists, these made these who remain a serious moral stain on war management and now open the embarrassing prospect of a possible incrimination for war crimes against western leaders?	it
This will lead us to make the citizens' program of culture 2000.This participation increased by our citizens, who hopes strongly, will have to be wide and fruitful as much as possible.For my part, I am committed to operating so that, over the five years in which the program will be divided, this participation becomes a tangible reality.I know that you parliamentarians, in your regions, in your countries, worked with the participants in the program so that all these small flowers, as a colleague said, become a vast multicolored carpet.I would like this program to become a tangible reality and that culture represented for us citizens not only a factor of enrichment, both on a personal and socio -economic level, but also a right that will have to be affirmed and the sign of an agreement found within the union.Here is the contribution of our European Culture 2000 program. It is not a competition for culture policies carried out in the various Member States, which are necessary and I would like to see them even more developed.It is simply a complementary addition, a bridge between the different cultures of our different countries.Expand and enrich the participation of European citizens in culture therefore seems to me to be an essential task that justifies our efforts.We must measure the success of our action and that of our union with the metro of culture.Many parliamentarians have argued very appropriately that, if a union is made only of economic elements, it was born dead, but if it is made of culture, civilization and participation, then it can live.This is the basis, honorable deputies, that I intend to develop, taking into account in particular the following five lines: to offer opportunities of an innovative nature to our creatives so that their talent finds in our program the support they deserve;Encourage exchanges, mobility, formations, in the cultural sector;encourage cooperations between cultural operators;expand the public giving in particular great space to young people;Finally, safeguard and make the common heritage of European importance as well as the history of European peoples know better.I am sure that the new program, thanks to its structure and its organization based on transparency, efficiency and balance, will be a competitive and irreplaceable tool in the service of our action.Mrs. President, I thank Parliament for your support and for once again demonstrated the importance that attributes to culture in the context of the Union.I am sure that he will not be disappointed for having granted us his support and I am committed to personally inform him of the various phases of implementation of our action, of the action of our citizens, who I hope will be significant for the future of the Union.Thanks, lady commissioner.I believe that our rapporteur can be thanking once again.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, at 11.00.(The session ends at 9.55 pm) Out of use, the agenda bears the recommendation for the second reading (A5-0006/2000), of the Environment Commission, public health and consumer policy, on the common position of the Council in view of the adoption of the European Parliament directive and the Council relating to out of use vehicles [8095/1/1999 -C5-0180/1999 -1997/0194 (cod)] (speaker: honorable Florenz).	it
During the budget procedure, we were told that the funds for Kosovo would have to be approved quickly, and now it is the case that no tenders have so far been published or carried out.This is serious, because this delays the entire process of reconstruction in Kosovo.Finally, and that is the logical conclusion of my explanations, we ask the Commission to inform the budget committee regularly, monthly, about the statement of execution of the expenses.We have documents in which there is talk of fixed middle bonds.We do not need fixed middle bonds, we simply need medium -sized bonds, and we have to know what has actually been paid and, above all, what has not been paid.The Kosovo suffered enough from paying delays.President!When we talk about Kosovo today, which we have done many times, we should also take account of what has already been done in Kosovo or whether something has already been done.I mean, there are already a few small steps on the way to normal, and you would like to list them at least once as part of such a debate.From February 9th there will be a so -called interim council - he is called Kosovo Transitional Council - in which both the political parties, both the minorities and the Civil Society are represented and which should be an interim parliament.This is good, we welcome that, but I think you also have to give them an instrument and a strategy planning for what they should actually prepare, because elections are planned in autumn.Nobody really knows what these elections should lead to what a parliament should become of it.Nobody knows what powers of this parliament should have compared to the Unmik.This means that these are a lot of imponderables that we are not informed about and the other probably cannot classify correctly.Exactly the Albanians who are now integrated in this interim country, should actually have a little more idea of ​​what awaits them.In addition to the economic work, in addition to reconstruction, it must also be remembered to produce the coexistence of the Serbs, the Albanians and other minorities - including the Roma - in this country so that the way of coexistence can hopefully be reconciliation at some point.I want to list again what actual things already exist that we can look forward to.There are now 34 tax inspectors in the area of ​​administration.This is something great!People are now encouraged to pay their taxes there too, because in the long run it cannot be the case that everyone only depends on the sack of the EU and other donors;A bit must also come from your own possibilities in this area.It must also be determined that 4 of the 19 departments already have 4 administrative lines, which is also progress for what we have had there so far.We also have something that is very important for the rule of law that we want to build.We have 130 judges and prosecutors who are now sworn in who can take on their work in order to speak right there in order to also enrich the culture of tolerance there and of course also to be able to track down the crimes and then also be able to express convictions.	de
I wonder however why you can't talk about public health.It is an important part of social protection that is submerged in a kind of crisis - which also costs a lot of money and is important for a lot of people - and of which the Council is evidently not going to speak.Then Mr. Barón has worried me a bit because he has said that the program you present, president, is in the background a social democratic program.Then I have reflected something more about his intervention and, indeed, I think there is an issue in it that was clearly social democrat.It is the point where you want to design macroeconomics in such a way that employment is created.If a good macroeconomic policy is made, it is obvious that it automatically leads to a greater growth of employment.We have already seen that.But on the other hand, you cannot abuse the healthy macroeconomy rules specifying them too much.Then we would come to a situation that many economies governed by the social economy or social democracy have still known or know, whose victim in the end is employment, by a wrong macroeconomic policy.This should not happen.Therefore, I hope that the prime minister does not propose to cancel the macroeconomic policy that we have followed in recent years and that he has reported much success, or change it in such a way that it is no longer effective.As an end point, Mr. President, I have a problem with the documents of the Portuguese Presidency and somehow, although to a lesser extent, with those of the Commission and is their defensive nature.There are some countries in Europe, including Denmark, also the Netherlands or Ireland, which in the field of employment have performed an equally good action as the United States.That is, it is possible for Europeans to match the US.There are other countries that have not been less capable.Then it is much more prudent to be investigated because some countries do so badly, why some regions perform such a lousy action instead of saying that we all do it much worse than the United States.It seems to me that this in general terms is not completely true, even less if we take into account that the internal market only has been operating since January 1, 1993. And it is a relatively short time.Mr. President, Prime Minister Guterres has been convincing.The presidency's proposals contrast with the usual community jargon.European citizens do not want a theological debate, they expect concrete actions.According to Professor Fitousi, the greatest deficit that European society is currently threatened is the deficit of Porvenir.Many of our fellow citizens fear a future that has been painted in black for two decades.The slightest accident is presented as an irreversible ecological catastrophe.Science is often demonized.Result: Young people orient less and less towards scientific studies.People are asked to be flexible, to participate in the unbridled race to productivity.	es
Human rights should not be limited to a tight reading only at the time of complaint or punishment.As Parliament, we must face the issue of human rights, especially from the point of view of prevention.In this sense, we must be able to export a culture of legality, a culture of law, a convenience of law.I think it has definitely completed a long stage in which the treaties and treaties of the treaties were piled up.Today we have many, perhaps too many treaties that refer to the issue of human rights: if these treaties are reduced to mere enunciation, they are only examples of useless thought.Today we have to move on to a subsequent and necessary stage that is that of the daily and mandatory application of what is written in our treaties, although we must not forget that some fundamental treaties still have to be incorporated.I refer to the Conference of Rome and that 14 of 15 states of the Union have not yet ratified the treaty related to the International Criminal Court.I think we must review and modify some political instruments through which we measure the quality of the planet's human rights.We have often used instruments that, from the formal point of view, can be comfortable but, from the point of view of the political result, are absolutely useless.I refer to use, and often to abuse, which has been made of the embargo throughout these years and the application too prudent of the suspension clause of the agreements between the European Union and the third countries, in the event that human rights are violated in said countries.I think we must update the Human Rights Protection horizon.Globalization is exposed to the risk of especially punitive reading.At this time, in many countries the principle of human rights universality is questioned.It is considered that many human rights and the right to life, denied with the death penalty, are dependent variables, while globalization, frequently understood in a punitive sense, runs the risk of being, in fact, the only network that maintains together the rights, actions and policies of all countries.Consequently, we have to update our field of action within the scope of this effort oriented to protection human rights.I think of social rights, workers' rights, in the quality of work, in the need to pretend respect for all the criteria that have been indicated, as it should be, by the World Labor Organization.I think of the right to tolerance, the right to respect that is a right of all minorities, especially within the European Union.I also refer to the right to development that is a right of peoples that are in turn a sum of individuals: every individual, within the people to which it belongs, is entitled to a development, to a future that is first and foremost a place of hope and growth.I estimate that all this is part of a reasoning, a debate and a contribution that the European Union must lead to the field of human rights.	es
The Commission cannot instead accept the amendments nos.1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 81 (rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107. I thank you for attention.(Parliament declares the common position thus modified) report (A5-0033/2000) of the Honorable Andersson on behalf of the Commission for employment and social affairs, on the communication of the Commission relating to a concerted strategy to modernize social protection (com (1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182 (COS)) (the Parliament approves the resolution).With this the votes are concluded.Voting declarations- Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000) I please myself with the quality and ambition of the report relating to Life.I would like to remember in short that Life is a financial instrument at the service of the policies on the environment in the European Union and in third countries, whether they are neighboring Mediterranean countries, coastal countries of the Baltic Sea or countries candidate for accession.The Commission for the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has proposed several amendments, most of which was taken into consideration in the common position adopted by the Council.For the third phase of Life (2000-2004), this tool will divide into three axes called Life-Natura (47 percent of resources), life-environment (47 percent) and Life-Paesi third (6 percent).The most important changes concern in my opinion: Life's contribution to sustainable development in the community and promotion of community policy in the environment sector, in particular as regards the integration of the environmental dimension in other policies, and the contribution to the implementation and updating of legislation on the environment;the improvement of effectiveness, transparency and methodology of the implementation procedures of Life, information and dissemination procedures with the public and those of cooperation between the beneficiaries;The goal of Life, which must consist mainly in sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out in the framework of the Urban initiative, on which I also had an opportunity to express myself;The contribution of the projects aimed at promoting the sustainability of socio -economic activities, and consequently the creation of jobs.What seems essential to me is the fact that the Life tool will remain open to the participation of the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe.The other candidate countries (for example, Cyprus, Türkiye, Malta) will also be able to participate in Life when agreements will be concluded with them.The main rock in the negotiations with the Council is the level of the financial endowment scheduled for the third phase of the Life program (2000-2004).The Commission proposal approved by the Board is 613 million euros, while the Environment Commission believes that the amount should be equal to 850 million euros.I support the firmness of the rapporteur.From the creation of the program, in fact, the financial endowment has never been adequate, even on the occasion of the transition to fifteen Member States following the expansion of the European Community.If the report is adopted in plenary session, a conciliation procedure must be started, as required by the codecision procedure, to resolve the question of the amount of the allocations provided for the program.	it
"At the beginning of the decade, we must predict the way in which our institutions will develop on an international level until the end of this same decade, and in particular what place we should occupy within the international monetary bodies, what place we should occupy within the United Nations organizations and so on.We have to open this debate.In conclusion, this morning, the day following Valentine's Day, the newspapers announce that your honeymoon is over.I don't know if you are romantic or not, Monsieur Prodi.Perhaps it is a very little romantic point for such a day.However, we congratulate ourselves within the group of liberals because we believe that it means, now, we have seriously set to work.It is in the order of things.Considering the many adjectival descriptions that you used with regard to Europe during your speech - an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe which has a human face and which is inclusive - allow me to define, in a word dear to the curled of my liberal colleagues, in two words, Europe that we want to see itself in your governance plan: a Europe of possible.Madam President, Mr. Chairman of the Commission, I have a lot of esteem for your franchise when you admit that the European Union must change at all.You think about major questions in principle in your program.I believe that citizens will start to be more interested in politics if we are able to raise big questions in addition to the daily small things.At the same time, it must be noted that your program unfortunately resembles in many reports to a party program.It indeed contains many good intentions, but the concrete proposals on the ways of making all this are largely lacking.Like any party program, it also contains several internal contradictions.By my intervention, I would like to help you detect these internal contradictions.First of all, economics and social development.You have to be able to think about how to reconcile the objective of competitiveness with the objective of full employment;This is therefore mentioned in your program.Should we finally predict a convergence criterion which - as you actually suggest in this program - would aim that in any Member State, unemployment will exceed, say the rate of the three countries that have best succeeded in this area?The ecological tax reform is what my group wants to underline.We cannot indeed create jobs and sustainable development by modifying the structure of taxation, but it is unfortunately - as we all know - of an area in which the European Union is quite unable to act.Please raise this question during the intergovernmental conference.The European Union can obtain its legitimacy only by focusing on the tasks that isolated countries cannot assume alone.Parliament surely defends with you the importance of supranational decision -making in this direction.An internal contradiction in your report is linked to globalization.I find that you have a lot of merit of raising the concept of ""global mastery"", as other people here have noted."	fr
I hope and trust that you, Monti Commissioner, support these proposals and wait for your comments and your position in this regard.Finally, I want to welcome the report on the competence of the XXVIII DG of the Commission, which once again has dedicated a considerable amount of work.However, as I have already mentioned, our last purpose must continue to be transparency and clarity.It is still necessary to improve the effectiveness in the aforementioned areas, and therefore there are sufficient reasons to continue working with an eye to solve the problems related to the lack of transparency and clarity in the field of state aids.Above all, it is necessary in relation to the next extension and I would like to express my thanks to Mr. Jonckheer, who has dealt with his report very conscientiously all the problems related to expansion and how to ensure that these countries meet our requirements and also that we compete on equal terms.It is evident that as liberals and green we have different conceptions of the world, however, in our objectives we are largely agreeing and we will try to find a reasonable solution to our problems.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, we must simply answer two questions.Are state aid to companies legitimate or are the agreements between companies in a market economy legitimate, and who should control these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy?Regarding the first point, we openly affirm that, in order to take into consideration the needs of sustainable development that the European Union signs, it is essential that in certain cases there are state aid to companies, either in the form of fiscal relief, of a fiscal regime differentiated or simply from direct aid.It is equally legitimate that there are agreements between companies, self -limitation agreements, all those agreements that allow to alleviate the harmful effects of competition on social needs or ecological needs.Therefore, we respond clearly yes: it is legitimate that there may be aid, that there are agreements, but we affirm that each of these agreements must be expressly subject to an argument.The Von Wogau report proposes to return control of this legitimacy nationwide.That seems relatively dangerous, but however we will give our favorable vote, because we recognize that the commission cannot do everything.We demand that the greatest transparency be applied and that the commission is granted a greater investigation power to verify after the legitimacy of these exceptions.Mr. President, once again we discuss the competence policy of the European Union.Under what conditions, however, this debate really develops and what conclusions should we arrive?What characterizes the current reality is the materialization of gigantic absorptions, mergers and purchases of huge monopoly companies and the formation of tremendously powerful groups of planetary.Frankly, should our debate to this situation take care of?What competition policy do you want and can establish controls to the performance of these monopoly companies?	es
We change the right so that it can be executed again;I don't find that acceptable.The Commission gives up its exemption monopoly.Against the background of this planned system of legal exception, competitive restrictions are easily released, provided that the requirements of Article 81 (3) EGV are met.There is no need for registrations in Brussels, which means that the commission will be on blind flight in the future in the future.I don't think this is acceptable.The concept of the Commission is supplemented by increased subsequent subsequent control of the national authorities and the courts of the Member States.Here, however, if this takes place as part of a renationalization, we will come to a competitive patchwork in Europe.I think this is not acceptable.A core of European politics is weakened here.The system change in European antitrust law, which is caught by the European Commission, is highly risky.We have enough other options in the existing system to secure open markets and free competition.Incidentally, the commission comes back to old suggestions with its proposal, which have already been submitted in the 1950s and 1960s.At that time there was no majority.Because France put the legal exception very much at the time at the time, it was compensated by concessions in agricultural policy.This proposal is now on the table forty years later, and - I am sure - it will create scope for antitrust formations at the expense of consumers in Europe.I don't think this is acceptable!Mr President, values ​​of colleagues, in this important pronunciation on competitive policy, I would like to say something this morning, especially on the report of Mr. Langen regarding the steel aid code.As the European Court of Justice recognized in 1996, the iron and steel industry is particularly susceptible to disorders of the competition.Incidentally, I came to this conclusion a few years ago in a report on the strengths and weaknesses of the European iron and steel industry.Therefore, it was quite legitimate to introduce a aid system for this sector, with the help of which the survival of powerful companies is to be guaranteed, even if there is an objection to Article 4 of the EC Treaty.This is exactly the concern of the sixth steel aid code.At the same time, however, it is important to avoid any violation of the competition regulations and any serious disorders of balance in the markets, and therefore these aid must be regulated.The state aid will continue to be limited to research, development, environmental protection and closure aids.In the same sense, it is primarily important that the Member States meet their duty to take account of the aid that they have granted their iron and steel companies before the Commission.The Commission suggests shortening the deadlines and I agree to this claim.Just like the rapporteur, I welcome the Commission's report, but regret that not all aspects of steel allowance are treated.Although the steel aid code is very clear, the Commission has approved aid to iron and steel companies that do not fall under the categories mentioned in the code.In the interest of equal treatment, the code must either be applied or changed.Finally, let me say, Mr. President that the regulations have to be revised with the expiry of the EGKS contract, because in my opinion the aid system must remain beyond 2002.That is why I am for a regulation of the council that guarantees security in this area.	de
(Applause) Mrs. President, we, the Belgian democristians are worried and fortunately many of our colleagues as well.The coalition agreement that is being sealed in one of the member states, of course it is an Austrian issue, but there is no doubt that it also has a European dimension.Because what unites us in Europe is in the first place the values ​​and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights.The president of the Austrian Liberal Party, Haider, has repeatedly expressed his contempt for these values.It also despises the most elementary forms of diplomatic courtesy.He is a dangerous man.A long time ago the democratic parties in my country made the choice, and they are still faithful to that idea, to pay attention to the protest of the voters of the extreme right, but of never negotiating with the leaders of the extreme right.Values ​​must go over power.Therefore, we regret what is happening in Austria.Moreover, we feel completely shivering.We are deeply disappointed.We ask the ÖVP to ultimately seek other solutions.We continue to insist on article 6 of the Treaty.We continue to fight against the banalization of the extreme right.If in the end we get to form a government with this coalition, then we call our ÖVP colleagues to guarantee in the program, both in words and in fact, that the principles and values ​​that are the foundations of European integration are respected.President, ladies, Austria has a great responsibility here.Mrs. President, lordships, it is evident that in this Parliament we largely agree on the rejection of Haider and her policy, but it is also clear that we have differences in the question of how this policy can be fought more effectively.Have you asked on occasion what are the effects in Austria of this debate here and the declaration of the Presidency of the Council of last weekend?Have you raised the question of whether we also have no responsibility for the subsequent evolution of the political situation in Austria when we erect here in judges?Have they wondered on occasion that it would happen if the desire for a colleague was fulfilled and elections in Austria had a place in the next few days?According to the coincident information of all observers, Haider would be even stronger.Who can want this?Do not we have the responsibility to consider how we can combat this policy?Europe is a community of law.Among the principles we have to defend are those of democracy, respect for human rights and that of the rule of law.The democratic mandate includes that although we do not like the decisions taken in the elections, we respect them and therefore we have to respect if the Austrians, for reasons that lie in their policy, decide as they have decided.It is a matter of the rule of law that the presidency of the Council is not expressed as it has done, in a way that contradicts the treaties.	es
"We must prevent, adopt preventive measures in order to prevent this type of disaster from happening again.This is the meaning of the oral question that we have formulated in the name of all the deputies of the Fisheries Commission.We hope that the Commission will present concrete proposals: actions and not lamentations.The Parliament will now approve a proposal for a common resolution of several parliamentary groups, which I consider, Mr. President, ladies, very important and about.Mr. President, the sinking of the Erika on December 12 off the coast of the Breton coast caused a dark tide, the effects of which will be felt for many years.To the destruction of natural resources, we must add the serious impact of this disaster in certain economic sectors, fundamentally those which depend on fishing.The situation can still get worse with the 20,000 tonnes of gross that remain in the compartments of the stranded ship.For the aquiculture and oystering sectors, helpless in the face of pollution which has irreparably reached the coasts, the results were very serious from the first days and also thereafter, due to the loss of market share in these sectors and the rejection of the consumer of a guaranteed product but affected by this pollution.It is ladies and gentlemen, peripheral regions whose economic balance is unstable and which have been deeply affected by this dark tide which is unfortunately not an isolated fact.This region - including other neighboring regions - is mainly based on natural resources.Nature too often punished by human activities that could be avoided if the public authorities controlled them more.""Better to prevent than cure,"" it is said.The budget also says it.Ladies gentlemen, prevention measures are much less expensive than repairs to damage caused by disasters of this scale.Mr. Fischler says that he is present whenever Parliament calls it.However, in the Erika case, he gave the impression -perhaps not to us, but to the inhabitants of Brittany and Vendée -, as a fishing commissioner, not to be there or only partially.As Parliament has already pointed out during the first resolution of January 20, the needs of the fishing industries, oyster farming and tourism, must be taken into account as awarded sectors.This is why we asked the Commission to adopt urgent measures for the fishing sector, through the mobilization of specific funds.Galicia and Brittany, the two European Finistère have both seen themselves affected by these black tides.We do not understand how disasters such as Urquiola and Amoco Cadiz have not served as a lesson to strengthen legislation in the maritime transport sector both in terms of security control for the transport of dangerous products as well as pavilions of convenience.We ask that this time be the last.We ask that the lessons be learned and that we hurry to amend our legislation and fill the gaps that make us always faced with the incredible and that this incredible is nevertheless true.The principle of ""polluter pays"" seems not only necessary, but also justified."	fr
Created in March 1969, it must officially meet every two years, but in fact, it does it every year and makes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice.The organization then issues recommendations for stock conservation.The organization has four permanent committees, made up of national experts, covering the areas of research and statistics, finance and administration, respect as well as conservation and management measures.There are also four working groups for tropical tuna waters, the tuna of northern and southern temperate waters and the other species.These working groups are empowered to initiate regulatory measures with regard to species covered by the Convention.The proposals from these working groups are presented to the Commission, which then offers recommendations to the contracting parties.These recommendations are binding, but the contracting parties have a period of six months during which they can object.As a contracting party, the European Union is required to transpose such recommendations into Community law.During the session it held in November 1998, in Saint-Jacques-de-Compostelle, the Cicta recommended certain modifications of the rules relating to minimum landing sizes for red tuna.The Cicta also issued recommendations in 1974, 1994 and 1996. From now on, it is prohibited to land or sell red tuna 0, of course less than 1.8 kilos.During the November 1998 session, the Cicta's Standing Committee on Research and Statistics were asked to carry out a new assessment of the Red Tuna populations of the Western and Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean.The Committee would therefore provide organization with the information necessary to examine, develop and improve stock reconstruction plans.It was decided that the CPRS should present a study during the 1998 session, highlighting various possible scenarios of stock regeneration, at levels that can produce a lasting maximum return, taking into account the various possible levels of recruitment and mixing stocks.In addition, the study of the CPRS should indicate the monthly fences with the rotating seine, so that the fences are more effective for the conservation of the red tuna.Following this research, the session has agreed that, instead of overall prohibiting red tuna fishing at the rotating seine in the Mediterranean during the period from August 1 to 31, a more selective approach should be implemented.It is important to protect tuna fishing for future generation.The red tuna is the most expensive fish in the world since it would reach up to 90,000 euros per tonne for daily sales at the Triée de Tokyo and of course, the indication of the importance of Mediterranean tuna is that they represent 70 % of all landings in the region, estimated at almost 30,000 tonnes.On this quantity, 80 % are captured at the rotating Senne.The Mediterranean is an important frai area for red tuna, so that it is important to take the necessary measures to strengthen the protection of juveniles.We must respect the minimum size and that we implement the technical measures if we want to eliminate the capture of age 0. The measures adopted in November 1998 came into force on June 21, I repeated, on June 21, 1999, almost 9 months ago, several months before sending communication to the fishing committee.I believe, Mr. Commissioner, that it is not enough and that in the future, we will have to learn from it.	fr
"Now, the truth is that the orientations of the commission do not fully fit those objectives.On the other hand, it is important that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in the sectors of the creation of quality and rights, as well as the effective promotion of equal rights and opportunities, in the support of the social economy and solidarity, to rural development, to small and medium entrepreneurs, to the improvement of the quality of life of urban populations of areas needy, in particular in the sector of social housingsustainable..(IT) If the contents of article 158 of the treaty are aimed at promoting a harmonious development of the community as aFarragosity of the procedures.In fact, despite the normative initiatives, the streamlining of community structures must still be carried out.If there will not be an administrative simplification, the community objectives of reforms inspired by efficacy and concentration can hardly be achieved.In this sense, the commission document suffers from any recommendations to the Member States aimed at simplifying national procedures and regulations on the presentation and processing of projects by national authorities, as well as in terms of financing, action and control.Small and medium enterprises, microenterprises and artisans, in particular, continue to be ""weak subjects"", since precisely the normative and administrative obstacles imposed by some member states, including Italy, they raise great obstacles in order to access structural funds.A considerable handicap is the inability and impossibility of the regions and other agents to program in time, so the commission that, on the basis of the 97/99 decision on the guidelines (Howitts report)) had to have consulted in its day to Parliament, in fact it found a kind of comfortable excuse in the establishment of the reduced programming phase in the Member States and already made public the guidelines in July1999, before the newly elected Parliament undertook his legislative activities preventing Parliament from influencing the current structure of the guidelines.For this reason, the intermediate assessment of article 42 of Regulation No. 1260/99 will be very important.In general, current guidelines lack clarity and transparency.In spite of their importance, they only allude to the issue of the possibility of measuring the progress made based on verifiable objectives and in total tune with the strategies of community policies and do not stop sufficiently in the repercussions of the extension, since they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications in this regard or for regional and national authorities or for candidate countries.That said, the different approach of guidelines that, leaving aside geographical objectives, obey sectorial policies can be positively valued."	es
The exhaustive collection of data that is proposed and their adequate processing will be valid elements to face the revision of the common fishing policy with greater rigor.All this, of course, if the data are obtained.Because, as appropriately observes the rapporteur, the Commission's proposal does not contain any element of mandatory towards the Member States.The transmission of the data by the latter is voluntary while the failure to present them will only result in the loss of a certain economic compensation which, moreover, is not even too high.With the experience gained on the presentation of data in the fishing sector and I refer to the reports on the fulfillment of pop, I believe that we will find ourselves in front, instead of a detailed picture of the situation in the sector, a confused panorama in which some Member States will transmit, for example, scientific data, but not given on employment, while others will provide on employment but not on the situation of resources, depending on whether it is possible,transmit them.Of course, I strongly fear that some will prefer not to obtain funding, if in doing so they will be able to continue to conceal their bad management, which is already found even in cases where the transmission of data was mandatory, as in the aforementioned pop case.Taking into account this deficiency, which I consider the most serious, the report of the Commission for Fishing improves the proposal in some interesting points, especially with the suggestions of the rapporteur on the most reasonable terms of presentation and with the request for a check by the Commission.On my group we supported two requests that I consider reasonable.With the first it is suggested that, in cases where the collection of a series of data proves to be interminable, data from studies and samples are used.With the second, that the data strictly connected to the tax aspect of the companies are eliminated from the Commission's proposal, taking into account, among the other, that these data are not of community competence.In light of all this I believe that the report is appropriate and I ask, on behalf of my group, its approval.First of all, I would like to congratulate me with the honorable Attwouoll for preparing and presented the relationship.I am in favor of the establishment of a community framework for the collection and management of data on fishing, which I consider absolutely essential if you want to adequately evaluate the level of reserves of the various fish species.It is important that these data are of both economic and environmental type and that the information provided by the Member States is standardized throughout the European Union and, as underlined in the report, made compliant with international provisions.I am in favor of the allocation of funds for national programs, also considering the provisions to be observed in relation to the minimum programs.I find myself in agreement with the proposal to also provide the Commission with the information intended for international organizations.Otherwise, the purposes of the collection and aggregation of the data would fall and, in the absence of information, a cautious approach would be applied to apply.It is in the interest of the industry that the information is concrete and is based solely on the facts.	it
".Women suffer from increasing inequalities because they are victims of sexist discrimination which can exercise in an open way (violence, rape, sexual harassment, domestic violence ...) but also more insidiously.This oppression is based on a sexual and social division of work which values ​​the work of men compared to that of women.Salaries are uneven, their work is still perceived as ""extra"" work and more generally the employees do not have access to the same positions of responsibility as men.In addition, family responsibilities are mainly based on them.Women must be entitled to a full -time job, in the same way as men.Coercive laws must be passed to promote professional equality.States must develop a public service for the care of early childhood.Finally, to allow everyone to engage in public life, it takes a massive reduction in working time.It takes a real mix of political, economic and social life.We fight the idea that the biological difference between women and men would cause two visions of the world and two different values ​​systems.Women have the right to be present in the decision -making process as ""individuals"" and not as representatives of the female sex.My colleagues from the British conservative delegation and I are fully committed to responding to the need to increase the number of women actively and fully playing a role in public life.We share the regrets expressed as to the subsistence of inequality and discrimination on the basis of sex and in particular with regard to the under-representation of women in politics.However, we are not convinced that discrimination should be countered by another, namely the introduction of quotas to guarantee seats for women.I feel it in a particularly lively way because Thursday evening, my 27-year-old daughter, Caroline was selected conservative candidate for the district of Southampton Itchen in the United Kingdom.She came to this position totally on the basis of her merits and following a competition against all the participants.We should not adopt a position which in any way decreases the position of the growing number of women who show that they can impose themselves in public life without fear or favor.The members of my delegation and I have therefore supported a large part of the resolution but we oppose the call for positive discrimination in favor of women, which, in our opinion, would not be a good way to move forward, but would actually be degrading for women and would distort the democratic process.As a result, we abstained in the final vote.KATIFORIS report (A5-0041/2000) Mr. President, I voted in favor of the Katiforis report on the assessment of the European Union economy in 1999 by group discipline, because it denounces an extremely serious deficiency which it will contribute, I hope, to eliminate in the coming years.We do not explain clearly, we do not even explain at all, in this report that the economy of the States of the Union also depends and especially the way in which the funds allocated to pensions are used, taken from workers."	fr
If we let Europe be diluted by the extension, we will drown in our own political ciénaga.Mr. President, there are days when I do not understand, the truth, this parliament that feels a masochistic pleasure in self -saving.After having limited Motu proprio his participation in the CIG to two small positions, the Parliament renounces today to complete the agenda of said Cig.Indeed, either due to weakness or foolishness, and none of those options is really glorious - their lordships will recognize - our Parliament, when precipitating to grant his opinion in accordance, leaves the only means of action conferred by the treaty, that is, to demand as a previous issue a full day order of the CIG before pronouncing.Why should we vote that opinion satisfied tomorrow, February 3, urgently, when we could wait, in force, to the opening of the Strasbourg sessions, on February 14, and thus impose an order of the day finally complete and, therefore, consistent?There was little hypocrisy to mask our weakness today.Hypocrisy that we must regret bitterly in our resolution, that the order of the CIG day is not up to the imperatives, when, when we hurry, with a guilty ingenuity, we see the possibility of imposing that most ambitious program.If at the end of this CIG there are democratic gaps, I must say that those responsible will be the political groups that have wanted this precipitation.You want or not, as our Parliament is going to turn off by itself the only reflector that allowed him to clarify the debates a little, the place of decisions will now move towards the fifteen states of the Union.Thus, I ask the deputies of the vast majority of this Parliament that in November they considered that the future of Europe deserved broader debates than the remains of Amsterdam to take their pilgrim felling to stop convincing their government that that CIG should be expanded, since the resolution of the Helsinki Council allows it.Because of Austria's situation, this day is gloomy for Europe.Then we realize that the victory of democracy is never definitive and that we must convince and convince once more.To affirm our fundamental values, it is urgent to put them in writing and, apart from that CIG, I think we owe a Constitution to Europe.Mr. President, in the proposal for resolution that we are discussing, as before, that the future intergovernmental conference has a broad agenda, which contemplates the deep reform of the institutions.The future expansion of the Union is given as an argument for this.I am convinced that this conception is wrong.A federal EU, who tends to centralization and who governs more and more to member countries, will actually be in worse conditions for expansion.A flexible EU, which is concentrated in less but more important issues and that respects national differences and democracies, will be in better conditions to encompass many other countries.	es
Throughout this conference, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the status of negotiators that is important, it is the quality of what they will say.And I want to recall once again in front of your parliament, given the experience that was mine before Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or the weakness of the status that had been recognized by the two representatives of the European Parliament, before Amsterdam, the quality of what Ms. Guigou and Mr. Brok said in this negotiation.I am sure that it will be the same and as far as I am concerned, in the place which is mine, I will ensure that the ideas carried by your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout this negotiation.I am sure that the European Parliament will not be a spectator of this negotiation, not more elsewhere that the commission will not be a spectator.We are therefore waiting for now, ladies and gentlemen, with great interest, your later opinion in which you will specify the priorities and concrete proposals of the Parliament for this negotiation.It is of great importance that the two European institutions which will be present in these negotiations, the Commission, on the one hand, the European Parliament, on the other, alongside the members of the Council, clearly explain to the citizens of the Union, always explain and every day to the citizens of the Union, what are the challenges of this conference and what answers we recommend, as a European institutions responsible for ensuring the good functioning of this enlargedThe common interest.In the coming months, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Commission will therefore work in close consultation, in good intelligence, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Elmar Brok, in order to bring our points of view, if it is needed.Probably our points of view and our positions will not always be the same, there will undoubtedly be differences, as it is normal.What is important is that there is coherence, and it is to work in this coherence that I committed myself from the start of my functions within the college.We therefore have the concern and the ambition, on a very large number of themes, to be on the same length of waves and to carry this negotiation upwards.It will not be a coincidence, since, I repeat, it seems to me that we have the same ambition for this negotiation and we feel together that it constitutes a moment of truth for the European Union.I would finally like to make three additional observations, quickly, the president.First, to congratulate and thank the President Napolitano and the Constitutional Affairs Committee for the extremely strong and original initiative which was taken yesterday by bringing together the qualified representatives of national parliaments, the Constitutional Affairs Committee and the Commission for a first common debate.This dialogue between national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important.I said that I would take my part there by going to each of the national parliaments myself.	fr
If change applications are accepted that soften the directive, this would be extremely negative, not only for the environment, but also for the credibility of the European Parliament in environmental issues.In today's pronunciation it was pointed out that the millions of people who find work in the auto industry are just as little forgotten as the countries with a strongly developed automotive industry, such as:B. my home country of Sweden.I myself was a car worker before my choice and I am certainly one of the few in this parliament who stood on a assembly line and assembled cars.In my opinion, high requirements have to be placed on the motor vehicle industry, because this favors the modern, environmentally conscious and quickly developed automobile manufacturers.And we have to promote this type of auto industry in the European Union.Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for Parliament, as well as for the citizens of Europe.STARE vehicles disguise the environment and represent a serious impairment for them. Our citizens expect us to represent their interests in this regard.Every year, eight to nine million cars are scrapped in the European Union.This alone is a huge amount of waste.Vehicle and parts manufacturers and the suppliers of materials have to strive to limit the use of dangerous substances as far as possible.It is therefore already to be secured in the design phase that recycled fabrics can be used in vehicle production.We know that there are recycling systems approved in the Netherlands for the recording of old vehicles, and I think that we should introduce them throughout the European Union.As for Ireland, I know that the Irish Ministry of the Environment has taken consultations with representatives of the automotive industry, the aim of which is to introduce suitable centers in the near future for the recording of waste vehicles in Ireland.In my opinion, there is no reason that speaks against the Europe -wide conclusion of concession agreements for recycling plants, in which the eight to nine million vehicles, which are retired annually in the European Union, are brought to the scrapping.The automotive manufacturers must provide information on the reused, rewriting and recycling rates for used cars provided for for the next few years.According to the new provisions of the Amsterdam contract, the 370 million consumers in the European Union have the right to consumer -specific information.I am convinced that consumers will support those automotive manufacturers in the EU who will introduce the most environmentally friendly practices in the coming year.In conclusion, I would like to determine that relevant regulations and laws should take into account the special position of the classic car industry in the European community, which plays a special role in terms of social, economic and ecological issues.President, dear colleagues!With the guideline for old vehicles, a milestone is undoubtedly set on the way to improving the environment in our European Union.In my opinion, huge efforts were also made in order to achieve reasonable material recycling and reducing environmental waste and to promote technological innovation.From this point of view, we are certainly on the right track, but as has already been emphasized by some colleagues, the real problem is that the manufacturers may only be responsible.	de
"The word is to Mr. Rübig.Mr. President, fourteen Member States have taken bilateral sanctions against a Member State, because a democratically elected government has been trained.The two parties have already participated in the government.They have not committed any legal offense until today.Are preventive sanctions compatible with the human rights charter?A right of veto of the President of the Council for National Government Training would he be compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?Is the appeal to violent demonstrations compatible with the Charter of fundamental rights?The deputy, as the chairman in office of the Council, I have no answer to give you for the simple reason that the position of the Portuguese Prime Minister, on behalf of the fourteen heads of state and government of the Member States of the European Union, took place on a bilateral level and not on that of the Presidency of the European Union.I would like to say, however, that all the preventive actions that have been adopted on the strictly bilateral level by the Member States of the European Union concerns a set of actions of nature, I would say, from political prophylaxis on the diplomatic level, which seems perfectly justified and which seems to us to go in the sense of what is reasonable in the face of the behavior of a party and personalities of this party which do not seem to give the guarantees to be ableof which he would be part.I would not like to expand on this question in the name of the presidency of the Union because it is an intervention that my government has made at the request and in collaboration with fourteen member states and not as the presidency of the European Union.Mr. President, I have the honor to be part of the convention which writes the Charter, I will therefore not ask the presidency to speculate on its content or if it thinks that the Convention should be declaratory or if it should have legal force.I would like to know what will happen to the Charter project that the Convention is writing.Will the council process it like a document which he must accept as it is, or will the council consider himself free to amend this document?Will the council simply say yes or no to this project or will it be in a position to rework this charter project once again?The answer is neither yes nor no.I do not know, Mr. MP, it will depend on the decision taken at the level of the council.Question nº 8 of (H-0042/00): Purpose: granting of export credits guarantees and consequences for the construction of the Ilisu dam in Turkey the G8 gathered in Cologne invited the OECD to initiate a process of establishing joint standards in the field of the granting of guarantees of export credits.Indeed, these guarantees can be used to distort competition and finance questionable projects.The European Union takes the initiative in the launch of this process?The need has been demonstrated recently when the British government said it was ""willing to grant"" a license in export credits to a company participating in the construction of the Ilisu dam in Türkiye."	fr
It must be evident that the subsidiarity comes into play, i.h.It must be clear that we do not act in areas where it is not necessary.The second problem affects households.In view of a growth rate that is higher than the 2.5 % in the financial foresight, we can take other measures with regard to households than we would otherwise have done.On behalf of my faction, I would like to warn the commission against relocating agricultural editions from Category 1 according to Category 4.Especially in the UK, agriculture is in a desperate location and hopes to be a certain support for certain areas of the sector.A relocation of the funds provided for agriculture from one budget category to another would send the wrong signals at the present time.Finally, a word of caution on the question of information.This problem has burdened the relationships between our parliament and the previous commission, because according to the contracts we basically have access and the right to access to all information.It looks as if our framework agreement could be difficult.I therefore emphasize that we have to clarify this problem as soon as possible and that there are no restrictions on documents that are accessible to the citizen if we want the commission and parliament work together.As Mr. Bonde realized correctly, it is about creating a European Union in which there is a unhindered flow of information between the administrative structures and all of our citizens.Dear Mr Commission President!When they took office, they said that the commission should be characterized by transparency.That has already been addressed several times today.But what is the situation now?Why are the commission's press conferences no longer broadcast directly via satellite so that everyone can follow throughout Europe?I hope that Mr. Prodi listens.Mr President Prodi!As for Ms. Fontaine on the question of the civil officer: Do you assume that the civic representative is bound by a principle of loyal cooperation between the institutions?Where do you find a legal basis in this case, and do you think that such a principle could suppress the right of the civic officer to freely comment on the press?In addition, I would like to inform about the following facts with a view to your letter to the editor in Wall Street Journal.There they refer to a seminar for transparency as proof that the regulation has been drawn up under transparent conditions.This seminar has been organized by the European Federation of Journalists, the MP Lööw, Thors and Haitala and others, but the proposal discussed there has nothing to do with the current one.The latter has been created in secret.Above all, however, the commission president, the question arises as to whether the principle of loyal cooperation should have priority over the principle of freedom of expression.Where is such a principle underpinning with which you could suppress this right and confront the civic representative with such claims?Mr President, I will only deal with some aspects of their very demanding and comprehensive report.	de
"Why would I not say that we have noticed, on the part of the Greek government, in the past years, a certain deficiency with regard to the application of the new regulation and the previous regulation for the association of representatives of civil society.I say it objectively and when we see a problem or a deficiency, it is necessary to delete this problem or this deficiency.So, I will watch out for the implementation of the new community support framework.I call question No. 45 of (H-0041/00): Subject: Financing by structural research funds in the Civil Nuclear field The unwanted commission confirm that in the last programming period of structural funds 19941999, no support was allocated to research in the field of nuclear fission and fission?Little also undertake to exclude any measure of financing this type of research during the ongoing negotiations with the Member States in terms and programs of the new period 20002006?What role, on the other hand, will play the contribution of structural funds to the promotion of renewable energies?Can we expect the financing of structural funds in terms of energy policy to promote regional and renewable energy resources?Will structural funds also finance large energy transport networks?I would like to answer Ms. Isler Béguin on the first point and remind her that improving the scientific base and the technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the community priorities during the previous programming period.The support allocated by the structural funds in favor of technological cohesion, that is to say research and technological development in the context of community support managers during this period, is estimated at around 7.5 billion euros.It is roughly, Madam MP, 6 % of the total community contribution.Regarding precisely your concern, I want to tell you that without the previous period, the Commission does not have the intention to directly finance research and technological development in the field of nuclear merger or fission through structural funds.It remains in the responsibility of the authorities for the management of the member states to select the projects which are implemented within the framework of these CCAs.Consequently, the deputy, even if this does not constitute a priority of the community, a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the field of civil nuclear, provided that these projects contribute to regional development and without systematically informing the Commission.Regarding your second point which, you know, interests me and continues to interest me a lot, renewable energies, the commission approach is presented in the document on structural funds and their coordination with the cohesion fund.These provide that investments in the renewable energies sector must be encouraged insofar as they promote the development of local resources, where they contribute to the reduction of dependence on energy imports and are also creative of jobs at the local level.I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit that I made in Portugal, a few days ago in the Azores, being a natural source of renewable energy.The contribution of structural funds, in favor of greater penetration of the renewable energies market, was also highlighted in the campaign for the takeoff of renewable energy sources, launched by the general management ""Transport and Energy""."	fr
Three problems still need clarification.The first is about the transfer of water between catchment areas.My colleagues in Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom are affected.The amendments 4, 49 and 87 would be unacceptable because they would limit the possibilities of a country to redistribute water in which it would be plentiful to needy areas, such as low -precipitation or cities.Second, we have to face goals, but they have to be realistic.A look at the change of change No. 7, which demands the complete switching off of naturally incurred substances, shows that some of the goals set are unrealistic.In addition, some of the goals provide values ​​close to zero;A wording that makes little sense in English.We have to deal with it again.The concept of continuous reduction used in amendment no. 58 is much better.Third, I would like to address the problem of Scottish whiskey.The production of Scottish whiskey and above all Malt whiskey, the best whiskey, requires the removal of considerable amounts of water, which are then returned to the river.However, part of the water gets into the bottle and is drunk.We have to ensure that the change applications No. 49 and 87 do not cancel the exemption, so that it is still possible to enjoy high -quality whiskey.In this context, this means that good Scottish peat water must be used.My third concern is that we check these measures in detail before we pass the measure as a whole.Mr President, First of all, we want to denounce the bottomless hypocrisy of those who pretend to sacrifice themselves for the environment and water, and at the same time through criminal actions such as the attack on Yugoslavia not only thousands of dead and wounded on the conscience, but also huge ecological devastation, also caused by water resources, not only unusable, but even extremely harmful to health.As for the report itself, we think that the application of the principle of cost recovery in water services is by no means to be used to add additional taxation economically weaker or even to exterminate small and medium -sized farmers, who may then no longer be able to afford to irrigate their cultures.We also point out that infrastructure projects for water savings have to be financed in regions with acute lack of water such as in my country, especially on the islands.This saving is not to be achieved by increasing the amount, but by increasing the crowd, especially by catching rainwater, which is currently unused, flows into the sea and causes the erosion of the soil with all the resulting problems.In this respect, we support the amendment 107 of colleague Marset Campos.It is also necessary that the optimal use of river water ensures life in regions with chronic lack of water.The claim of the Council, which the Commission has also joined, does not require many concrete information and explanations, because these points are covered by the examples of the directive or are contained there in other places can only be understood as a point.In this way, one wants to continue to act in a very opaque field because it is possible in the first implementation phase of the directive to fix critical decisions in favor of major capital.	de
President, dear colleagues!I do not need to repeat what the woman said, nor what the colleague Coelho has already carried out.This is all right and correct.The euro can be easily fake.We are in a dangerous transition phase in which - I believe in the history of money - probably unique phenomenon occurs, namely that a money that has not yet existed, which is not yet in circulation, but is only available as a book money, can still be fake, but due to the fact that it is not yet in circulation as a currency, the criminal offense at this point in time cannot be effective.A very complicated problem.This means that if we don't act quickly - the colleague Cederschiöld is right - you can already do a few wrong euros and may not be held accountable for their inum order.For some, I allow myself to say in passing, that may be an attractive view.What is the European Union about?A lot of real things that the colleague Cederschiöld described, but the parliament in connection with what she has described must say something less about the content of the framework decision, also less about the report that the colleague Cederschiöld wrote about it, but say something, but about the procedures that are applied.The European Parliament has been consulted by the Council, which has been consulted with a wide distance in Europe, in a way that speaks mockery to the concept of democracy.We have been sent a text for the consultation, where the Council itself made a very long period of time, by the way, only to share with success - I can talk about it right away.The European Parliament should now comment on this complex, difficult, partly contradictory paper of the Council within three months.It is only thanks to the enormous use of the colleague Cederschiöld and the waiver of the European Parliament to make use of its democratic law in sufficient time and with the availability of all texts in all languages ​​to carry out his consultation procedure that we can now come to a statement and thus to the upcoming decision in March.With such an important issue as that of falsification of money or protection against falsification of money and criminal harmonization, which is necessary for this, you cannot actually work in this pork gallop that the Council demands.That is why I want to say in all clarity for my faction: We have long discussed with the colleague Cederschiöld about whether it makes sense to work like this.We came to the conclusion that it is not the case, but in view of the importance of the object, we agreed to accept the procedure in this way.This framework decision is without a doubt.Only, the legal certainty that was actually desired by the Council - the colleague Cederschiöld has already carried out - is not fully achieved in the end, because with the intended minimum standards, the minimum standard of criminal liability and, above all, the use of the same criminal law standards in all member countries - even in those who have not yet been introduced in which the euro could not be fake - these deficits have not been remedied.	de
Evidently, we pay the price of our own neglect because our countries, with the blessing of the community, have considered it appropriate to no longer have a merchant fleet of their own and have left a profound competence in the field of naval construction, we do not have more than a clear traceability of the ships and we see authentic ship-patron-sauceIt is absolutely necessary to end the avalanche of irresponsibility, irresponsible renters, unobtainable shipowners, compliant classification companies.Today, the utmost confusion reigns.Obviously these issues must be treated worldwide, but the current international rules of OMI are completely insufficient and too laxist.Neither our countries nor the Commission attempted with tenacity to make them more rigorous despite the previous catastrophes.Certainly, there is the International Compensation Fund for pollution from hydrocarbons, the fipp, but it dilutes responsibilities and provides ceilings at an insufficient level that must be reviewed.The question of the convenient flags in Omi must be subjectedly reviewed.To this end, it is the task of the Member States and the Community to undertake the necessary initiatives.I remember that the Erika beat the convenient flag of a candidate for the European Union.On the other hand, there are Community directives which, however, are little or not at all applied due to the insufficient number of national controllers.It is necessary to remedy this deficiency urgently.A directive on maritime safety has been under preparation for many years but has been going on very reduced speed.From this point of view there is an inadmissible inertia and an unacceptable ignor of the Commission.The date of presentation of the Commission's communication on this essential problem has been continuously postponed and now scheduled for July but must be absolutely anticipated.The provisions of merit that must be predicted must be clear and severe.I will quote three of them priority from our group.Firstly, the responsibility of the owners of the oil load must be determined clearly and the victims of pollution must be able to resort to any ambiguity.For the future, the best prevention will be the certainty for the rentals of a heavy, civil, criminal and pecuniary condemnation, if they are not quite vigilant on the safety of the ships they choose.Second, it is necessary to impose as quickly as possible, without referring to the Greek calends, the condition of the double hull for the oil tankers admitted to furrowing the community waters.Third, it is necessary to urgently set a rigorous limit of seniority of ships admitted to navigate in community waters: it could be 15 years old.In the absence of a sufficiently clear, severe and rigorous community regulatory framework, the Member States who want to elaborate one, should be authorized to do so to protect the populations and their territory, exactly as the United States have been able to draw a lesson from the catastrophe of the Exxon Valdez by demanding the double hull and banding all the ships more than twenty years from their waters.For this reason the United States had refused Erika's access to their waters.	it
To achieve the goals mentioned, also with the support of the Commission, both the funds and the policies of the new program financed by the social fund for the period 2002-2006 are to be used.The Commission will observe carefully to what extent the Greek government fulfills the obligations taken over by it.I thank the commissioner for her answer.But, Ms. Commissioner, the situation is as follows: In terms of the unemployment rate, we are in second place in Europe with 11.3 % -it was not that bad in the past -we have the highest increase in unemployment and the lowest expenses for unemployed, namely less than 1 % of GDP, while other countries (e.g. France, Belgium and Germany) spend 3-4 %.In addition, it is not clear how the funds provided from the social fund were used to combat unemployment.They spoke of the fact that some recommendations have been made by the Commission.It's pretty good and beautiful, but now it is really to be hoped that these recommendations will also follow acts.However, the following question has been concerned for a long time: What about the previous policies?Has anyone found work?How many have received a job?If you cannot provide us with any information for the current year, then for the last or the penultimate.What about training and further education?Should the infamous training centers give the work that train there or those who are trained there?Are there any concrete figures?So do we have the opportunity to control what comes out of the Greek government's policy?Mr. Papayannakis, I can only explain to you on your question that the Greek government must indeed be more intensive to capture the statistical data electronically in relation to the existing structures, so that the implemented programs also provide the quantitative results you mentioned and is possible to control the situation on the basis of which corresponding policies can be designed.In Greece there was an increase in the employment rate and - as far as I can see here - a productivity growth.The Commission can work where it is about the specific guidelines.As is well known, each country is assessed using 22 guidelines.They refer to access to training opportunities, each as a percentage broken down for men and women, and the special measures for long -term unemployed.The Commission will try to quantify the data for all concrete objectives and, on the basis of the implementation of the new community campaign framework, to get specific information for the period 2000-2006.Inquiry No. 36 of (H-0782/99): Applies: Danish early retirement regulation can the Commission inform whether the Danish early retirement regulation has been approved as a whole and whether there are differences between Denmark and the Commission in other social policy areas?According to the Danish pension system Efterløn, only people with residence in Denmark who have provided the necessary number of years of working in this country can receive pension.Some employees complained to the European Commission that they have no pension entitlement.However, the Danish authorities are not obliged to pay this compensation to the employees in early retirement if they do not meet the conditions defined in Danish law.	de
The stumbling block in negotiations with the Council lies, of course, on the amount of the financial envelope provided for the third stage of the LIFE program (2000-2004).The committee's proposal ratified by the Council is 613 million euros while the Environment Commission estimates that the budget should be 850 million euros.I support the firmness of the rapporteur.Indeed, the financial endowment has not been adapted since the creation of this program, or even during the transition to fifteen Member States following the expansion of the EC.If the report is adopted in plenary, a conciliation must be opened, as provided for in the codecision procedure, to resolve the question of the amount of credits provided for the program.This kind of procedure is common practical since programs or legislative measures are too often equipped with budgets unsuitable for ambitions!Böge report (A5-0023/2000) as a European deputy, and especially as a citizen-consumer, I welcome the European Commission's proposal which marks one more step in the direction of better food security within the European Union.This proposal is twofold: it is a question, on the one hand, of modifying the 1991 council directive relating to the conditions of health police by removing the provisions which concern the trembling of sheep, and, on the other hand, to set up a new regulation establishing the rules of prevention and fight against certain transmissible spongiforms (east) or ESB -type diseases, affecting the Mouton andAnimal.The interest of this new legislation lies in the fact that a specific legal basis is created for the fight against the trembling of the sheep.I am all the more satisfied as it was one of our main requests in our follow -up report on the crazy cow crisis.It also seems essential to me, for the sake of consistency, to melt the existing legislation relating to the trembling, limited to trade in sheep and goats, in a single complete device of new rules governing them affecting all animals in the whole of the European Union, rules intended to prevent the consumption of food or food for animals.This regulation is as welcome as doubts always exist on the trembling of the sheep.Certain scientific hypotheses argue that the trembling of the sheep could have evolved to become the ESB among cattle and thus be at the origin of the ESB epizootic.Even if the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the prevention and the fight against certain is requested to be specified and strengthened, in particular with regard to the detection and the fight against the trembling, it represents a significant improvement.It is a guarantee given to European citizens who have testified, on many occasions, of their concerns about European food policy.Their concerns, relayed by our European Parliament, were heard.The debates relating to the precautionary principle, traceability, responsibility, transparency, led the European Commission to present a white paper relating to food security.This white paper launches several avenues for reflection and has notably proposed the creation of an independent European food authority.All of this is a European strategy to regain consumer confidence.	fr
Mr. President, I would like to thank the Commissioner Patten for having shown himself as aware of the difficulties that the peace process and the challenge that the European Union must be present for this process.In the Middle East, it is really time for peace to settle;It is time to complete the historic phase which started with the declaration of Balford in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948;It is time for each country in the region to have safe borders, that political, social and economic rights exist, human rights recognized and practiced in Syria, Palestine and Israel, everywhere.For each people and each person, it is also a question of sovereignty and democracy but to do this, it is essential that each party in conflict has the courage to promote peace and respect for rights, that it recognizes the other as a partner and not as a subject to whom concessions should be made.I mainly refer to Nud Palestine-Israel, but this also applies to the Golan's territories, occupied since 1967, and South Lebanon since 1982. Israel must assume its responsibilities, withdraw from occupied territories and share water resources, but at the same time, it must be certain of its own security and be able to live in peace by practicing economic and political exchange with all the countries of the region.Security, however, does not only concern Israel.This applies to the other countries, first for the Palestinians who still live under military occupation and who, even today, despite the agreements signed from Oslo, see their land confiscated in areas B and C. After Oslo and until October 17, 1999, 174 thousand dunans of land were confiscated, of which 8462 under the new Barak government: the trees were uprooted, the housesEast Jerusalem, the use of water has been reduced or even prohibited, while the locations continue and are constantly increasing.However, there is no doubt that the elections of the new government have made progress;At least, negotiations resumes.However, in the Middle East, there can only be stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians have a clean state, that if they can move freely inside their territory.The international community must simply implement resolutions 332, 248, 245 and 194. We are worried about the referral to relations with Syria, as well as by the decision of Prime Minister Barak to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and by the charm-el cheikh agreements.We believe that it is vital that the European Union plays a political role in the negotiations equivalent to the role it plays in terms of economic aid.We cannot just stay behind the scenes, on the contrary, we must be leading actors, without risking colliding with the United States, as Minister Gama said.	fr
It is in fact the impression that they both think that Petersberg's missions will eventually be taken up by the Union's defense policy.The treaties also go in this direction, but they leave even greater openness to a more general defense policy which is closer to the old discourse relating to the integration of our policy in a European block.We would therefore express ourselves via this European block within NATO.To tell the truth, I hear less and less often speak.I have the impression that the European Union has reduced its ambitions to the missions of Petersberg and that Mr. Patten takes care of civil affairs, including the police and civil servants quickly mobilized, which he just talked about with enthusiasm, while Mr. Solana takes care of military means and military engagement, all in a perfect spirit of cooperation.It seems to me to go without saying.But is there really nothing else?In terms of defense policy, isn't the emphasis on the role of NATO in collective defense?The European block, which no longer works as such, is limited to the missions of Petersberg.Is this really what we want?We are also talking about the integration of the Union of Western Europe into the European Union, but it is no longer a question of article V that we follow of course very closely since it does not only deal with Petersberg, but also larger defense missions.Is this article removed?In general, we also speak of an increase in budgets allocated to La Défense.I think it is a good thing, but no clear distinction is made in this plea between the missions of Petersberg and the biggest collective defense missions.I wonder how the situation is evolving.I would in fact like to ask Mr. Patten and Mr. Solana how they consider things in the end.Is it necessary to pay more attention to it during the CIG or can it naturally flow from treaties?I am satisfied that an opening was created in defense policy.But I ask myself questions: what will happen if Turkey offers a brigade?Should we authorize this country to take part in decisions concerning this policy?On the structural level, there are haider in the Turkish government.It seems strange to me.Baltic states are also arising.Will they also participate in our defense policy?This is at least a very interesting situation.High representative, you have effectively recalled the progress made in this area between Amsterdam and Helsinki, as well as some of the decisions made after Helsinki, such as the constitution of the three committees and the decision to create the contingent of 50 to 60,000 men, decisions also recently arrested, during the informal meeting of Sintra.However, this acceleration makes the gap between these decisions and the intergovernmental conference in progress even more obvious.	fr
"Of course, we must not lose sight of competitiveness, but social protection must be designed in such a way that it contributes to economic growth and employment.In my opinion, this also becomes clear in the report.After a unanimous decision of the Council, our goal is to start coordinating, exchanging views, the recording of social problems and the establishment of a database for better coordination of the policies next year.I agree with the opinion of many MPs that a first important step is taken.At the Government Conference, a broader approach will already be recognizable for questions of social policy.Now we are likely to have reached a new phase in which social policy is significantly a European policy.Thank you very much, Ms. Diamantopoulou.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.WIPO contract according to the agenda follows the pronunciation of the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Ms. Cederschiöld on behalf of the Committee on Law and Inner Market for the proposal for a decision for a decision on the approval-in the name of the European Community-to the Wipo consulting law contract and the wipo contract for performances and recordings (COM (1998) 24-C5-022/1999-1998/0141 (AVC)).President!Here we comment on an important question, an international contract in an area that can influence the development of prosperity in many Member States.In my home country of Sweden, for example, one of the largest export industries is affected.It is about music and sound recordings, about the rights of the artists on the copyright protection of their artistic products.The WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the Wppt (World Perfoma and Phonograms Treaty) are up for debate.Without the protection of intellectual property, the financial incentives and creativity are inhibited.Force has become a big business.In Europe alone, it is expected by pirated copies with loss of income of 4.5 billion euros, a problem that also affects many jobs in the entertainment industry.This is a historical contract because the European Union is one of the contracting pages, even though the EU does not include the EU, but only the Member States of the organization.There is a special clause according to which the consent of the parliament is required in two cases.As far as this contract is concerned, both conditions are fulfilled here: a new institution, a ""assembly"" is created, which will continue to deal with the contract and its effects in the future.In addition, the contract affects questions that must be treated according to the co -decision.So the parliament must give its consent because its responsibility is touched.The future will show whether it is right to restrict the responsibility of the Commission in these questions through this new parliamentary assembly.In any case, the parliament cannot do anything at the moment.The contract completes the Bern agreement on the protection of literary works.International legal protection for distribution, sales, rental, public reproduction and provision is created, as well as protection for computer programs and databases.However, there are problems in the case of the ""author"", since this term is not defined, for example.Another question that can lead to complications is the intermediate storage.A general clause is provided for this in the contract, which, however, does not contain a definition."	de
When the United States and NATO, and finally also the EU reacted, it was already late, very late.Many suffering could have been avoided, if in particular the EU had acted earlier and more clearly.The EU therefore has a particular responsibility to assume, when helping and assisting the Balkans in their reconstruction.Our priority objective must be to create the necessary conditions so that all countries in southeast Europe can be integrated, with others, in the EU - on the economic, commercial and political level.The best method to create, in this part of Europe ravaged by war, the breeding ground for democracy, goes through trade and economic integration.The members of the Liberal group are ready to act quickly and in depth, as Mr. Paolo Costa said.This is why we welcome the proposal for stabilization and association with the most satisfaction with the Macedonia that was presented to us, and we thank Mr. Swoboda for the high quality of its report.Macedonia deserves our support, especially if we think of the sacrifices and altruistic work that were made by the population and the leaders of this country during the Kosovo War.As Macedonia is very difficult to extract from the destructive rets of communism and nationalism, it is up to us to act without any ambiguity, and to support them.And we have to do as much for the other Balkan countries.It is for the EU an imperative duty.Mr. President, allow me here to remind the members of this assembly - by making the link with a subject which we discussed earlier, during this evening - that the man who carries the main responsibility of this war, violations of human dignity, assassinations and the expulsion of innocent people outside their home, continues to direct what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia.This man who is accused of genocide and who should appear before the International Criminal Tribunal of The Hague is still in freedom.I'm talking about Mr. Milosevic.As long as it will remain in power and Serbia will not be committed to the path of democracy, this country will represent a threat to peace in the Balkans - including for Macedonia.Mr. President, the proposed agreement will constitute the first application of the stability agreement in Southeast Europe.It is obvious that the terms of this agreement, which the Swoboda report adopts, do not have peace for objective but rather a political and economic mastery of the country more important, the exploitation of its natural wealth, the hyperexploitation of the workers' potential and the use, to a greater extent, of the country as a bridgehead against the other countries and the peoples of the region which resist the new order.And all this in exchange for the promise of future membership in the European Union.The report accepts these guidelines, as well as the more general policy of the European Union in favor of Southeast Europe.It is typical to note that the report sends its congratulations to ARYM for its constructive attitude adopted during the attack by NATO, that it praises its peaceful role, for having accepted the parking of the NATO forces on its territory.Naturally, the exasperation of the people, manifested through mass movements during NATO bombings, has passed over in silence.	fr
Much.Mr President of the Commission!If you read your white book about the reform of the Commission, you cannot avoid finding that the guideline, the idea on which this reform is based, is something very tasted that we cannot accept in this parliament.This guideline essentially exists in the protection of the community's financial interests.Of course, this is our concern, but it is only the starting point.Based on this, the Commission must start working, it must fulfill its obligations that it has according to the contract.Let me give you an example, because in the speaking time I don't have many ways to explain this idea.Let us take the reform mentioned in connection with the violation procedures.What is intended?It is simply that it is about managing the resources available at the respective level instead of complying with the demands of this parliament, for reasons of legal certainty to create a real administrative procedure right, which is necessary from the perspective of the European citizen, that is, from the perspective of those who can initiate this violation.It is simply said that this administrative procedure is not created, but that the lawsuits are selected.How?Just as these things are selected, purely arbitrary.From the point of view of this parliament, such derivations cannot be approved.We understand that the commission must be reformed, we share the goals of this reform, but of course not in such a way that for an important interest that is of all interest - namely the protection of the financial interests of the community - the great impulse of the European structure is overwhelmed, an impulse that is primarily responsible for the commission based on the commission based on the contract.Thank you very much, Mr. Prodi, for your presentation and your documentation.Congratulations on the use of the Internet for the general public - a very good idea.I want to start trading.We agree with you that we need a trading system that is subject to certain rules.It really depends on that.Seattle failed because, in particular, the United States, in particular, were unable to understand that measures such as environmental protection, the preservation of rural communities are legitimate by shared agricultural policy, animal welfare, health protection and social rights.With regard to the legitimate fears of the developing countries, they proved an astonishing level of instinctuallessness, and there is little, there is little that the developing countries of the WTO could have been grateful for so far.We expect the European Union to continue the negotiations and to adhere to our immovable point of view in all of these questions.At the same time, with the help of our contacts with the developing countries, it must be ensured that the next round will be a fair round.If we could have detailed suggestions in the next three months, how to do this.Innovation and knowledge - a topic that is appropriate to the new century.How much innovation did the commission take place and, if I can say, in parliament?A few years ago we had a white book for innovation - what has happened since then?I would like to find one thing here with great emphasis, namely that we are concerned with follow -up measures, not just about an excellent message that we welcome, but about follow -up measures, follow -up measures and follow -up measures !!!	de
I think it is very serious, in the institutional level, that progresses towards the substitution of collegial decisions that the treaty obliges the European Union for bilateral decisions between governments.I am not discussing the background of the Austrian issue, I am discussing the serious precedent that can be sitting, if the collegiality imposed by bilateral decisions is replaced: today against one country, tomorrow against another or other countries.That is the first issue.The second issue addresses the problem of the employment summit.I was convinced - among other things because I attended the debates that gave rise to the registration of employment problems in the agenda of the Council and in the European Union - that the original intention of the employment summit was to fight against the problems, not of the new knowledge economy, but of the old European economy, the problems of unemployment that exist in the factories, in the astillers, in the metallurgiaThose were the employment problems that were originally presented as an order of the Employment Summit.And, therefore, it makes the greatest sense to raise the question of whether, when talking about the problems of the new knowledge economy, of the new digital economy -which I know, it has not yet created jobs in Europe -, an inability to act against the problems of the unemployment of the present so that in large part is a rhetoric about the problems of the employment of the future ... nobody understands more than all of us, nobody, nobody understands, nobody understands more than all of us.To the digital economy and the knowledge economy, but those of the Employment Summit were not those.The president of the Council has concluded with a vaguely ideological note and less bad.If that is the social democratic policy for the economy of the future, I must remind you that one of the most serious problems related to the Internet economy and the delay in Europe is the lack of business spirit registered in the teaching system, in the performance of governments, in the functioning of institutions.And against that is what you should fight to guarantee the knowledge economy of the future.Mr. President of the Council, I would first welcome him in the European Parliament, very particularly to symbolize with his appearance what the president of the group of European socialists has already said here, which is the political symbolism of having also come in full tour of the capitals, to hear the European Parliament.It is not the first time that, during the Portuguese presidency, there is a different and politically stimulating relationship between the Council and the Parliament, but it is, in fact, a significant gesture, as my partner Barón Crespo has observed, and we are pleased to state.Our position is clear: we support the initiative of the Portuguese government, because it is a serious initiative and its content, both in the strategic objectives and in other objectives with which we identify ourselves.	es
They must also be persecuted in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements that the community negotiates.While communication reveals the valuable intentions of the commission in this sector, it also shows the absence of certain activities and where improvements of control and management can be made.You can textually cite communication.Overexploitation is so intense in community fishing that scientific authorities have recommended the rapid reduction of exploitation levels by up to 40%.This appeared in the communication last July.Since then, the Fishing Council meeting of December 16 decided on drastic reductions in the total allowed captures of certain species such as cod or anchovy, which in the region amounted to 2000 to 25% for cod and 43% for anchovy.In addition, the Commission adopted an emergency regulation for the recovery of the cod of the Ireland Sea, effectively establishing a break in cod fishing in the Ireland Sea between February 14 and April 13 due to the crisis of this species.These are examples of the serious problems facing the fishing sector caused by overexploitation.What can be done to relieve the damage caused to fishing communities?The first consideration must be the recognition that community legislation must be reinforced and that improved control procedures.Second, the principles of community legislation must be extended to international agreements in which the community is a party.Third, the European Union must act to improve the monitoring and prevention of the contamination in the community waters that is harmful to marine life including fishery resources.More controls should be introduced to avoid oil discharge as in the case of Erika in the Vizcaya Gulf and the intentional discharge of residual fuels.The pressure to which the marine system is subjected by the urbanization of coastal areas must also be recognized.This pressure is huge in the case of Europe.In this context you can also mention the problem of the waste of unwanted captures, fishing supplies that destroy the seabed and the destruction of natural habitats due to superintensure aquaculture.A fees management system such as the one in New Zealand since 1986 constitutes a possible alternative.Under this system and given the total allowed catches, a market for individual fishing rights quotas is created within a certain area that the holders of those rights can negotiate with each other, use them for fishing or temporarily yield to other fishermen.The property right that has been created in a system of these characteristics is the right to fish -not the fish itself.A market organization of this type can harvest better long -term perspectives for the fishing industry.Dear colleagues, currently we cannot be completely informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea, nor multiple factors that affect resource reserves in this marine system.However, we must not give up scientific research, we should never stop collecting information, we must not stop exploring the improvements of existing systems and if necessary at least we should consider the change in policies.	es
As far as social protection is concerned, I can confirm that we have made suggestions on the area of ​​the qualified majority and the area of ​​unanimity without ideological ulterior motives.In your country, Mr. Bonde, as well as anywhere else, you attach great importance to the smooth functioning of the internal market, on the best possible conditions for competition as well as free goods and passenger transport.And we let ourselves be guided by it.In fact, we indicate that certain policies or measures in the area of ​​tax policy, social protection or social security are decided with a qualified majority if they are directly related to the smooth functioning of the internal market.Our proposal is not a general or continuous nature.I know very well how delicate these questions of tax policy or social protection are.In my opinion, it is not necessary to standardize all national social protection systems, but it has never been mentioned, but it is simply a matter of ensuring the best conditions for functioning the internal market in a Europe with 30 or 27 countries without a state being able to block the other 26 or 27.Mr MP Maccormick, yes, I confirm that this dialogue will go far beyond the national capitals that he should reach the people where they live where they are rooted.And if I said something else, I would object to myself as a responsible commissioner for regional policy, i.h.One of the most concrete and visible policies that serve to support the employment situation and the quality of life of the people in their region.I often care to say that this policy is not only operated in the sense of the primary goal of cohesion and solidarity among the regions, but also for the fact that people can preserve their roots, soul and their identity where they live.We will therefore conduct this dialogue in the cities and the regions.Mr. Berthu, Helsinki's mandate is clear, and we move in this context.It states that we first and primarily deal with the three basic topics that have remained unsolved in Amsterdam.In addition, there are the related institutional questions and finally the questions that are considered necessary by the Portuguese and French chair in the course of the negotiations.The Commission acts according to its mandate if it believes that it has to complement your statement on a variety of institutional questions in this or that point.I am not yet sure whether this will be the case with Article 7, but if we do it, then not only in response to a special situation, which is so serious that the fourteen governments of the Union were determined together, but we will also consider the future in general.Everything that can be done to the final securing of the community of values ​​that we have together since the founding fathers built the Union in 1957 and formed earlier since the end of the Second World War has been useful.I am sure, Mr. Berthu, that we - you and I - can at least find a match on this basis.	de
"The answer that was given to us was always the same: ""We cannot free it, it is a war criminal.""Amid the emotion, pain, ardor, of the commitments, it was not possible to break the infernal circle of blood and revenge.If we want to help the Cambodians in the task of reconciliation they have initiated, it is necessary to judge and condemn those responsible at the highest level and exonerate the simple executors and all those who, obliged or not, were dragged after them.I expect the creation of a court, whose impartiality will be guaranteed by the United Nations, the trial and conviction of Ta Mok and its main officers.It will be the only way, for the Cambodians, to forgive those who were simple followers and, thus, to get a lasting peace.Mr. President, this week it has been announced that two leading newspapers of the Cambodian opposition have been threatened to have insulted the king and prime minister.These are two newspapers that actively support the opposition politician Sam Rengie.A procedure has begun against Sam Rengie to raise his parliamentary immunity in order to process him by betrayal.The reason for this is that in the speech he pronounced on the occasion of the new millennium he dared to raise the problem of the succession of King Sihanuk, demanding that the procedure to be followed be clarified in case he dies.Last March a group of men with a military uniform murdered one of Sam Rengie's party members in Kandal province.In September they arrested two members of their party claiming that they had been involved in an attack with a missile against the prime minister.Understand that it is the only Cambodian party that does not have a military wing.In October one of the parliamentarians of this same party was kidnapped by uniformed men who were released in exchange for a rescue.The intimidation pattern is obvious.More things happen in Cambodia.The prisoners, the Army and the Police are implicated in the trafficking of women and children and abusive use of preventive detention are made.All this is the order of the day.However, the most serious thing is that the government resists that the Red Jamers be prosecuted by an international court.It is true that the civil war in Cambodia is over and that political tensions have decreased.However, we are seriously concerned about the treatment that the political opposition is receiving.If this situation persists inexorably, it will have consequences for the relations between the union and Cambodia.Mr. President, within the framework of international law, a new doctrine is being molded, according to which no state can treat its citizens or the people resident in their territory, nor the principle of national sovereignty is a pretext that avoids the intervention of other countries in cases of serious violations of human rights, even if the State management is legitimate or even democratically chosen."	es
As for the internal reform, you know the commitment made by my committee on this point from the first day.I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if this deep and total internal reform is not carried out, if the Commission is not more effective in all sectors, starting with that where we have accumulated the most delay, that of external aid.Providing quick help where it is necessary makes it possible to save human lives;Providing late help can sometimes be worse than not to provide at all.When I speak of external aid, I think first of the Balkans, where we record some encouraging signs due to the commitment of our officials in the field, an extraordinary commitment in view of the organizational problems encountered.I also think of the efforts made by Mr. Kouchner, the stability pact that we energetically support, with absolute dedication, but also of new elements, for example in Croatia, where the situation changed in a few weeks.The European institutions immediately opened the door to a dialogue with this country, they welcomed these changes knowing perfectly well that the problems of Bosnia and especially of Serbia can only be resolved if democracy settles in Serbia.This is the new element that we must help to spread in the Balkans.We must be more effective in this region, we must restore traffic on the Danube.There is no need to provide help to Romania and Bulgaria and prevent these two countries from using their main resource.We have to decontaminate the river.To do this, the environmental commissioner will present specific projects in the coming days to control this serious problem.We have done a lot in the Balkans: our new European reconstruction agency for Kosovo, the Task Force for the Balkans, a new regulation aimed at accelerating procedures.However, we absolutely have to do more.We must liberalize exchanges in the region, as well as exchanges between this region and the European Union.We must contribute to the establishment of infrastructure links that break up secular isolation.We must intensify efforts with a view to construction in these countries of a democratic and pluralist society with institutions, public structures, police forces and the organization of civil society, but above all we must encourage these countries to collaborate in a unitary regional perspective, both political and economic.If we do not do it, we will fail to our duty.Remember the Marshall Plan, its effectiveness has not resulted from the only importance of its resources, it turned out to be even more effective because it forced us, Europeans, to collaborate in a new perspective, to give a new horizon to our policy and our economy.This is what we have to do for the Balkans.Europe must prove - from Balkans to all the rest of the world - its ability to expand the space of security, peace and freedom, its ability to act on the international scene.	fr
And I will point out, before moving on to my question, that what is happening within the framework of the status of civil servants within the Commission, plays a fundamental role in terms of our responsibilities also as employers, because, of course, the staff of the European Parliament work under the same conditions.This will constitute part of the work that we will have to do and I am convinced that you will all want to engage in this process today.Well, I would like to resume two points with Mr. Kinnock, if you allow me.The first concerns the calendar of these important reforms.Mr. Prodi said in his very important opening discourse that he had identified serious problems within the Commission which relates to a level of low morality and to a low motivation, which clearly constitutes a major concern.We expect a lot from these reforms, both within the Commission and outside.And if we want to move forward, I would say that the reforms concerning the staff, early proofs of a change of culture, that a strengthening of powers and that a motivation of the staff must be done as soon as possible.And according to the original proposals - and I have the impression that the news will not differ in the matter - the general reform of the status of civil servants would not have been accomplished in 2002. Besides, some of the fundamental elements would not have been introduced in 2001. I think that the delay is too long, and we must really advance much faster than that.The second point I want to raise concerns information technology.Have you really taken into account the changes that the new information technology will bring to the level of staff structure, as they will be fundamental for the new management of these reforms.In terms of the second part of Mr. Harbor's question, he will see, during this year, that we will show, with greater precision, in what way the broader application of information technologies will facilitate change, not only in terms of personnel practices and conditions of staff but also in terms of the operation of the Commission, as the President has briefly underlined.Let me thank Mr. Harbor for his energetic commitment in favor of the subject for which he is rapporteur and to answer him by saying that we firmly believe that the moral, motivation and professional commitment of commission officials, already very high, will be improved by the introduction of global training, by the allocation of responsibilities, by improving management and by a number of other changes that will be introduced.Cultures are structural and systems products, and structures and systems have become old.By renovating them, sometimes in a very radical way, will help us those who, in the Commission, resolutely seek the European ideal and whose capacities are very high, to make talents expressing and what they manifest as never before they have done.I would like to make a last remark in response to Mr. Harbor.	fr
Finally, I would like to add that I had my doubts about government formation in Austria last week.However, I have no concerns to discuss and criticize Austrian asylum policy.I hope the commitment of this plenary will be just as large.Mr. President, during the last financial foresight for the period 1994-1999 with a total of 13 different initiatives, was of great importance to the cross-border Interreg II initiative.In my opinion, the fact that the Interreg initiative is the upcoming round of the structural funds in the period 2000-2006 is a clear evidence of the rank that the EU member states attach to it.The Interreg-I program in the period 1989-1993 and the Interreg-II program in 1994-1999 have proven to be an outstanding success in terms of approaching social and economic development between neighboring Member States.In my homeland, the border counties in the northwest of Ireland, I have been able to pursue the important role that Interreg I and II have played in recent years, so I look forward to Interreg III with great joy.The Commission approved the Interreg III program of £ 67 million, which are to be used to continue the development of economic projects for municipalities on both sides of the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.The European Union played a major role in the development of these border regions in the many years.With its contribution of 80 million pounds for the International Fund for Ireland, the EU is the largest sole proprietor, and it also contributes 75 % of the funds for the program to support peace and reconciliation.All in all, Interreg, the International Fund for Ireland and the program for peace and reconciliation, have made a decisive contribution to promoting the peace process.Mr President, I will limit myself to some critical aspects with my explanations of Interreg, also to adhere to the speaking time at your disposal.We supported the new edition of this program and the expansion of the intervention areas, not only in the area of ​​cross -border cooperation, but also in the context of transnational and interregional cooperation.Regardless of this, we are aware that most of the resources - between 50 and 80 % - will be reserved for cross -border cooperation, i.e. the orientation A of the Interreg III program;That is why we are still of the opinion that the decision to consolidate the current cooperation spaces in this direction with regard to the selection of the eligible regions is wrong and inconsistent.We hope and wish that the Commission would go into the point of view of the position of Parliament and not only pay it to formal recognition.The cross -border cooperation continues to refer almost exclusively to the mainland borders, and in the cases where exceptions to the maritime boundaries have been made, the corresponding decisions are not transparent and often have to do with the fact that compensation to other fields of community policies should be created.The island areas that live in a regional situation that is inevitably connected to pure sea boundaries are particularly disadvantaged.This corresponds to continued discrimination, in the context of which the content of Article 158 of the contract, where the islands are mentioned in connection with politics to strengthen economic and social cohesion.	de
We understand that collaboration is important, common work by the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - and that the collaboration that exists with the Regional Policy Commission, and specifically with the transport group, is magnificent.The common position includes practically all amendments accepted by the Commission, harmonizes the minimum requirements of the exams of the Security Directors and, in second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, much more realistic than that raised in principle by the Commission, taking into account that we have been discussing this issue for several years.Bhisimly, I also want to thank the intervention of the different deputies and tell their laddies that security is a priority of the commission in the field of transport.And as Mr. Simpson has said very well, the process can never be taken for granted or culminated.The process of increasing margins, transportation guarantees is a process that must be improved day by day.In that sense, I also want to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, to which Messrs. Rack and Swoboda have referred, which, undoubtedly, in the case of Austria, it is a very sensitive matter, so you have to make efforts to see how to increase their safety.In one of the great accidents that occurred lately, the merchandise transported was not dangerous.La Margarina and a few kilos of paint that, in principle, did not raise risks, caused a true catastrophe.Therefore, we must see how the demands can be further refined to guarantee a maximum security.Finally, I would like to say that security must be contemplated in all types of transport.This week we will celebrate here a debate to talk about the security of maritime transport, due to the Erika catastrophe, and we will have to discuss, throughout this year, about the objectives, in terms of safety, of air transport.But I mean, lordships, that security is a priority objective of the commission.As I will say in the debate about Erika, we do not wait for there to be a catastrophe to turn over the aspect of security, but we work on it apart from these circumstances, that all they do is show the urgency of an effective response to such problems.I want to reiterate my thanks to all those who have intervened and especially the rapporteur, Mr. Koch.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.Transport of dangerous goods by road In accordance with the agenda, Mr. Koch, on behalf of the Regional Policy Commission, Transport and Tourism, on a proposal of the Board of Directors of the European Parliament and the Council (com (1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083 (COD) (COD) (COD) (COD) (COD) (COD) (COD) (COD), which modifies the directiveon the approximation of the legislation of the Member States with respect to the transport of dangerous goods by road.	es
"I would like to thank Commissioner Patten who, despite the short notice, wanted to participate in today's debate and answer our questions about Mozambique's extremely critical situation.As other speakers said, the television images of the Clean Valley left us absolutely breathless: we saw children who lost their parents and families defenseless and without hopes that have lost everything.As has already been said, all this was predictable and had been foreseen, and the fact that the response to the catastrophe is slow and inadequate - shamefully slow and inadequate - should make us understand that a big investment must be made in preparing a response to similar catastrophes.As the commissioner said, a mechanism and a prompt intervention force must be implemented which, in situations like this, allow us to face crises that have only occurred because we had not applied the appropriate strategies or had not made the necessary logistical preparations.This morning there were seven helicopters in flight, all concentrated in the Gaza region alone.The Save river also presents strong risk of flooding, but nobody has yet gone to the scene.85 percent of the rescue operations takes place within the area that can be reached in less than an hour from MapuTu and therefore are unable to evaluate the scope of the problem.I would like to point out to the commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what Echo is doing.Most of us would not want to stop at 3 million euros;It will take much more, and I hope that the commissioner can return here with the promise to allocate more funds and with an initiative that can coordinate our efforts.Clearly it will be necessary to create a large air bridge.As has been said, there is a need for a large amount of food, equipment for the purification of water, curtains and blankets.I wonder if we are ready to deal with the next rescue and reconstruction phase that has been discussed, since this phase will also need huge resources.Are we ready to provide the indispensable financial coverage?Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world, but it is also one of those who have achieved the most results in Africa.The country has worked hard in favor of economic growth, the reduction of poverty and democracy, despite the enormous pressure of the public debt.Mozambique is a model country, but will have a period of great difficulties in all probability due to what he has suffered.Now we should try to understand how much the catastrophe to Mozambique will cost, and this will depend only on the quantity and quality of the international aid that will be provided.Thank you very much, honorable Kinnock.Mr Nogueira, we take note of his interest and concern for this question, but his group is not registered to intervene to the discussion and I landed on the regulation.The discussion is closed.Economy of the Union (1999) The agenda bears the discussion on the report (A5-0041/2000), presented by the Honorable Katifortis on behalf of the Commission for economic and monetary problems on the Commission document entitled ""Revision of the Economy of the European Union in 1999"" (C5-0081/2000-2000/2046 (COS)).The Commission report presents an assessment of the current European economic situation that it finds promising, in particular in relation to the recent recovery of economic growth which should lead to the reduction of unemployment to 8 percent by 2001."	it
It is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation, and it should be recognized that the performance of NATO and the European Union has been wrong to take that measure.Mr. Minister has spoken, rightly -I am agreeing to Belgrade's faults, but it must also be remembered that the secret services of the US, Germany, France, Italy, Great Brittany have been supplying weapons and money to the UCK, to a mafia, to contribute to the fact that there were problems in that area.Therefore, we are all to blame.I wanted to ask you a complementary question about its global context.Don't you think that it would be beneficial to lift Serbia so that there were greater economic normality in the area and Kosovo also benefited as a province of Serbia?Mr. President, I am not a friend of Milosevic or his government, but I feel very deep doubts about the legitimacy of NATO's action against Yugoslavia because of Kosovo, both for the lack of authority of the United Nations Security Council and because I believe that what happened could have been avoided if they had not imposed unacceptable terms for Serbian sovereignty in Rambouilt.The current situation of Kosovo, which currently has been ethnically refined from Serbs and Romani, corroborates what I have said.I think that the least that NATO should do is recognize its fault for the deliberate attack against the Belgrade TV tower, in which more than 20 civil journalists perished, and that constitutes a serious moral heel for the development of the war and now opens the embarrassing possibility that our western leaders are accused of war crimes.Honor, we do not have, at the level of the positions adopted by the European Union, an interpretation and a selective analysis of the military objectives, in particular of the initiatives adopted against a certain type of infrastructure that served as support to the political and propaganda system of Mr. Milosevic.Therefore, I cannot tell him whether or not we agreed with a specific action carried out by NATO.It is part of a global plan for which we agree.Some of these actions could be debatable and some were considered unfortunate even by NATO itself and others will be justifiable actions for tactical reasons, in the sense of preventing Mr. Milosevic from maintaining their internal propaganda campaign.In any case, I, in the name of the Council, do not want to make any value judgment regarding some concrete action carried out by NATO in the military sphere.Mr. President in the exercise of the Council, since I know the history of the Balkans, I would like to remind you that for many decades the peoples of Yugoslavia lived peacefully.The destabilization began, approximately a decade ago, with the dissolution of Yugoslavia, a process in which the European Union played a determining role.The crime of Yugoslavia consisted of being the only country of Balkans who had not requested its entry in NATO or the European Union.And so, now what was still standing, after the aerial incursions, is destroyed by the supposedly unarmed Uçk, in the noses of the KFOR, whose role of occupation force becomes increasingly evident.	es
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether this principle is actually applicable and whether we will receive any compensation from the people mentioned.The second question refers to the announced commission of the Commission on Environmental Liability, which is intended to ensure that the pollutant principle will apply in the future and that we have better opportunities to implement European environmental legislation accordingly.The white book admits that the cause can only be held responsible if it has been determined if the damage is quantifiable and a causal connection is undoubtedly proven.The accident of Erika is an example par excellence;This is exactly what the white book is about here.It can therefore become a benchmark of how to deal with problems of this kind in the future.The proposed guideline provides for a strict liability for damage that goes back to dangerous activities regulated by the EU.My concern goes there, and maybe the commissioner can comment on whether the white book for environmental liability is actually the right means of dealing with problems of the size of the Erika shipwreck.If it actually does justice to the requirements or will continue to get away from ship Shavaria on the high seas without having to pay for the damage.Mr President, we would like to express our sympathy and solidarity to the people and regions affected by the disaster.But good intentions alone are not sufficient, but a replacement must be made for the damage and the failures must be compensated for, both in terms of restoration of the environment as well as the mussel breeding facilities and the fishing equipment.We welcome that the Lord spoke of the fact that it is necessary to act and compensate for it quickly and retrospectively.We also complain about the careless control of the ships and support the creation of a European coast guard and in particular the demand for stricter legal regulations and for ships with a double outer skin.We continue to denounce the practice of pleasure flags in both merchant ships and fishing vehicles.Furthermore, we are shocked by the fact that the cargo was strongly carcinogenic due to the content of polyaromatic hydrocarbons of over 1000 ppm.This means that under the 15,000 tons of oil that came into the sea were 15 tons of highly toxic products.This is unacceptable.We also learned it too late, so that medical check -ups are now particularly necessary for the volunteers who have worked with great commitment to restoring the environment.In our opinion, the prevention against such risks and scientific research to prevent and eliminate damage must apply special attention.Numerous suggestions have been made that should be checked.Solutions for disaster cases cannot be found at the last moment, but it must mainly be traded in advance.Mr President, over two months after Erika's accident, the already cleaned coastal sections are repeatedly dirty.I would like to express my solidarity with the victims again and appreciate the high commitment of the volunteers and specialists who are still working on cleaning the dirty beaches.As a result of the mobilization on site, to whose mouthpiece our house made a debate and the assumption of a resolution on February 20, the announcement of a first package of measure has occurred.	de
In 80 percent of the market subject to free competition, the price has dropped.This shows that competition really works.My conclusion is: Get competition in the other 20 percent!In the light of these facts, they are increasingly demanding ... (the speaker is interrupted by Markov) believed that it was I who had the word.Possibly we can discuss this a little later.However, I find that it is precisely as I have stated, that is, that the price has dropped in the sectors where there is competition and has risen where there is monopoly.This is how it works almost always.Therefore, I recommend the formation of a commission that takes the necessary initiatives and occupies that there is competition in the postal sector.Mr. Markov, you will have a few minutes within five or six minutes.I would appreciate that he did not interrupt his colleagues.Mr. President, there is a mystery.What happened to the directive on postal services that was approved on December 15, 1997?The Commission has maintained overwhelming silence for the time since then until the current moment.I feel the Monti commissioner who is here today.I have a lot of esteem.He is one of the most diligent and workers commissioners.I am not able to say the same of some of his colleagues.There has not been, during this time, true progress in the directive on postal services.Commissioner Monti said that the organization and redistribution of functions are partly due.This was not done until recently.For more than a year the former commission could have worked something on the subject.The truth is that we have not advanced much.However, and since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like to transmit a message to Commissioner Bolkestin telling him what the directive about postal services was about.It was a gradual liberalization;It was a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price;He tried to make direct mail and cross -border mail remain in the reserved sector.These issues were fundamental in that report and should continue to be in any future directive.The postal service is not just for Christmas.It is for a lifetime.In the Scotland area of ​​which I proceed, it is much more than a simple postal service.It is a means of keeping communities together.The postal service is also the bus service.Postal service is also social service.The postal service is also the doctor.If we let the postal services derive towards complete privatization, then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we vote on tourism - will lose their tourist activity.We will isolate them.Postal services are important.This message must leave here today.And the commission must listen to it.Mr. President, we are supporters of the liberalization of the Postal Services of the Union.This means first of all that customers will have a better service.This is what is intended and this must be the final objective.	es
The Financial Regulation is the legal framework so that the priorities provided in cooperations for Malta and Chipre accession can be launched.I can't start as long as I don't have it because I lack the legal basis.If the lack of coherence that is attributed has something to do with this point, I have to say that this regulation is only a legal framework and nothing else.The fulfillment of this legal framework can be found in the priorities of the accession cooperations that were agreed last year by the Commission and the Council and that now apply in the corresponding programming and management of the projects.I would say that there are many fields in European policy where you can complain about a lack of coherence, but in this case I claim for the commission and the council that we have developed a very clear and coherent policy..(Of) Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, after Mr. Commissioner has exposed us in an extraordinarily coherent way that the lack of coherence was due to the powers of the former president of the Council and his Minister for Europe, could perhaps help us and Mr. Commissioner so that this resolution can be adopted?A great help solution would be if I answered positively to my questions about financial forecasts until 2004 and on category 7 or at least if I said that the Portuguese presidency of the Council intends to compensate for the lack of coherence of then by an effort like the one described, such as Mr. Commissioner, he will also try to be achieved in the commission.Mr. President, I believe that the question raised by the honorable honor and my friend Elmar Brok will be examined by the Council.It seems to me that the criticism made to the previous presidency is not pertinent.I consider that what the previous presidency did in the formulation of financial perspectives was excellent work, regardless of the people who participated in it.In any case, the issue raised is important and we, at the level of the Council, we will not stop supporting the proposals presented by the Commission in that regard.Mr. President of the Council, I have understood;Collega Brok referred to an even older presidency.Mr. President, I have raised Mr. Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the Meda financing instrument he has not answered.I beg you to do it because your response also depends the voting behavior on various amendments that have been presented to us.Dear Mr. Poos, I beg you.Precisely in the place where you have asked me the question there was a dark appearance.In the case of Meda, the situation is in such a way that Malta and Chipre can participate in the supraregional programs, but not in the specific programs of the countries because the income is too high.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Verheugen.The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday.	es
It should also be emphasized that once again, the commission in fact is the problem of concrete actions in the equal opportunities sector.In conclusion, we are in the presence of a not particularly satisfactory document and, in certain points, disappointing.Berend report (A5-0107/1999) We agree, essentially, with the assessment and considerations of the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation, and the development of the regions of the European Union.We will therefore limit ourselves to emphasizing certain aspects only.First, as the Commission itself says, the fact that the per capita GDP of certain poorest regions has increased sharply between 1991 and 1996 is to a large extent to the inclusion of the new German Länder in the calculations of the community average, from the first year.This fact is obviously at the origin of a significant reduction in the level of the GDP per capita of the Union.Then, it is particularly important for us to note that the recovery of certain regions - where it took place - was accompanied by a minimum increase in employment, which therefore requires new development strategies, with a major concern for this area.This situation contradicts the slowness of the adoption of employment promotion measures exclusively reserved for the internal policy of the Member States, as the report does.Finally, but this is not the least important aspect, we will mention the rapporteur's proposal to include in the future in this type of report, among other aspects, an analysis of the interregional evolution of cohesion in each state.The multiplicity of situations and the differentiated evolution from one region to another, within the same state, impose an in -depth evaluation of this question so as to allow and guarantee the correction of regional policies (and others) in order to ensure cohesion also inside each Member State.Given the employment situation in the community and the ambition displayed by the European Union to resolutely attack unemployment, the analysis of the concentrations made by the Commission should take into account other elements than competition.I want for example the restructuring of the ABB-Alsthom Power company, including a large delegation of employees from all over Europe is present today in Strasbourg.The management of Abb-Alsthom Power, which results from a merger carried out in June 1999, announced a restructuring with already prospects for job cuts in a number of countries.This harmful situation for employment poses many questions, in particular on the information given to the European works council which has existed since 1996. This implies updating and strengthening the community directive on European works councils.This also implies control of concentrations which takes into account employment, the environment and consumers.The report of the Economic and Monetary Commission being insufficient from this point of view, I abstained.By claiming to apply the principle of subsidiarity at the level of the European competition policy, the Commission decentralizes for the benefit of the national authorities and courts the responsibility for decisions and abuse of dominant position compared to the business agreements which create distortions on the market, although the questions of concentration of companies and state aid remain in the notification regime.	fr
The European Union and its Member States must set an example and contribute an important part of these funds.In this way we would not only place the United States in a embarrassing situation in regard to fulfilling their financial responsibilities regarding the financing of the United Nations, but also demonstrating that our commitment in favor of the defense of human rights is more than simple rhetorical.Mr. President, this debate aims to prepare the next annual session of the United Nations on Human Rights and the action of the Commission and the Council in it.In the first place, let me say that I am very satisfied with what Mr. Patten and the Minister have stated so far, and I think it is fine that both China and Cuba are subject to debate.Cuba continues to be the last dictatorship of South America and that is something that we cannot forget, despite all the sympathies that Cuba arouses in some circles.It is a dictatorship and, therefore, not a democracy.I want to ask for attention in my two minutes for two countries with which I am joined by a special bond.First, Indonesia.Of course, we are very happy that Indonesia has a new government and that Mr. Wahid and Mrs. Sukarnoputri occupy the presidency and vice presidency, respectively.We are also glad that the situation in Timor gradually evolves in good direction.However, I inform you that violence is not yet under control in Las Molucas, a territory that is northern Timor.There have been thousands of dead in the last two years.Tens of thousands of people have fled.The situation is not well controlled.I know that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow there is an important program on Dutch television in which observers are sent, only to precisely examine what happens there, so that, in any case, what is happening is found, also with a view to later, for human rights commissions.My urgent plea is, and it is something that we have collected in the resolutions, which we negotiate the sending of observers to the Molucas.The thousands of dead are already enough, thousands of injured, tens of thousands of refugees.My second country, and I want to be very brief, since Mr. Patten knows it very well, is Burma.It is unacceptable that we do not pronounce on this country.I have the idea that Burma has progressively falling into oblivion.Ten years ago the elected president is under house arrest.Ten years already, that Parliament does not work.Endless parliamentarians have been killed or fled and only a few live in Burma.Hundreds of thousands of refugees have left Burma to Thailand or India and, nevertheless, it seems that attention to that country is no longer paying.I think that this country must be included in the agenda, especially given the change in Indonesia.	es
"It is a fact that a new agreement with the ACP countries has been concluded.In itself it is a positive fact, in particular if we take into account the pressures aimed at ending and that there were even several non -support member states of their continuity.At the time, we will have the opportunity to analyze more deeply the exact terms in which said agreement was established.Now, there is no doubt that European negotiators were more shy and fell short with respect to the proposals that we formulate, even when new and innovative elements appear in the new agreement.And they will have contributed some characteristics of political importance of the new association agreement.That has undoubtedly been the result of a complex negotiation in which the two parties have made substantial concessions, which is true in the case of the European Union, particularly in terms of good administration and trade.But it was above all the result of a strengthening of the ACP group, which manifestly found a new spirit following what happened in Seattle.I want to underline in particular that it seems to be emerging a new way of considering these issues, particularly in terms of trade, so an approach is very necessary in that regard.Finally, it is necessary to go further in the policies to support developing countries.In the financial-presupported plans, at the level of debt, in the support of delicate spheres such as food and humanitarian security or education and health and also those of the environment, investment or access to information and new technologies, as well as in the commercial sphere, simultaneously ensuring a full coherence of development policies with other community policies and also between them and the corresponding ones applied by the Member States.We cannot be content to give continuity to something that has been insufficient and wrong in the past.Mr. President, having heard the commission and the Council today, I have simply had to take a look at my order.Yes, there really appears: ""coherence of the different policies of the union with development policy.""However, we have not heard a single word about it and it seems extremely embarrassing.We have expected a report on coherence for years.It should have been written in writing here and having heard the intervention of Mr. Nielson, it is hard to imagine that I have found very powerful opposing forces in the commission.I know that the commissioner himself maintains points of view as solid as extremely sensible with respect to coherence and I would have liked to hear them here today.Since the common resolution proposal raises some effective mechanisms for guaranteeing coherence, I would like to limit myself within the very little time that I have to mention another, the obligation that the Commission also performs in this regard an assessment of the new legislation that is relevant.And also by the way I want to focus on the catastrophic effect that the EU common agricultural policy has had on developing countries.Poured the sea of ​​beef in Sahel and South Africa, tomato puree in West Africa, powdered milk in Jamaica, it is expected that all examples are well known."	es
How do we implement what is relatively detailed in the contracts for development aid programs?Some MPs, Mr. Ferber and Mr. Cushnahan, talked about the gap between the Sunday speeches and reality.Herr Cashman verwies darauf, daß man Taten nicht durch Worte ersetzen könne, was in gewisser Weise durchaus richtig ist.Of course you can achieve something with words, as Ms. Malmström said.She explained that she received a letter from the Chinese ambassador, an extremely gracious and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country, in which he informed her that she was wrong and the European Parliament with his attitude with regard to the question of human rights in China.I think Ms. Malmström will receive a true flood of letters from the Chinese authorities after her speech.She will then be able to fill an entire file cabinet about the supposedly real situation in China.The view of many non -governmental organizations and many people who admire Chinese civilization, but are concerned about the current events in China, have been given.It is completely right to think about what we can do.In the first speech, Mr. Salafranca mentioned two areas in which, apart from the conference in Geneva, measures are taken.One of these measures has become possible due to the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of the European taxpayers: the budget that is available to us for strengthening human rights, and in which around 100 million euros are provided for the programs falling into my area of ​​responsibility.This money is largely awarded to the non -governmental organizations and are used there to promote human rights and the process of democratization.Together with the parliament, we will discuss how we can best design and align these spending programs to promote human rights in the next few years.There is also the question that Mr. Salafranca pointed out, which unfortunately can no longer be present at the end of this short but useful pronunciation.It is also about our human rights policy in general and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy.Ich möchte das Parlament daran erinnern, daß die Kommission bis Mitte des Jahres umfassend und theoretisch gut begründet darlegen wird, weshalb die Menschenrechte in den Mittelpunkt der Entwicklungspolitik und der Gemeinsamen Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik gestellt werden sollten.This is of the greatest importance, and if I hadn't already been convinced, after today's remarkable speech by Mr. Havel, I would certainly have reached this view.This debate was very useful.I hope there will be other pronunciations like these.I would also welcome to talk about how we can implement these good intentions where it is important, where people are still tortured and raped, and where people still keep their civil rights ahead, which this house, as well as me, is taken for granted.I received 7 decision -making applications in accordance with Article 37 paragraph 2 of the rules of procedure to conclude this declaration.The pronunciation is closed.The vote takes place on Thursday.Cyprus and Malta According to the agenda, the common pronunciation follows:	de
"The question is very important and I would like to know, given that we could talk about ""baby scam"", if the commissioner will watch that those funds are not removed from Andalusi, so that the funding that the European Union allocates to Andalusia, based on the census criterion, take into account those 400,000 children who do not calculate when it comes to providing them with schools and services.Honorable deputy, I ask everyone, do not take it as a reference to the order, to treat merely community issues.I realize that for Spain they are very important issues on which the opinions diverge ... to Mr. Commissioner I would like to point out that Aznar is the Prime Minister of the Spanish government.Please, can answer the question.Honorable deputy, since I heard that he has it, I hope his voice is strong enough to be heard in Madrid.However, I understood that his considerations were not addressed to me directly.I replied.I worry that the structural funds, in particular those of the objective 1, are attributed where there is a need.We have criteria to apply and we know by indicative how much or could receive each region of Europe.This does not take away - I do not find me behind it, but I am always required to refer to the general regulation - that I must discuss with the national authorities of each country and with the government of each country.It is up to them to proceed with the most objective and fair distribution possible.I still need to know, for this I told you that I am not able to answer today.Since I don't have the answer, I wrote to the Ministry of Economy and Finance on December 14th.By now I am impatient to receive the answer and when I have it, I will transmit it.Deplor that the commissioner was once again involved in an imaginative, and in this case passionate, intervention.I want to remind everyone that in Spain it is not that we are in the electoral period, we are only 25 days after the elections.It is a consolation for the commissioner that the call to the polls is held in 25 days, because probably afterwards he will no longer have to feel this type of question.Instead, I believe it is important to say that Andalusia, in the community area, will receive 50 percent more and that Spain boasts a record in the execution of the structural funds, this means that the distribution is strictly based on the application regulations and is decentralized through the regional development plans and the various Community support paintings.Finally, I would like to ask her a concrete question, Mr. Commissioner: do you consider a change in the application of structural funds or consider the current division criteria to be acceptable?I find this debate exciting.I realize that it has a not exclusively community dimension.Having said that, the idea must be accepted that elections are continuously carried out in all the countries of the Union.I am pleased that in the end the structural funds in Greece, Spain are the subject of discussions.Just ago, in this classroom, we talked about civic debates, of public debates."	it
We are in a historical situation in which negotiations are made with 12 countries or negotiations are taken, and now we are together in a situation in which the growing together in Europe can become reality in a manageable time.But how should the Union be expanded, if not now - d.h.Before the expansion - nails are made with heads?That is why we are a parliamentary group for the government conference.We find them indispensable and urgently and hope that it will indeed produce the results that make an early expansion of the European Union possible.My parliamentary group, Herr Council President, has taken note of the fact that the President of the Council is not satisfied with the current situation.Therefore, they are assured that the Confederal Group of the United European Left / Nordic Greens will also be involved in the fact that the Union is finally doing its homework.It is no more and no less than the future of Europe, and above all it is about a Europe that actually understand citizens as theirs because they can help shape it and because the concerns and needs, the problems and questions they move every day are taken seriously by politics.Politics of the closed doors, advice in the quiet closet, all of this must be part of the past.Therefore, transparency is necessary.I think you as a presidency should ensure that the train does not roll as before and that people are not left behind on the platforms like contract analephables.We consider it indispensable that not only everything is being done in order to comprehensively inform the citizens about the course and the results of the government conference, rather they have to be included directly in the entire reform process.We also find that the political decision -makers must finally jump over their shadows and the citizens have to question in referenders after the end of the government conference whether they agree to how their Europe will develop in the future.In fact, we have a Europe of the citizens, and we indeed have a completely new quality of democratic legitimation of the Union.I want to clearly address another central democracy.As a member of the convent, which has now started his work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I want to say clearly: A solemn proclamation of the Charter is not enough for me and my faction.What will the citizens say if the rights are solemnly announced, but they cannot sue them individually?No, I think that would only deepen the Union's credibility crisis.The low participation in the European elections should be really alarm signal enough.What we need are for every and every visible right, the fundamental rights charta must become legally binding for all people who live in the Union for all their citizens.In the interests of the citizens, we should work together, and I expect the government conference that the decision of Cologne will be revised here at the end of the year.Of course, it is also about efficiency of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 or more Member States.	de
How do you intend to operate now also according to psychological criteria in this region of crisis, guaranteeing the best possible support?Honorable deputy, as I have already said, I understand his concerns.I think that at the current moment and, in particular, in recent months, there have been some positive developments regarding the means of which Mr. Kouchner will be able to have for effective action.I remember that I felt Mr. Kouchner in this regard during the ministerial meeting of the Council of Europe and I believe that many of the concerns expressed on that occasion, on the lack of means to be able to overcome some problems, are today solved, that is, that these means have been provided to him.In particular, there are two essential issues: in the first place, a strengthening of the police - an important element for the protection of civil populations, especially for the protection of certain civil populations - and, second, an increase in the allocations that allows, specifically, the maintenance of some officials with important tasks in the administrative process, if we want to call it, and functional within Kosovo.The question we all have to ask ourselves, honorable deputy - and that is what we did a short time ago in a diplomatic way -, concerns the coherence of the 1244/99 resolution of the Security Council.I know that it is an extremely delicate question, but we must all ask ourselves about the logic inherent in such a resolution and its possibility of implementation.We support the need for full and total implementation of it: however we must examine this resolution - and it is probably something that the United Nations Security Council sooner or later will have to do - in the sense of verifying, as has happened in the past in other areas and in other strategic scenarios worldwide, if determined types of procedures, logic and balances - the same, among other things, that they made that the resolution was approved -What we need to do and that, as a European Union, we are doing is to guarantee Mr. Kouchner all the necessary means.You are right, honorable deputy, we have the obligation towards our citizens to realize regularly and openly whether these means are well used or not.As I recommend, we intend to provide, during the Portuguese presidency, information about it.Mr. President in office for the Council, I completely agree with her.The problem is not Kouchner, but the legal basis on which he works, namely the resolution 1244. Having said that, I think that the responsibility of the Union, that is, yours, but also ours, is to begin to strive to overcome this provisional character of the resolution and to imagine a future scenario for the whole region.I think it is the absence of definition of this scenario that causes or favors the excesses, accidents, the murders of which the honorable Alavanos spoke.Does the Council intend to ask the question of the final statute of Kosovo?If so, he intends to do so within the framework of a general redefinition of the Region, avoiding the maximum of multiplying the micro-states, as some tend to do, and by reuniting the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania?	it
To mention an example, in Ireland we saw the success of the leader I and leader II programs, in the sense of the jobs created thanks to the administration of these programs in the rural areas of Ireland and Europe.Leader III should be made towards the end of this year.The leading program, in essence, offers the public sector, to the private sector and volunteering groups the opportunity to put together their collective talents to create lasting and long -term jobs in small and medium -sized enterprises of rural areas.This is a classic illustration of how the concept of partnership operates and how these programs must be applied on the basis of a widest possible mandate.The European Fund for Peace and Reconciliation has achieved as many successes on the side of the creation of employment in the Irish border counties.Once again it is the active participation of public and private actors and volunteering to demonstrate how certain funds can be used at best to encourage the various local projects aimed at creating jobs in the region.During the next round of structural funds for 2000-2006 other community initiatives will operate such as Equal and Urban.These initiatives must also involve local authorities and communities in the effort to identify the optimal use of European structural funds.The rapporteur mentions the need to follow an integrated approach for the new plans and programs of the structural funds that must promote a decentralized, efficient and composite partnership, based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities.This aspect is very delicate because the main economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be surmounted without a crucial integration between national, local and European funds.This report brings us back to the question of why a regional policy.To fill the regional gaps, of course.But above all, because although the European market guarantees us a priori a better functioning of the economy, it can also be a source of inequality.Jacques Delors used to say that being the myopian market, there is the political need to reduce disparities.It is that phenomenon of solidarity that is the origin of the European social model that we all defend, from which economic and social cohesion was born.Real political objective, exactly like the economy and the monetary, it is implemented in collaboration with the Member States, the local regions and community.The commission, for its part, is in charge of indicating to the Member States, thanks to the directors, the direction to be followed to obtain the desired objectives in the area of ​​programming.For this reason, I will give my support to this report while deploring, for calendar reasons, that the European Parliament has been consulted only late on orientations that should have been aid to the Member States, the Regions and the local community for the programming of objectives 1, 2 and 3. On the other hand, I hope that our assembly also takes into account the opinion of the Commission for the employment and social affairs, which contributes with a whole.of reflections on essential issues such as the fight against social exclusion, support for social economy and the implementation of a strategy for employment.	it
In this area of ​​responsibility, the European Union plays a certain role, but we cannot raise the claim to quickly restore structures that, as the woman correctly said, were not the best even before the military campaign in Kosovo.In addition, it does not seem to me that, Ms. Ms., that the military actions in Kosovo contributed to such massive destruction of the structures of the healthcare system that they have had a direct impact on the situation as we have now experienced.What we are currently experiencing has to do with the dramatic situation of the resettled population, with a number of economic factors and with the level of satisfaction of the elementary needs in healthcare as a result of the general deregulation of the organizational structure of the administration in Kosovo.This central question is based on the entire current situation.If we do not solve the political problem, which has to be done in the United Nations Resolution in question, then there is no solution to the problem of child health and not for other areas of development in this region.I would like to expand the debate in the situation in Mitrovica.There, the international community has rebuilt the hospital with the help of Europe.However, it is in the northern part of the city, so that access to the hospital is extremely difficult for the Kosovo-Albanians.Accordingly, the Kosovo albanians are excluded from any medical help.Since this is also the case in other places in the country, tensions between Kosovo albaniums and Serbs are created, nobody trusts anyone anymore and Albanians do not want to be supplied by Serbs and vice versa.I understand when they say, rightly that the European Union must work in a larger international association.But where will you focus?What will you do to ensure that the Kosovo Albanians can also be treated in a hospital, including that of Mitrovica?Mr, the Mitrovica problem is well known.It is a very specific situation with high -grade tensions between the ethnic groups, which fortunately do not achieve the same danger in other areas of Kosovo.I understand the worries of the MP.However, I would like to tell him that Bernard Kouchner followed a line in this matter, namely to preserve what is based on the United Nations Resolution in question, i.e.h.To try to create prerequisites for multi -ethnic structures that can serve the individual communities, including the various administrative levels.I think that with this question we should not make any premature judgments about the responsibilities because several main actors occur.The location in Mitrovica is deplorable, it is shaped by specific tensions, and I think positive measures for security in this area have been taken in the past few hours.However, I would like to tell you that we have no capacity for police forces - this has to do with the contributions of the Member States - in order to be able to guarantee what we had taken on the measures after the military action, that is, the establishment of mechanisms of cooperation between the individual ethnic groups, which are sufficient and in particular access to the hospital facilities.	de
However, this gives the impression that this growth, which is first and foremost on the performance of the United States, then to the productivity gains of the new economy, the new information and communication technologies, is even driven by the general course of the world despite our handicaps.We know these handicaps well, which urgently need to remedy this, the structural rigidity as well as excessive taxation.However, we do not forget that a new handicap has been added with the common currency.The uniform currency policy and the gradual adaptation of the other policy areas bring additional rigidity for the countries of the euro zone by impecating them that are not necessarily in accordance with their respective structures and economic conditions.This standardization is assessed as positive in the Commission's report.In truth, however, it cannot be ruled out that it leads to a global situation that is anything but optimal.If one also takes into account the strangeness of a unit currency that is not based on a state that in turn relies on a people, it is easy to explain what remains a major mystery in Brussels, the distrust of the markets compared to the euro.Certainly, the weakness of the common currency still had its good at the beginning of 1999 because it favored growth in an unexpected way, but in the long run it cannot be hidden that it is actually the symptom of poor politics and poor functional conditions.President!The present draft decision is controversial.This is hardly surprising with regard to its object.Among economists, there is always no agreement, especially when it comes to the future.The carefree plea of ​​the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems to be an attractive way to combat high unemployment.In reality, however, this is a short -term policy.Even if the rapporteur advocates sustainable growth, this has nothing to do with sustainability.In view of the ecological and demographic developments, we should spur the member states for selective economic growth.More investments, production and consumption only bring prosperity in a short duration.The consumption of scarce raw materials and energy must be reduced noticeably.Further priorities are the repayment of high state debt and the restructuring of the pension systems.If the Member States do not do anything here, even fewer funds for healthcare, education and other important public institutions will be available in the future.A plea for more active state politics makes a rather strange impression.The latest reports of Eurostat on the increasing inflation, which is now 2 %, the permissible maximum value, are not taken into account.If you still want higher government spending, you should not be aware of the next interest rate increase by the European Central Bank for long.What the state can then create in workplaces is re -destroyed by the unfavorable developments, especially for small and medium -sized companies.The high unemployment in the European Union worries us all, especially since the declining tendency does not seem to last.However, a long breath, a structural policy, is required to promote employment.The Member States in particular are responsible for pursuing a good policy.But you have to get enough scope for this.A solidification by impose social convergence criteria and other community guidelines will not contribute to the desired employment growth.	de
And, since today, it is Valentine's Day, as a former mayor of a regional city, I propose that we declared our love towards the European regions that need it.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner Fischler, rural development must and may take into account three problems, namely the maintenance of employment, the protection of landscapes and especially the local culture, because it is important.The quality of life in rural areas can only be preserved permanently if the rural population maintains it.It is enough to observe what is happening in certain alpine regions to realize how much the consequences of the rural exodus are catastrophic.However, I warn you of the risk of transferring an urban culture in rural areas through these programs.We should also avoid creating subsidized structures, which depend on these subsidies eternally.To guarantee this sustainability -this is a term which, by the way, has become very hollow, but we all understand what it implies -, it is necessary to establish, in the countryside, links between, for example, tourism and agriculture.Investments must now have a visionary orientation.It is therefore imperative to associate the young and creative spirits from our campaigns there, because if they desert them, he may no longer pass much.We are not all loudly attached to sprinkling and not more to pilot projects which must, so to speak, have a snowball effect and generate other similar projects.I rather plead in favor of closed circuits.And even if leader I and leader II can have here and there accused certain deficiencies, these two initiatives have surely proven to be positive.I call my colleagues for reflection and their requests to take care not to make an exception for the Nordic countries, but to include mountainous regions, namely the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Sierra Nevada, of which I am from, especially with regard to the number of inhabitants and the density of the population.Mr. President, I would like to talk about the equal report, and in particular the policy of refugees.We had a very lively discussion last week about the constitution of the Austrian government.Today, we are already discussing the policy towards the refugees in the Austrian government coalition, since Ms. Stenzel, who wrote the Equal Report, represents the conservative party in power in Austria, and its policy.The most striking point of his first report was in the desire to limit aid to refugees to the small group of people than is the Geneva Convention, in other words, to those called the refugees subject to quota, or the United Nations refugees.In fact, it is the other refugees, those excluded from the quota and the support of the United Nations who most need help.The Employment and Social Affairs Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that the Equal program should apply to all refugees, on equal conditions.However, part of the employment and social affairs committee defended the proposal and formulations of Ms. Stenzel.This means, in my opinion, that Haider's policy already throws its shadow on this parliament.	fr
This point was postponed to the next March conference.He is still listed on today's agenda.Mr. Swoboda, I confirm what you just said.It is actually a printing error.The agenda, which was distributed, is not decisive because the decision was made to postpone the discussion about this point.Mr President, I would like to point out that this morning I noticed on the way to the plenum that two people smoked in front of the plenary hall.The smell is really disgusting!Please do something, on the other hand!I don't think I can do this, but I agree with them that a form must be found as soon as possible to educate those who do not adhere to the bans we have decided.As far as the flight delays and the resulting problems are concerned, those could merge - honestly, I do not know how many there were - who had difficulties to get to this conference to Strasbourg;Then you could check which problems actually occurred and to what extent.Coherence of the various Union politics With development policy on the agenda, the explanations of the Council and the Commission follow the coherence of the various Union policy with development policy.President!It is a great pleasure for me to turn to this parliament for the first time in the name of the Council Presidency, with which I am very important to the European Parliament, which is undoubtedly approaching the European Parliament when it comes to further shaping development policy at the level of the European Union, because I have the honor to give them an explanation of the coherence of the policy of the European Union in the development area todayto be presented.Of course, I would like to leave it up to the Commission to add some statements that I will have the opportunity to present.First of all, I would like to emphasize that we all find it necessary at the level of the European Union, the extraordinary development and progress that has been carried out in a large part of the living conditions, especially through the technological upswing, which has accelerated in the past few decades and was beneficial to the well -being and the improvement of living conditions broad layers of the world population with the fact thatHave further tightened the Disproportions between some regions and geopolitical rooms on earth.As a result, the stability of the international system is questioned and peace is threatened, from which all of us increase the moral obligation to put our politics as optimally as possible to ensure that we can ensure more stability and balance in the different rooms that form our earth.This results in a reassessment of development policy in the sense of an answer to the globalization of the economic and financial markets.As you have determined, the conditions under which these markets work are very distorted, which naturally requires significant corrections, which in turn - also inevitably - require new options for developmental policy.As a result, we stand on the threshold of a new paradigm for development policy, and this is necessary, as I would like to emphasize that our actions focus on four essential points of view:	de
"But who defines this mission?Who draws the limit from which this public service mission is committed?Our answer is clear: it is not the commission, it is not even the European council or Parliament, it is the people of each member country, through a democratic debate.The fact of wanting to proceed in a different way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions.Mr. President, we are in the first phase of adaptation of Directive 97/67/EC in postal services, and I fear that a new stage of liberalization is translated by an important decrease in public service provision.On the occasion of the audition of Mr. Bolkestein, my colleague Véronique Mathieu had expressed ""that any new proposal, once known, is subject to studies on the effects, so that the consequences of the programming of said liberalization are known before the provisions are adopted.""At what extent are we today?Do we have the result of this study on the effects?As you know, we, deputies of the EDD group, we defend, together with other deputies, rural life, the maintenance of employment, social cohesion in rural areas, cohesion that must be strengthened by a quality public and universal service.I would be able to say, obviously, that the examples that I have been able to verify daily in my country, in my region, deeply, allow a new stage of liberalization to begin without fear.Unfortunately, that's not so.And currently, when mixing the beginning of the entry into force of the European Directive with the law of 35 hours, which is very French, but, in addition, by modifying the criteria of the working time -for example 1,700 objects/hour that must be managed by work position compared to the 1,400 of before -can be verified in our rural areas well a reduction of the opening schedule to the public, or a possible closure of some closure of some post offices.It is an intolerable setback of the public service.I have here the municipal newspaper of my town, where I can read: ""The Chief of Correos communicates to the population that as of January 3, 2000 - therefore, it is very recent - the last collection will take place at 15.45 hours instead of being held at 4:30 p.m., as usual to date.""You can understand, then, why I fear a broader liberalization phase and your measurement package, which will mean a new wave of desertification.As you know, in our country each town has its post office or at least its mailbox, where the mail is collected daily.The mailman is not a simple correspondence distributor, he is also the only social bond with the inhabitants.This also delivers money and even sometimes medications, and makes possible, thus, that people of elderly and geographically isolated can continue to live in their locality.With poorly controlled liberalization of postal services, more postal offices will be closed, invoking that famous profitability, which is often the cause of rural setback."	es
I can say that the commission's report on this matter of state aids to the steel, as they know, does not cover the individual decisions taken in accordance with the exceptional procedure contemplated in article 95 of the CECA Treaty, since they are decisions that transcend to the scope of the code of aid to the steel.Regarding the future provisions in the area of ​​aids to the steel industry that will enter into force as of July 2002, we will take measures so that rigorous regulations continue to be applied, whose need is shared by the same industrial sectors.As soon as we have put our proposal ready in relation to the new rules and chosen the most appropriate legal form, it will be very pleasant to expose our vision.Mr. President, what I take with me after this debate that I greatly appreciate the Parliament, is an intellectual and political support - I think without distinctions - of the European Parliament to the competence policy, a substantial recognition to the work that the commission is doing and a confidence so that I can continue to do it in the future, things that I appreciate very especially.We will continue, especially with the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs, but more generally with Parliament, that inter -institutional dialogue that has been established.In this sense, Mrs. Palacio, I liked their words: we must all row and, if possible, in the same direction.Competition is not an objective, as Mr. Rapkay has precisely observed, but an extraordinarily important instrument of our European construction.As Mr. Von Wogou, competition, in the end at the beginning of the debate, is not something abstract: it is in the interest of citizens, it is the basis of the social market economy.And I would like to add that the competition has had and will continue to have a civil and not only economic value in European construction.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Monti.The joint debate is closed.The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.Criminal Protection of the Financial Interests of the Union in accordance with the agenda, we proceed to the debate of the report (A5-0002/2000), of Mrs. Theato, on behalf of the Budget Control Commission, which contains the recommendations of the Parliament to the Commission on the establishment of a criminal protection of the financial interests of the Union.Mr. President, year after year we have news, especially through the audit reports of the Court of Accounts, the losses of funds of the European Union budget due to waste, poor management, irregularities and even alleged fraud throughout the rule.These anomalies led the Parliament for a long time to consider the project to propose on their own initiative measures aimed at protecting the money from European taxpayers, which ultimately feeds the Budget of the Union.In this context, the fight against fraud, its research, punishment and deterrence deserves special attention.The Constitution of the UCLAF from the operational group and the subsequent creation of the European Office to Fight Fraud, Olaf, were important steps, as well as the regulation that regulates the protection of community financial interests and the controls on the land.	es
"Chinese leaders have no doubts about our position on all these issues and the evolution of the situation in Tibet.We have very clearly expressed our opinion.Although we all know that for many people in China, a long -term real improvement of financial and social and economic freedoms has occurred, there is also a dark side in this context.Those who criticize the proposal to present a resolution argue that at least now with China there is a dialogue on human rights.This is true and potentially useful, even if I have to say - and I told Chinese officials as the presidency did - that the content of our dialogue did not even go close to what we would have liked.As is known, dialogue has allowed us to identify and implement cooperation programs of the European Union in the legal field and in the sphere of human rights.We are very satisfied with this result and I believe that our villages administration program should also contribute to promoting the basic democracy.It is clear that any complex dialogue like that on human rights will be a long -term process, but I would like to be able to focus on major concrete results.The next dialogue in Lisbon, February 25, will be an important test.It will demonstrate whether the dialogue produces results or not.Finally, what are the first measures that we would like to implement?For example, we would like to see China move from the signing of the United Nations Pacts on civil and political rights and social and cultural rights to their effective ratification.I wish we were closest to this step.In light of all this, what must be our attitude this year?I repeat that Member States will have to make a decision.I hope, first of all, that Europe adopts a common position and keeps faith in it, without suppressing any element, that this position is not based on illusions or claims and that it is a common and reasonable position.I know that some argue that we should find a way of pressure for the respect of human rights more effective than the presentation of resolutions.If this is true, then we must at least make an effort of imagination and be more honest with ourselves in seeking this way of making progress.If we want to base our position on the dialogue on human rights, then we must be able to convince you, the community of NGOs and the general public that we are actually carrying out progress.This, in my opinion, is the challenge for the next few weeks.I am grateful to the assembly for the concerns he expressed about human rights in the world and in particular in China.Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.I declare, to move on to the votes, the discussion relating to the joint declaration on the next ""human rights"" session of the UN.Welcome I address a warm welcome to the classroom delegation of the Hong Kong legislative council.(Vivi Applausi) Voting Mr. President, honorable colleagues, after this vote I would like to ask the competent commissioner Byrne if now, after checking the high degree consent within Parliament, he is available to accommodate the amendments."	it
"It would be a great victory if we managed to export this model with the Macedonians to the rest of the West of the Balkans.This exemplary model also applies to regional cooperation.I fully agree with the rapporteur to say that it is necessary to find a balance, that it is necessary to encourage on the one hand regional cooperation and on the other hand, the opening towards Bulgaria and Greece and not isolate the latter.Mr. President, the Commissioner, if we are doing this first step, we will have already made a long way.If we slum it, we will have lost more.Mr. President, allow me first of all to specify that I do not see any problem with the idea of ​​providing support in principle to this very founded report.I simply mean highlighting a question that is missing in my opinion in the report and which presents a big problem for the Macedonians as well as for the effectiveness of the aid, financial or other, brought by the EU.I mean the sanctions taken from Yugoslavia.In order for my words to lend any misunderstanding, I also consider imperative to effectively oppose the Milosevic regime.But, first of all, these sanctions also affect many neighboring states, including Macedonia, in a global and negative way when they are already in a most difficult economic situation.Then, this political strategy on the political level and contravening the essential humanitarian principles has the effect of making the population of Milosevic and those around you.I therefore think that the subject debated today should lead us to demand a rapid judgment of the sanctions policy, as provided for in amendment 10. Mr. President, dear colleagues, it was not necessary to wait for the end of the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after several wars in the territory of the ex-Yugoslavia, with their procession of harmful effects on the stability of the regionBalkans, it is necessary to implement a global and sustainable strategy guaranteeing peace and stability in southeast of Europe.This strategy, which was materialized by the stability pact adopted on June 10, 1999, considers the region of Southeast Europe as an entity, but it recognizes, at the same time, the diversity and the inequality of the development of the different countries that compose it.The contribution of the European Union within the framework of the stability pact, translated into the said ""stabilization process and association"" relates to the development of the regional conception that the EC developed in 1996 for the five countries of the region, that is to say Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the old Yugoslav Republic of Macedia andAlbania, and whose most significant aspect is the establishment of political and economic measures intended to support the Dayton Peace Accords, which should thus contribute to the stability of the region.Consequently, the establishment of completely new bases establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the opening of this country to a prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through a system provided for in the stabilization and association process, constitute an important contribution for the stability of the Balkan region."	fr
"We have to support East Timor with all my might in achieving this goal.Human rights are so important within the parity assembly of AKP-EU that common vice presidents have been appointed who were specifically commissioned to follow the question of human rights carefully and to report on it to the meeting.A number of cases have been addressed, including the use of child soldiers in Sudan, where many children have been deported from neighboring countries.At the beginning of the fifth parliamentary term, I was elected European Copicite, Mr. Clair from Mauritius is the new AKP krepraue.I enter for a number of changes in our meeting, which are particularly necessary after signing the new agreement in May.We need a higher level of equality between our AKP partners and our European members, and the ""we-sie syndrome"" must be overcome.First, I enter for a parity assembly that belongs to the elected members from the AKP countries and no ambassadors or ministers of the respective governments as delegates.This is part of the new agreement.Second, according to the new agreement, regional meetings in the six regions are possible, through which we can work much more specifically in the future.These meetings are subordinate to the parity assembly.A regional debate that was extremely productive has already taken place in the Caribbean in Nassau.Another regional debate is to follow in Abuja in West Africa.I would like to convert the parity assembly in such a way that it is no longer a pure club to discuss, but a workshop in which it is working on improving living conditions for all people in developing countries.I want to give civil society a louder voice.To achieve this, we have to overcome corruption and address this goal directly.We have to reward the states that strive for a responsible state.However, we should also act hard against those states in which corruption is made or in which the pluralistic governments we demand are prevented under constitutional law.I am happy about the development in Zimbabwe.European taxpayers will no longer allow their money to be misappropriated.A wind of change must grasp Africa, new standards must be set and adhered to.Together with the Commission, the parity assembly should take on a leading role in monitoring the legal anchoring of the responsible government, human rights and democracy.I am sure that the elected delegates of the EU and the AKP countries have grown of this task.I ask you to support this report.President!First of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report.The basis of all considerations of development policy must be the attention of human rights and the fight against poverty.If poverty has to be combated, the lowering of the funds for the area of ​​development aid in many Member States and in the EU is in stark contradiction.When financing, the parity assembly must be provided with additional means with a look into the future, which serve to be able to send voting observers at the request of the AKP countries.In the future, the EU will have to orientate itself in the coordination of the development projects on the one hand, and on the other hand, better deny with the individual states in order to work more efficiently and use the means more effectively."	de
"In a debate that took place in the Socialist Party with regard to the Irish process, someone said the following: ""In the end, the solution in Ireland consisted in the fact that all the parts involved have made the following consideration: is it so important to be Irish or English? That each one is what he wants to be, because if Ireland and England are part of the European Union is not worth killingFa, if now on, the national patterns will not work anymore!@ in this case we could ask the same question: is it so important to be Basque or Spanish or European?They will live in this Europe, what's the point of killing themselves for these reasons?He used to say B and probably in Ireland this reflection was assimilated by everyone -: ""But if we are killing at all B and there they were really killing because there were paramilitary bands of all the parts involved -, even in the Basque countries we should ask ourselves this question aloud: what does it matter to be baschi if it is so much?

"Berend Report (A5-0107/1999) We share, essentially, the evaluation and considerations that the speaker formulates regarding the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and the development of the regions of the European Union.Therefore, we just underline some aspects.In the first place, and as the commission says, the fact that the strong progression of GDP per inhabitant of some poorest regions between 1991 and 1996 is largely determined by the inclusion of the new German Länder in the calculations of the community average, from exactly the first of those years, which, evidently, determined a sensitive reduction in the level of GDP per inhabitant of the Union.In addition, we consider particularly important that the recovery in some regions - in which it occurred - was accompanied by a minimum increase in employment, which imposes, consequently, new development strategies, with a lot of level of concern about it.This situation that contradicts the remission of the adoption of employment promotion measures to the exclusive domain of the Member States, as is made in the report.Finally -and it is not unimportant -a reference to the proposal of the rapporteur in the sense that in the future this type of report also includes, and among other aspects, an analysis of the interregional evolution of cohesion in each of the states.The multiplicity of situations and the differentiated evolution that is given from region to region, within the same State, impose, in effect, a deeper evaluation of this issue in order to allow and guarantee corrections in regional (and other) policies with a view to guaranteeing cohesion at the internal level of each of the Member States..(FR) The Berend report offers us an interesting analysis of the situation and economic development of the European Union regions.However, the French delegation of the Union Group for the Europe of the Nations cannot unless disagree with some of the statements it contains.Thus, section 26 ""emphasizes the need to consolidate the budget as a previous condition for the success of the Economic and Monetary Union and the extension of the Union.""In a few times when the Member States are forced to follow a budgetary weight loss diet to meet the convergence criteria, a diet that, on the other hand, have been imposed on their own, the federalists show signs of a very surprising pecuniary gluttony.In a sign of recognition of the failure of the cohesion policy and the EMA, the insufficiency of the results obtained is included in the account of discovered and all rival eloquence to claim more credits, without anyone asking about the effectiveness of the funds used.What can be said of a budget management that consists in establishing an expense objective, instead of a maximum limit of expenses, in searching for projects to spend at all costs the approved credits, instead of granting credits for existing projects?"	es
We must affirm the equality of sexes, the famous Gender mainstreaming, which is one of the less developed issues in the Prodi Commission program.And this means giving priority to the equality of sexes, to the adaptation of the social model and, above all, to a clear struggle against populism in a situation in which our economic and social cohesion is threatened, and that is also something that has to appear as the first priority in the work of the commission.And that it must be complemented with a clear fight against racism and intolerance to be able to affirm in practice the evolution of a union that has become a pole of attraction for the rest of the world and in an immigration zone, given its prosperity and its autumn demography.And this, I think it must be the first objective we have to pursue.In this regard, another element would also add, which is the economic government, with a unique currency -I think it is imposed -and also an issue in which the commission has to move forward.I would like -I would like my group, of course -in relation to the ambitious objectives and, above all, with something important that the commission has done, which is to adopt that extension in the negotiation and integration process, which was clearer in relation to the review of the 2000 agenda. Does the commission think that until the end there will be no review?And the issue of imposition also seems absolutely key.On the governance in general, I think a theoretical reflection can be very interesting.I call attention to one thing: it is dangerous to rethink the entire Government of the European Union from here.I would be clearly in favor of subsidiarity.If we are able to define what our area of ​​the Interior is, it seems to me that it would be very positive.In the rest, I believe that subsidiarity also applies to reflection.Not only should the commission be, it must be our states, our parliaments and our civil society who also reflect on it.Finally, Mrs. President, I would like to make a brief reference to the last objective, which seems absolutely fundamental: the stabilization of the continent and the reinforcement of Europe's role in the world.There I would say that there is an agreement and support in relation to the priority of Europe in the Southeast, with the extension and-I have already indicated-with the integration process and with the reinforcement of the Euromediterranean program and of our capacity for conflict prevention, and with an issue that is spoken very little, which is the North-South challenge.We must not forget Africa, which is the continent absolutely left not only God, but of Europe, nor our important contribution to development cooperation.And finally, an issue in which we are increasingly responsible, as the first world economic and commercial power, which is the voice of the European Union in the world, which means not only an active attitude in relation to the Round of the Millennium.It involves the reform of the United Nations and international financial institutions, in which Europe has enormous responsibility.	es
"In my opinion, the proposal submitted by the Commission must contain elements that allow greater transparency of the working method of several organs, but there is certainly room for improvements at all times.We are ready to check the suggestions made in this context.The question that Jonas Sjöstedt and other MPs asked is of great importance.In Sweden there is the principle of the public that strengthens democracy and has a positive dialogue between citizens, decision -makers and authorities.We are very careful that the EU also takes this path, which is also supported by the Amsterdam contract.A few years ago, the Parliament accepted a report Lööw, which is very important in this context.It was warned that future development would lead to a restriction of the public principle in the Member States.Now we can see that this warning of parliament may have had a certain justification.I would like to ask the advice whether he can understand this warning with a view to the commission's work documents.I listened carefully to the statements of the incumbent Council President for transparency and the government conference.My question now is whether I can conclude from the really interesting comments by Mr. Seixas da Costa on the topics mentioned that the Portuguese presidency undertakes to examine the expansion of the agenda of the government conference and to enter.The problem of ""transparency"" in the working method of the institutions must not be checked only in secret or in connection with any other topics or in certain corridors - although I also know how important corridors are.This requires a special point on the agenda of the government conference, which must therefore be expanded.Mr. MP!The question of transparency is a question that is naturally connected to the organs.This government conference, at least initially, is based on the focus of the more optimal way of working of the organs, whereby in particular is invoiced that we all have, namely that the organs become more democratic, more transparent and efficient.However, all of this, while maintaining a general framework for global acceptance of all solutions that we can find in order to realize these three goals.Obviously, this question of transparency will remain on the European agenda in the long run, and apparently it will be on the agenda of this government conference.I can assure you that the Portuguese presidency will continue to confront the Member States and the representatives in the preparation group of the conference with this question.In this area, she must be able to expect the MEPs of the European Parliament, which are certainly motivated to support this proposal.Then we will check at the ministerial level how we can continue in this process.However, we have to note that we have concluded a contract of Amsterdam that was assumed in May of last year that there is a complex of measures to introduce transparency that is still implemented and the question is whether it would be premature to start a new process in the area of ​​transparency.Despite everything, I think it is a question that must always be the order of the day because there is clearly a certain awareness of the problem on the part of public opinion and because it is associated with the truly necessary responsibility of the European organs and institutions towards the citizens."	de
"Postal services are not only a mail service, but also a social service.For some, the postman is the only person they meet in the arc of the day.We can pay homage to the postmen who, in any climatic condition, walk several kilometers on foot to guarantee their service to everyone.Dismantling the postal service, the service of proximity communication, would be a serious mistake;Furthermore, the equality of all citizens would not be protected.Pursuing profit at any cost means hindering fraternity and social cohesion.Mr. President, I voted in favor of this resolution and I wish to explain the reason.Several speakers recalled that, especially in the mountain municipalities, the only person with whom the elderly have some contact is the postman.I agree on this observation.However, I believe that the pensions of many elderly people will be reduced according to the state budget.In Italy, my country of origin, there are about 200,000 employees and cost about 50 million lire per year per capita, or 25,000 euros.The total cost is therefore equal to around 5 million euros.Moving on to the liberalization of this service, the state budget would free, that is, it would have an excess of about 10 million lire per year for each pensioner, to be allocated to one million pensioners, who would be doubled their pension.This would largely compensate for the sacrifice of not having contacts with the postman.Mr. President, I voted for the resolution on European postal services with much greater satisfaction as it once again proposes the position I have always defended, or the need for a high quality universal service, in particular in the less densely populated regions, the rural areas, and there is one also in my small country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.In these regions, but also in some neighborhoods of large cities, as colleague Melt, post offices and postmen explained a role that I would call almost socio -cultural, which goes beyond the simple distribution of the mail.I know that this service is deficit.It would perhaps be less expensive to make a fax or e -mail service available to houses or villages.In the beginning I am in favor of the abolition of monopolies in the public sector, whether they are water, gas, electricity, telephone, antennas, wired nets and so on.However, liberalization, which has significantly benefited users as regards prices and quality of services, especially in the telephony sector, must stop where the service offer becomes insufficient or disappears, where companies that benefit from liberalization are not profitable.If you cannot oblige them to ensure a service that the state monopoly has guaranteed, in particular thanks to the obligation of a universal service, it is necessary to maintain the public service.I believe that we can afford to maintain a postal service, even if our P&T currently work as companies.It is clear that they have to make an effort to no longer be defined as ""post snail"", even if they cannot reach the speed of the e-mail."	it
We have a special responsibility with regard to the promotion of economic development in this region.The admission of the talks with Syria paved the way for the convening of the multilateral coordination group in Moscow at the end of this month.I will take part in this meeting and hope that we can finally push the negotiations forward again.The European Union plays an important role in peace process, this was underlined by all sides, Palestinians, Israelis, its Arab neighbors and the USA.Our role is also not limited to that of the donor.We have to be ready to act quickly to consolidate peace in this region.But we shouldn't fool ourselves either: a comprehensive peace solution in the Middle East has its price.The Commission is already concerned with the question of how the latest encouraging developments will affect the European Union.We will soon discuss this topic with the parliament and the Council in detail.However, I would like to remind the MPs that the European Union already supports the peace process financially to the process of peace.We are the largest donors in the Palestinians.We also granted Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.With Israel, we have intensified the cooperation in several areas that are of particular interest to the country.The contribution of the community of more than EUR 600 million in the form of grants and loans that was made between 1994 and 1998 received effective support, and the reconstruction of the dilapidated infrastructure in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip was significantly encouraged.The Member States of the European Union together provided a further EUR 860 million in this decisive phase.In this context, I welcome the important steps that the Palestinian Authority recently initiated to improve household transparency.President Arafat will meet with the Council of Ministers next week.This meeting will offer a good opportunity to talk about the need for courageous measures to improve Palestinian administration and to strengthen the rule of law.The Commission is actively involved in these efforts.The Commission also expanded its planned support for the regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs.Last year we provided more than EUR 20 million for these projects.This package included other funds for citizens' initiatives and cross-border cooperation between Israelis and Arabs at non-regulation and expert level.The members are certainly aware that the European Union is the largest donor who supports the efforts to reconcile peoples in the Middle East.In the next phase of the peace process, there will be other potential areas for funding from the community.This includes supporting an agreement for the Golan heights, in which we can promote both security regulations as well as the mining clearance and the reconstruction of communities on the Golan heights.Economic development in Syria requires support so that the transition from a war economy to peacekeeping can succeed.The measures for reconstruction and renovation of the South Libanon, the only region in the Middle East, in which a military conflict still smolder, will also require considerable efforts.	de
"Whoever threatens, in principle, the production of this factory by demanding the reimbursement of aid granted at the time does not only threaten this steelworks but also an employer of this region on which of course depend on small and medium -sized enterprises.It goes without saying that it cannot be the competition policy of the European Union.If we want competition, we must reach this association between the needs of the national economy and the requirements of companies.It is also the only chance to develop in the underdeveloped regions of economic circuits which lead to the social protection of citizens and to the strengthening of purchasing power.In addition, we must without hesitation consider more an economic policy oriented on demand rather than on the supply alone.Mr. President, since my election to the European Parliament in 1994, I have never read a report imbued with as many anti-Irish feelings and hints as the Jonckheer report we debate today.I would like to cite the report verbatim: ""State aid per capita are the highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland, the latter country being clearly in the lead when adding national aid and aid of regional and social community"".I believe that the rapporteur simply plays with the figures.I have difficulty understanding how he can introduce social and regional funds into this mathematical equation.I would like to remind him that the European Union approved the new guidelines for regional aid for the period after 2000, which was only a simple extension of the political objectives intended to complete the internal market within Europe.Regional disparities must be overcome if we want the internal market to be a success and prosperous.I salute the fact that a help of 40 % and that an additional aid of 15 % intended for SMEs for fixed income investments will be authorized in favor of companies set up in regions eligible for objective I in Europe, after the year 2000. I remind Mr. Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies installed in Ireland must still cross two seas to reach the European market.No other Member State is disadvantaged at this point.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, the prohibition of agreements is the CUR itself of a functional legal order in Europe.The Commission considered that the practical implementation of the control of this ban was unsatisfactory: let's say that we approve.But opinions diverge as to the solution.Formally, the commission's proposal does not deviate from the prohibition of agreements but in the end, this proposal is a transition from the prohibition subject to authorization to the authorization subject to prohibition.We go from the principle of prohibition to the principle of abuse.In the company of other colleagues, I resolutely refuse a systemic change of this magnitude.I do not accept that a transposition problem can motivate in practice a modification of the legal order.We modify the law to be executable again: I find that it is unacceptable."	fr
"For all applications for the procedure, I will give the word at the end of the voting lesson.Report (A5-0029/2000) by Mr. Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy on the proposal for a regulation of the Council on the implementation of measures within the framework of the approach strategy for Cyprus and Malta (KOM (1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199 (CNS)).President!I would like to Rügen the absence of the incumbent Council Presidency.I believe that with these questions from the third pillar, with these for the construction of the space of freedom, security and law so important agreements, it is intolerable that the incumbent council presidency is not here today.I would also like to talk about the problem of translations.I just want to give an example, because we don't have time, but this is a case in which the translations are very important because it is very precise legal terms.In the change of change 83 it says in Italian, the original language that ""il minore deve essere assistito da una persona di sua fiducia o da un perito o legal esterno"".This ""legal esterno"" becomes an ""Avocat Neutre"" in the French version, and I don't know what an ""avocat neutre"" is.I think this is a contradiction in termis.But the lawyer disappears completely in the Spanish version, there is no longer a lawyer.Ms. President - you said it several times - that is a very serious problem.In this matter, I believe that the legal and language experts have to do a very meticulously work in order to get a reasonable version.Absolutely, Ms. Palacio Vallelersundi, that's not the first time, and it is indeed very worrying.We will deal with this problem and check all translations.Mrs. President!Before the vote, I just wanted to join Ms. Palacio Vallelersundi's opinion and say that I very much regret the absence of the Council on this debate on such important coordination of the third pillar matters.I want her to express our wish to the Council, Ms. President, that he will be present in the future with such votes.Absolutely;I know very well that the absence of the representatives of the council is not normal, and I will be happy to send it.Change application 31 Ms. President!I would like to add that in the sentence part - I will read it in French, because I have added this version to my hand - s'il est exigé par le droit de l'etat membrere Requérant que la personal donne donne son consentiment the words ""par le droit de l'entat memre requis ou requérant"".(The parliament accepts the draft of the legislative resolution.)

"(The session is interrupted at 11:50 p.m.) Resumption of the session The protocol of yesterday's session was distributed.Are there any objections?(Parliament approves the protocol.) Mr. President!I would like to make a comment on a session of various members of this parliament of all factions that took place last night with the participation of several vice presidents and Quästors as well as in the presence of the architects who built this plenary hall and on which the possibilities were advised on the possibilities of further improvement in our work.At this session we found that there is actually a large window behind the pretty white curtain behind her podium, Mr. President.When the curtain is opened, a wonderful view of the river should apparently be offered, but it was stated that we were explained that this curtain was closed so that they do not sit in the back light and we have a better light during the pronunciation.However, what prevents us from opening the curtain before the start of the debates or at session interruptions in order to be able to get a little in the - free - enjoyment of this supposedly wonderful view?It should be right for me if our plenary hall is enlightened by the brilliance of our pronunciation, but in my opinion it would be even better if real sunlight could illuminate our ""dome of democracy"" from time to time.It seems appropriate to me if you could check the opportunity to open the curtain from time to time with the Saaldieners.Thank you, Mr. colleague.I am grateful for every hint that makes our meeting room more human.I would like to suggest the following: We continue with the session as the room is.I now have it checked whether this is technically easy to make.If so, we do a trial operation for half an hour, what it looks like when the president sits in the back light.OGAW Mr. President, Commissioner, colleagues!I have hope that Parliament is ready today to take decisions to expand and strengthen the financial market in Europe.For me as a new MP in the EP, it was very interesting and instructive to get responsibility for this important matter.I would like to thank you especially for the willingness to compromise my colleagues in the committee, for the open -mindedness of the President and the Presidium in view of the complexity of the question, for good contacts with the Commission, in particular with the Commissioner, as well as with the council and also for the unselfish work of the secretariat of the committee.In the committee there was widespread unity, apart from a point that we hopefully will also achieve a solution.The question of certain organisms for joint systems in securities (OGAW) may seem complicated and technically and politically risky.Some, I think, don't even know what Ogaw means.However, let me state very clearly that this is a matter that really affects the citizens of Europe.It is about how your savings are managed, what options are available, how the competition between the countries works with regard to various forms of savings, what requirements the savers place on the safety and what options for a clever retirement provision that have the citizens of Europe."	de
That said, governing is planning, is also to be responsible, and in this new, imposed context, competition law naturally has an essential role to play.The Commission, in this area, has favored several axes of action: by acting on the structure of the markets by the active pursuit of anti -competitive practices, by refocusing the activity of control of its services to the only cases presenting a manifest community interest and by marking its desire to modernize the law of competition.With regard to state aid, we must ensure that the system is not increased and the introduction of a public register, in which all aid would be recorded, does not seem desirable to us, because this heavy obligation would naturally go against attempts to reduce bureaucratic constraints.Finally, with regard to the modernization of the application of articles 85 and 86 of the treaty, we do not think that a decentralized application necessarily goes in the right direction.Indeed, the Commission not only retains the power to remove a case from the jurisdiction of the national authorities, but it is clearly obliged to the national courts to avoid any conflict with the decisions of the Commission.The national states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission for the respect of the application of rules which they do not have control.In conclusion, I would say that if certain measures go in the right direction, we will naturally remain vigilant in order to avoid a federalist gear which would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the States.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, we express a globally positive judgment on the Committee's White Paper on Competition, in particular with regard to the abolition of the notification and authorization system, but we still have some doubts.Above all, there is the risk that the decentralization of skills at the level of individual states, necessary in many aspects, causes abnormal expansion of competition initiatives and encourages someone to use antitrust not as a final guarantee of the effective and foreseeable functioning of markets, but as an instrument of economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with spontaneous marketsAn instrument serving protectionist visions.In this regard, I believe that we must be inspired by the writings of Von Eieck and certainly of those of the great Italian liberal that was Bruno Leoni, who denounced the risks of an abnormal expansion of anti -competitive policies.The most serious damage to the market, the competition and the free choice of European consumers are still attributable to state interference today in the economy.We know state aid to businesses - we have talked about it - we still feel a strong state presence in the economy - it is enough to think that the Italian treasure controls 15 % of market capitalization - there are the obstacles that central governments and banks pose to merger and acquisition operations.We have often talked in recent weeks about the Vodafone-Mannesmann affair and the rescue of the Holzmann company.	fr
Transfrontier workers, detached and migrants, but also people looking for employment, trainees and students are seen hindered in the exercise of their right to free movement due to the lack of coordination and convergence in the social protection sector.The same phenomenon also manifests itself in the tax sector.To counteract the distortions of the competition and to prevent social dumping, the Commission has developed an approach that seems to me balanced because it follows an intermediate way between harmonization and non -intervention.On the one hand, it makes use of mandatory and binding rules regarding the equality of wages or supplementary pension regimes, resorting, on the other, to incentive programs for the fight against discrimination and social exclusion.Moving from a long series of recommendations, relationships and communications, the Commission has taken a further step forward on the path of convergence, setting clear objectives and also instituting a working group made up of high -level officials.Both proposals have already been implemented by the Council.Now it is therefore a matter of supporting this approach to reach, within reasonable deadlines, to be able to judge with knowledge of the facts if, to what extent and in what way the European Union must proceed with a reorganization of social protection, made inevitable by the expansion, by the world championship, the aging of the population, from the individualization of society and from the transformation of family structures.Denying these transformations means, in fact, to condemn social protection to death.With regard to the Eurosceptics and nationalists I repeat that a social protection regime that remains limited to the borders of a Member State does not deserve the name of social and does not offer effective protection.A dismantling of social protection systems dictated by competitive reasons also affects the role of this system as a productive factor: social protection at lower levels involves a reduction in purchasing power, a lower number of workers in good state of health and less satisfied workers.Eurofanatics I remember that a European social protection regime is neither achievable nor desirable.Both in terms of services and ownership of the rights and in terms of income and subsidies, the differences between the Member States are too large to allow an approval.The way undertaken by the Commission is therefore fully understandable and presents the advantage of clarity: data are collected and experiences are exchanged to come to agree on common objectives, to process well -founded comparative indicators and to issue recommendations.I fully share this setting.I support the Commission's proposal and I hope that in Lisbon it is possible to take a new step forward.Mr. President, the report of the Honorable Andersson contains numerous interesting elements.Unfortunately, however, the most interesting aspect consists in the fact that the report, which should focus on the overall strategy for the modernization of social policy, instead proposes an expansion of traditional social policy, with a greater supranational component in this area.Social policy must be renewed, in order to decrease unemployment in the Member States.Even if the socialists, since there are now so many social democratic governments, speak much less than unemployment than in the past, unemployment still remains high.This is despite a favorable international situation.	it
"The second aspect to be taken into consideration with regard to the coherence of policies is that of development policy in the context of the Union's foreign policy.We know that the Union is experiencing a new dimension of its foreign policy, we know that with the creation of the high representative, the rapid intervention force, the military management center of crises, there is a whole dynamic of affirmation of the European Union that we cannot disdain when we consider the role of development policies and also that there are aspects linked to political dialogue, the taking of positions or common actions, the preparation of common strategiesPreventive diplomacy, to the development of regional capacity for prevention and management of crises.Without doubt all these aspects will not fail to make important contributions to the strengthening of the role of development policies in the context of the European Union foreign policy, with regard to its implementation and development.Let us say that this level also, at the level of the European Union, the supervision of the development policy in the context of foreign policy will certainly have to travel the same path as that taken by the policies of development of many member states, in the context of their respective external policies.Its assertion necessarily implies a strengthening of decision -making mechanisms and institutional structures of PESC means, which allow a better articulation between the instruments of development policy and the instruments of foreign policy.In this context, our conviction is that we must go from a post-colonial paradigm to a truly European paradigm of development policy knowing, as we know, that the development policy has been strongly conditioned in the European context by the policies of certain member states, according to the post-colonial references of the policies of these states.The third aspect that must be considered is that of the European Union policy and the policy of the Member States.The coherence of policies at the European Union level certainly implies a better coordination of the policies of the Member States with the Policy of the European Union in matters of development.If it is not possible to establish better consistency mechanisms between national policies, it will certainly be difficult to reflect on a more coherent framework for European Union policy.The fourth and last aspect that I would like to submit you, always concerning development policies, relates to the role of ""development"" council.We have discussed, in particular in recent months, the role that the ""Development"" Council can have in the context of Union policies.We know that the difference in status between development policies and other policies at the Union is obvious - it is enough to see the difficult conditions in which the communitarization or the non -communitarization of the Fed has been settled - and it can be difficult to admit that we can develop more coherence in the policies of the European Union without a more active and more interventionist role of the ""Development"" Council in the political decision -making which is the caseOther advice, other decisions, which range from the ""Agriculture and Fishing"" council to that of the environment, but in relation to which the ""Development"" council has so far had no possibility of being heard or of intervening."	fr
The United Nations have a peace plan.We should seize this opportunity to end the last colonialist episode that Africa knows.I would also like to talk about the question of migration.I am concerned with the new provisions contained in the partnership agreement that we have concluded with the ACP countries, and which aim to allow more easily to repress, for less clearly established reasons, immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees.I would also really like to see the EU act as a precursor on the issue of patents relating to living organisms.We know today that every four seconds, a human being dies of hunger.Three -quarters of these victims of famine are children under the age of five.This is not due to a lack of food products, but what we have talked about a lot today, namely: increased poverty.Food security and the protection of biological diversity must pass before commercial interests.I am of the opinion that the allocation of patents relating to living organizations would be as the sole objective of controlling the supply of food products worldwide, especially for commercial purposes, and in any other purpose.I would also like to find in this report that the Commission, I hope, will submit to us, some elements on the role of women.In all contexts, and in particular in that of development policy, women seem to be completely absent - or in fact, this is not the case.Mr. President, our debate today highlights the need to discuss the development policy in terms that go much further than those which consist only in fueling the flow of aid.The level of these aids is of course important, and it should be raised for all rich countries.This is particularly necessary to fight poverty and to bet on the development of the capacities of the regions concerned.The level of aid is however only one of the many instruments which strongly influence the evolution of poor countries.A number of my colleagues have today cited areas that are important outside aid, and where contrasts and oppositions between the different sectors of politics have very serious consequences.It was in particular of commercial policy, and agricultural policy and fishing.We could obviously evoke other elements also important: the flow of private investments, cooperation in the fields of research and technology, as well as the way in which the international community deals with various global problems which concern us all, with the financing of the corresponding measures.These problems include climatic issues, that of biodiversity, public health issues, etc.This observation further increases with globalization, this new form of economy that we see spreading.The links between the different areas of politics are further strengthened.What we discuss today in this hemicycle, in my opinion, represents in part, partly the contribution of the EU to the debate on globalization, on the possibilities it offers and the risks it involves, and on the rules of the game which must be put in place so that poor countries find there real chances of development.It is naturally quite essential to study, or to summarize, as requested by Maij-Weggen, the overlaps between the different political areas and the resulting contradictions.I can only ask myself why the commission did not do it more in this regard.	fr
"Mr. President in office for the Council, I would like to congratulate you on having reconciled Europe with the idea that the modernization of the economy and social cohesion are compatible concepts.The preparation of the Lisbon summit has highlighted that in Europe we do not work sufficiently, and that if we want to be the most dynamic region in the world we must not only work more, but to work by having more information and ability to use them.To increase the employment rate and finance social protection systems, we are forced to work a longer period of life and above all we must be able to count on a greater number of women in the world of work, and with better knowledge.We hope that this summit of Lisbon contributes to modifying the current female employment model.I would like to ask you, Mr. President, if it foresees that conclusions will arise from this summit that allow you to take concrete measures and with pre -established times so that there are more women in the world of work, but above all in the new economy of knowledge.Ladies deputies, I am grateful to you and I wish to thank you for the important and excellent contributions that you have given to this discussion on the preparation of the extraordinary summit of Lisbon.I am of the notice that this debate and the participation of Parliament were necessary because I think that a strategic direction is still missing in Europe;And to make this strategic direction possible, an institutional alliance is needed that exceeds natural political divergences.This alliance is, among the other, already fully created thanks to the excellent cooperation of the Commission, directed by Romano Prodi, and his document for the preparation of the Lisbon summit.However, Parliament also must play an essential role.I wish that at the Lisbon summit it was possible not only to agree on a strategy, but also to define a set of concrete measures and an open method of coordination.In this regard, I give you two connected examples, among the other, with everything that has been said here on the concrete measures that I would like to be approved.The first example is that by 2002 all schools and all the training institutes of Europe are connected to the Internet and can, at the same time, take advantage of personnel suitable for providing the indispensable training so that young people who leave the compulsory school and all those who carry out a professional training, unemployed or not, can acquire a kind of ""license"" of the company of information that allows them to use computers and surf the Internet.If this happens, we would then have created the conditions for information technologies to be a factor of social breakage, increased the split between those who are successful and those who do not have it but instead become an important integration carrier, an important means to fight against exclusion.Second example: there was talk of women in the labor market and equal opportunities between men and women in society in general.The concrete measures connected to what I have just called the common goal for families support services and, in particular, to children, constitute a decisive factor for the creation of jobs and, at the same time, make equal opportunities concrete by increasing the participation of women in the job market."	it
"The environmental problems of Europe can never be solved by you alone.Finally, for those who still have doubts for economic reasons: only think about how high the otherwise incurred costs for cleaning our sea would be!There will be the time when we face such requirements.Then we will be grateful if we have done everything in our power to prevent the initiation of oil.President!First of all, I would like to express that nobody doubts the need for a guideline about this problem.It is a serious problem not only for Europe, but for all world oceans, and therefore effective and urgent measures are required.I would like to make it clear that there are a number of universal principles with which we consequently fully match.First, all ports must have the necessary systems for waste treatment.Second, of course, the cause principle applies.I admit that there can be disagreements in the exceptions with regard to ship types and sizes.However, one cannot start a battle that leads to a distortion of competition between the different ports and presents us with the situation that a number of theoretically environmentally political measures to protect the coast or the sea ultimately cause a distortion of the competition between the different ports.Therefore, effective measures must be taken at this point, because if we do not find a suitable solution, this guideline will end up with an absolute failure.It will only bring advantages for some ports to the disadvantage of others, and all of this due to beautiful words about the environment, but they cover a competition between the ports.Logical would be, for example, the definition of the principle of a unit tariff for all ports in Europe, an absolutely the same tariff that would not cause or would have a distortion of competition.Any decision that allows subsidies on the part of the states for the various ports would distort the competition and ultimately be ineffective.President!I share the love of the sea and diving as well as for sailing, and I am convinced that everyone present is about how we will be able to ensure clean seas for today's and future generations.I think the work discussed here today is a big step forward.In this sense, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr. Bouwman, and the entire committee for regional policy, transport and tourism for the meticulous work, which you have done in the course of the debate and in the entire processing of this initiative.As you know, sea pollution fulfills the Commission with very great concern.At the next opportunity, I hope to be able to send you a first package of measures for better control of security on oil tankers, measures that, as I hope, we can bring all together under the impression of the dramatic shipwreck of the ""Erika"";This dramatic circumstance may cause that this time we are able to go beyond certain, very specific interests that are undoubtedly affected by the measures that I will propose in the near future.But even if the accident is the cause of major problems and great disasters, it is a fact that most introductions do not come from accidents, but simply from the habitual, completely ruthless cleaning of the keel rooms through some ships."	de
"We should give greater responsibility to the on -site resources guaranteeing them adequate funding;This would allow you to create a development that would draw fruit from the local activity and continue once the financing phase has also been exhausted.We should make sure that all projects are carried out through the commitment of local actors.Mr. President, thanks to the regulation in question, the European Union has an instrument and has the legal responsibility but also politics to achieve the integration of the environmental dimension in development policy and this evidently presupposes an adequate financial allocation.For this reason, like one of the colleagues who preceded me, I am in favor of amendment no.11 of the speaker.Since the integration of the environmental dimension constitutes a long -term commitment, in principle I would be contrary to set a deadline for the validity of the regulation.However, the arguments according to which a long negotiation with the Council would damage the projects in place and in the implementation phase, they convinced me of the contrary.I also believe that amendment no.9, intended to promote the participation of civil society in the exchange of information and in the implementation of the regulation, is very important, because in my opinion the debate on civil society and good government cannot only politically limit itself to beautiful words, but must translate into concrete political acts.I am equally favorable to the proposal of the rapporteur of a bipartite Committee procedure: the guidelines would be adopted by resorting to a management procedure, while the measures concerning the implementation by resorting to the consultative procedure.We hope to be close to the conclusion of the process started a year ago during the previous legislature.In addition to the importance of the issue itself, the regulation in question and the accompaniment regulation on tropical forests constitute the first regulations regarding collaboration collaboration that have made the subject of the codecision procedure.For many of us this is an interesting learning experience.The previous regulation expired at the end of 1999 and since the beginning of this year the Commission has not been able to take new financial commitments relating to these budget lines, which puts the Commission and the European Union in an increasingly difficult situation.Hence our anxiety to conclude the adoption process in the near future.In this context we supported the informal negotiations between the Prime Minister and the speaker of Parliament in order to reach an acceptable proposal by both sides.The main disagreements concerned the financial amounts of reference, the Committeeology and the duration of the regulation.I want to make a brief comment on each of these points.Two words regarding the financial amount of reference.We accept the compromise proposals presented in amendment no.11. As regards the Committee, our position has always been to defend the consultative procedure rather than the management procedure for the regulation, pursuant to the decision of the Council 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 which states ""should be followed by the management procedure regarding management measures such as those relating to the application of the common agricultural policy and the common fishing policy or the implementation of programs that have relevant budget implications."""	it
"However, if we alone make a diagnosis of the incohernations of our politics, we will be completely frustrated, and the diagnosis will also be negative.As with the strength systems in classical physics, it makes no sense to start politics that inhibit each other.The result of this absurd game is not zero, but would be a negative value that is made up of material, financial and human resources that would be wasted in a useless effort.A negative value that multiplies in politics by the number of results that are not always achieved if a measure canceled the effects intended by another measure.In today's globalized world, this truth comes to light even more.There are also no limits for community policies.Therefore, I am pleased that the Commission and the Council have rediscovered their interest in the coherence of the community policies and that they, together with the complementarity between national politics and community policy and the coordination between the service of the Commission, intend to shape the policy of the development cooperation of the European Union.Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency include the will to integrate coherence into the political, which have a very important impact on developing countries, but without listening to concrete measures in which this coherence is reflected.Both institutions call the large areas in which this concept is to be used.In its long -term orientations, for example, the Commission says that the goal of sustainable development in strong solidarity, based on a trade policy that takes into account the common interests, must be expressed.The Commission refers to a very important area, to trade policy.In parliament, we want to add the policies of development aids to agriculture, fishing, migrations, the position in international financial institutions, foreign policy and joint security as well as the structural adjustment aids.The Council - said Mr. Luis Amado this morning - has spoken out several times about the necessity of coherence - most recently only in November 1999, but also on other occasions, such as ""Development"" from May 1999 and June 1997, but without any concrete results.We agree with what the ""Development"" Council designed - which is very important - and can say little, as someone mentioned beforehand in his contribution.As Parliament, on the other hand, we would like to - as was also said and is required in the resolution - to form the formation of a cross -management working group, to which those responsible for all politics mentioned, suggest the establishment of an observation center of the coherence of the various community policies, which is able to predict the effects of each policy in developing countries and with each other.But the fact is that we want to be realists, and we do not miss the persecution of these goals of coordination, complementary and the most complicated about which we are talking about, the coherence, a more sophisticated policy than we currently have in the European Union.We hope - and we do it - that the wind of the change that the government conference, the reform of the Commission - will also affect development services - will bring us this new election period and the perspectives of the expansion in order to further perfect a more coherent political union."	de
I was delighted to learn, last week, that, in recent years, the Commission pays sustained attention to the concept of subsidiarity and that it refers to it in relations, not only between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Union, the Member States, the Regions and the Cities.I hope that Commissioner Barnier, continuing dialogue in the Europe regions, will develop this idea and learn from what he hears.Mr. Commissioner, I refer to one of your answers to the previous questions where you mention what I call the possibilities of locking the treaty in the face of the risks of deviance, and in particular the diversification of sanctions which can strike a Member State, in application of article 7, for violation of fundamental freedoms.Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this nature, can be part of the mandate of the CIG as it was defined in Helsinki?For my part, I do not have the impression.Do you not fear that such sanctions can slip and serve to punish, not human rights violations, but simple divergences, crimes of opinion or differences in relation to European dominant thought?Yes, Mr. Bonde, we will start this debate with 700 young people in Brussels.It turns out that they will work in the institutions and with the Commission and I think it is a good start for this dialogue with young people who are motivated.Regarding social protection, I confirm that we have made proposals on the scope of the qualified majority or the field of unanimity, without ideology.In your country, Mr. Bonde, as everywhere, I believe that we are attached to the proper functioning of the internal market, to the fairest conditions of competition and traffic for goods and people.And so that's what is our rule.We propose to decide by qualified majority of certain policies or certain measures in tax matters or in terms of social protection, social security, when there is a direct link with the proper functioning of the internal market.Our proposal is not general, it is not systematic.I know the sensitivity of these tax and social protection subjects well.I do not think that all national social protection systems should be put in the same mold, there has never been a question of this, but simply to ensure, in Europe to thirty or twenty-seven countries, the best operating conditions of the domestic market without a state can block the 26 or 27 others.Mr. MPCORMICK, yes, I confirm that this dialogue must go beyond national capitals, that he must go as close as possible to people, where they live, where they have roots, and if I told you something else, I would not be in agreement with myself, as a commissioner in charge of regional policy, that is to say, one of the most concrete, most visible,To the quality of life of people in their region, and you will often hear me that this policy is not only made for the priority objective of cohesion and solidarity between regions, it is also made in addition so that people, where they live, can keep their roots, their traditions, their soul, their identity.	fr
The two presidents rightly did not insert this subject into their file.Everything must remain in its place and have its own priorities.In my opinion, the two highest representatives of Parliament and the Commission were right to look at the most delicate points in the peace process which, as we know, still encounters a lot of difficulties.We absolutely have to support this peace process and the attention we pay to the phenomena denounced in the question of Ms. Morgantini, does not contain prejudices against one or the other of the parties.It reflects our friendly severity, our severity vis-à-vis the friend's friend of Israel so that these illegalities and irregularities are no longer reproduced because they are everyone.From this point of view too, this initiative must be seen as a positive fact, as an initiative that wants to encourage the peace process in the Middle East.Mr. President, the Commissioner, dear colleagues, the trade agreement in force between Israel and the European Community is indeed quite confused.It is also extremely difficult to determine the origin of the products in question.So I also think that it is desirable to quickly clarify this problem.However, we must take into account a whole series of other essential factors.We all agree that the recent resumption of peace negotiations must be encouraged and not hampered.For the moment, the Israelis and the Palestinians are negotiating their future borders intensively.Any attempt emanating from anyone, any third party, and intended to define, even impose, the territorial scope is therefore premature.In my opinion, it is preferable to wait for the result of the trilateral working group relating to the rules of origin which will be set up on the initiative of Israel, the European Commission and the Palestinians.I am delighted that the commissioner shares this opinion.Hopefully this working group will find a provisional solution to the problem in the existing legal framework, without jeopardizing the peace process, because this process must be considered as an absolute priority, especially by the European Community, and Europe cannot put sticks in the wheels.There is, it seems, a remarkable consensus today within the Assembly, but I would like to make some comments.Here in Parliament, trade in the Middle East has always been an extremely sensitive political point.We are important donors but we are unfortunately excluded in terms of policy and political influence for too long in the Middle East and we can contribute positively, as many stakeholders have reported it today, exactly as we did in the case of Northern Ireland.We are important consumers of the products of Israel and the occupied territories, trade being probably our main political force in the region and our encouragement to promote the rule of law is our main asset in our effort to contain the peace agreement.The borders are being closed, sometimes arbitrary, sometimes following a terrorist attack.	fr
According to the system proposed by these directives, the nationals of third countries who wish to move to the United Kingdom under the procedures described, may do so with the service provision card issued by another Member State, thus avoiding border controls in the United Kingdom.If a modification of the current border provisions of the United Kingdom must be produced, these modifications must be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not in Passant through the European legislative process.For this reason we will vote against both proposals.Mr. President, Lord Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur and Mr. Wieland, who have taken the trouble to summarize with a surprising homogeneity the different amendments and interests related to this report.Both proposals play a fundamental role in the transposition of the four key principles that feel the foundations for the internal market of the free provision of services.The new regulations within the framework of the free provision of cross -border services will certainly result in the benefit of the operation of the internal market and the competitiveness and the capacity of action of the companies.The elaboration of the EU services provision card - and in this regard, coincides with Mr. Wieland - must necessarily be governed by strict general conditions, since it helps us prevent possible abuses such as illegal immigration and false contracts.Why do I consider that the directive is absolutely essential?I see three reasons: the economic weight of the national workers of a third state in the EU, the competitiveness of the companies and the proper functioning of the internal market.That is why, on the one hand, I positively value the rigid regulatory framework and, on the other, I ask that the control measures adopted by the Member States are as effective and as simple as possible.Finally I would like to ask the commission a question, since they ask me again and again.Will the board of directors mortgage the negotiations within the framework of adhesion?How do you interpret and explain article 1, given that you play an important role in the face of our country, which limits with numerous new countries, and adhesion negotiations?President, Lord Commissioner, Ladies, businessmen ranged so far with the reality that two of the most important freedoms, and especially the free movement of people and services, could not be applied yet.Indeed, they had to submit to endless bureaucratic procedures of the Member States where they wanted to provide some service.There are approximately thirteen million nationals from third countries residing in European territory.Birth of the idea that the number of businessmen, although no exact figures are known, is probably not scarce.Therefore, so far its access to the entire territory of the Union was not regulated by community law.The two directive proposals submitted here are intended to promote the free movement of services within the internal market through the introduction of a Services Provision Card.	es
"It is an issue that influences the daily life of citizens and is key from the point of view of EU credibility.It must be recognized that the EU has already supported, even that even extraordinarily, the development of the poorest countries.The state in which Portugal and Greece were coming to mind when I drove these countries for the first time, twenty -five years ago.In this sense, those who speak French will surely tell the EU ""Coup de Chapeau"", that is, I take off my hat.It is true that the EU deserves to be discovered before it, but, within countries, the differences between rich regions and poor regions remain too large.What are the consequences of this?People react voting with their feet, that is, leaving in search from bread to another place.Thus, we are forced to build repeatedly, for the same people and in the same country, schools and hospitals, all the infrastructure once again.This is very expensive and also causes very serious social problems.However, most of the population would like to live in their native region, provided they were given opportunities for it, that is, if there was work.We must provide that opportunity.It is a moral obligation of the EU and all of us.I believe that the solution is to clearly stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit.And with an entrepreneurial spirit I do not refer exclusively to the fact of having a company in property, but I understand the expression as a state of the will.I mean the attitude, that the person has the desire to prosper in life, be a worker, owner of a company or official.How is a fair society?It is a society in which any person of humble origin can prosper in life, so that their children can enjoy a more relieved situation.Therefore, the optimal development of the regions is also possible, since citizens do undertake and work, if they are given opportunities for it.Finally, I would say that, in this aspect, we should take an example of the United States, where industriousness has become fashionable and success is a manifestation of personal worth, and not subject to envy, as often happens here in Europe..(Fr) Mr. President, as all the speakers have done, at the time I want to thank Mr. Berend and congratulate him for the quality of this work.As in the case of the previous report, this analysis of sum competence and precision, the recommendations made in it and the observations of their lordships will be very useful to the commission in general and, in particular, to the commissioner in charge of regional policy, at the time we undertake the programming of the loans 2000-2006.For my part, I want to make some observations;First, about the trial formulating the speaker on this sixth periodic report.His honor has underlined quality and even, if I'm not mistaken, he has written that, in relation to the precedents, he constitutes a real improvement.On behalf of all the commission officials and my predecessor, Mrs. Wulf-Mathies, I must tell you that we have been very sensitive to this assembly of the Assembly and your honor personally."	es
"That is not so clear in the German text.I would like to ask that this will be checked again.Otherwise I would like to thank our rapporteur very much.This is a difficult matter, and I hope that we have brought it to it so that we can better deal with it now.Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report.I would like to add that the conciliatory attitude of Ms. Frassoni is a welcomed change as her willingness to make compromises with the other institutions.As for the government conference, Ms. Frassoni represents those who call the French ""Les Pures et Dures"": no compromises, no negotiations with the other institutions, we prefer to block the entire conference rather than deviate from our positions.Nevertheless, Ms. Frassoni is ready to accept the progress that has not been achieved with the original position of Parliament on the question of comitology.I would like to remind you of what is at stake here.The parliament essentially criticized four points of the committee, as was the case before the new decision of the Council and the addition by this interinstitutional agreement.First, the entire system is opaque.It is not transparent, hundreds of committee meetings take place, the agendas are not known, and nobody knows who is sitting in the committees.Here the agreed new system will make a real improvement.We will find out who is represented in the respective committees.We will be informed when the meetings will take place.We will receive the agendas.We will receive the documents that are distributed to the committee members.The whole system will become more open and transparent despite its still complicated nature.So this is at least progress.Our second criticism is that the system has severely restricted the Commission.We say goodbye to the legal act of the European Union, the Commission has the task of implementing it, and then there is a system that hinders the commission and makes it difficult to implement - here in particular the so -called ""contra -fillet"" procedure is to be mentioned, according to which the Council was able to block the Commission even with a simple majority if it himself was not able to show an alternative to the relevant implementation measure.Here too, progress has finally been made.The Council can no longer block implementation measures after the three -month period if there is no qualified majority, i.e. in other words, if a large part of the Member States represented in the Council does not refuse this measure.This is a more sensible system.This is also to be seen as progress.As for our other two criticisms, however, we are less satisfied.On the one hand, we criticize the system that the Commission only monitors, checked or checked, checked, and if they will be controlled by the member states or the Council, and does not take control of the parliament.The legislative, the council and the parliament should be equal.We transfer the commission implementation powers, and then it is only a committee appointed by the council or the Member States that acts as a referee and stop the commission and stop a implementation measure.Parliament does not have powers of the same rank.Such powers should now be transferred to us in the new system."	de
Mr. President, the debate we address today is extraordinarily important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market.In application of the competition principle, the order has developed articles 85 to 94, the policy of competence itself, the review of all those state aid and the tax provisions that could alter the competition.First, the tax provisions of an indirect nature;Recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, the direct provisions, and especially the code of good conduct.This has worked quite well but, as in the famous Casablanca film, time passes and it is necessary to adapt the order that we have applied so far to the new circumstances.In this sense I have observed an important consensus in all interventions.First, it is necessary that, in the design of the order, clear and complete norms are conceived.Probably in this plot of the ordering is more disgusting than in others the existence of confusing norms, of normative gaps or norms that only consecrate indeterminate legal concepts.Much more - as is the case in the second part of this reform - when the application of the order is entrusted to the national authorities.Third, it seems important to me the role that the commission has to play, against the temptation to create independent agencies that would denaturalize the same essence of the commission, to guarantee a uniform application by international organizations.In the fourth and last place -and has already referred to it -the international legal order has changed.We have seen it at the aborted Seattle Conference and we are seeing it at bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world.The competition principle must already have universal application.And we must monitor because the environmental standards, labor standards are met, to avoid dumping in this field, because property rights are scrupulously respected, that state aids are reviewed, which, as has been said here - in many sectors distort the competition and destroy employment within our own home and, in short, because similar conditions are applied that prevents them from helping them to help them.Internal distortions of other countries move to the international terrain through traps in short.Mr. President, dear commissioner, Mr. Monti, in the report of Mr. Jonckheer on state aid to the steel and other sectors there are many good things.In the first place, in this report the determination of the Parliament is reflected to systematically reduce state aid to guarantee the perfect functioning of the internal market.However, many of the conclusions of the report cause serious concern, at least within the scope of our group.For example, the fact that the level and amount of state aid per inhabitant varies considerably in the different Member States is proof of the need for this type of global studies.Aids derived from selfish national interests grant unfair advantages to companies, and this distorts competition and leads, from the point of view of all of Europe, to an ineffective and unprofitable distribution of the limited financial resources.Nor does it give exactly the type of help that is assigned.	es
Water as a human right that should be available free of charge - that sounds very good, but water is not free, just as little as apartments or food.We can only achieve better handling of water and greater economy with effective tax instruments.I would also like to add that I support a tighter schedule as well as a clarification of goals and exceptional criteria for groundwater and human activities, as well as the express naming of radioactive substances.In the course of the pronunciation, several speakers have referred to the importance of information for the public and consultations with the citizens.I can only underline that once.The involvement of the public through good information and a concerting process is decisive for our success, which is also considered in consideration 14.Mr. Bowe should be said that both he and my Scottish employee can continue to approve a glass of scotch whiskey from time to time with a clear conscience!We have received the assessment from the Commission that no regulations are necessary for the extremely low water withdrawal for whiskey production.Now let me comment some areas a little more detailed.Limiting the introduction of pollutants into our waters must be one of the most important goals.I am pleased that Parliament's amendments have concentrated on it.The Commission supports the application for inclusion of the OSPAR regulations in the text.However, we have to stick to their exact content and area of ​​activity.As I said, the goal and the schedule for Ospar are primarily political obligations. A legally binding schedule would not be in accordance with it.Nevertheless, it must be ensured that the Member States and the community are forced to take measures with the help of which the goals set are achieved and the schedules are observed.For these reasons, I welcome the amendments 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88. In contrast, the Commission cannot agree to the change application 19, the definition of the dangerous substances of which deviates from that in OSPAR.The Commission's proposal contains a clear procedure for selecting these substances, which makes an additional definition superfluous.Even if I agree with the content of the change applications 79 and 106, they go beyond the OSPARTIONS and therefore cannot be accepted.In principle, the Commission can also apply for a change application, in which a schedule for the Commission's proposal with regard to the issuing of substances of substances in the priority list is requested.Amendment 59 contains the demand for continuous examination of the priority list.However, this would lead to legal uncertainty regarding the status of this list and therefore cannot be accepted.The request for a guideline list expressed in a change application 60 and 93 and a list of those substances that are only insufficiently available can not be met.Such lists would have an unclear legal status and would not be compatible with the procedure to accept the list of priority.In this context, I would like to emphasize that the OSPAR convention in no way changes the existing community law regarding nitrate emission from agriculture.This framework guideline will therefore have no influence on the Nitrat Directive.	de
It would be an extremely constructive contribution to the discussion now in progress.Finally, in paragraph 6 of the resolution proposal, Parliament recommends the establishment of a working group in order to guarantee cohesion.I think it is only an eventuality, but in this case the competent commissioner in the field of environment I obviously have to be part of the group.We hope this discussion really signs a watershed.The policy conducted so far has consisted too often in giving with one hand to resume with the other.It is a story whose following will be expected with enormous interest by many.Mr. President, Seattle's demonstrators have argued that free trade harms the less advanced countries, that it is a purely selfish interest in rich countries.However, we could consider the rhythm of economic progress and the rhythm of elimination of poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania during 40 or 50 years following their independence.In that case, the theory said that protectionism and public intervention would present jobs and a gradual and painless adaptation of industry allowed.It did not work;Poverty has reached even worse levels.Medicine can have a bitter taste in the short term, but opening the economy of a country to national and foreign competition requires optimal use of resources and leads to a higher tenor and quality of life in the longer period.Isn't this the lesson of the European Union itself, and in particular of the single market?As Commissioner Nielson said, it is an excellent example for those countries and those regions that aspire to greater prosperity.Nonetheless, preaching the benefits of free trade in developing countries is not enough.We must also practice what we preach, guaranteeing ourselves the access to imports from these countries.Parliament's resolution on OMC negotiations supported a policy of free import from the European Union.Eliminate all the obstacles still present for imports, tariff barriers and shares as well as equally important element, non-tariff barriers, as the honorable Maij-Weegen has noted in its intervention, would contribute more than any volume of aid to ensure to developing countries the economic progress that both us and we are hoping for.It is clear that the lack of consistency between development policy and commercial policy diminishes our efforts in the field of development and probably also diminishes the political consideration that developing countries have for Europe and for our beautiful words.Mr. President, in the last two days we have listened to many beautiful words on the need to strengthen the coherence, coordination and effectiveness of the external aid programs of the community and the Member States.There is a sector of relatively limited activities and with enormous public visibility that could serve as a decisive proof of the union's ability to accompany words with actions.I am referring to the persistent tragedy of anti -human terrestrial mines, which represent an obstacle for numerous development programs, for reconstruction following conflicts, and which ruin the lives of the most vulnerable people in some of the poorest areas in the world, in particular in developing countries.	it
They grow, but in terms of GDP.Their competitiveness increases, but the growing wealth does not reach everyone because the number of jobs does not increase and the difference in employment opportunities in the individual regions continues.Mr. Commissioner, read the statement of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and give you priority, because this is the big problem of the citizens.And take into account the requirements for employment when checking, assigning the reserves, because this is ultimately what the structure and cohesion funds require.Mr. President, the guidelines must be designed in such a way that they make the programs of the important five years from 2002 to 2006 sensibly and strengthen their efficiency so that goals such as sustainable development and employment promotion, especially for women and adolescents, are finally reality and the balance between economic and social and environmental policy remains.It is particularly important to cope with the growing problems in cities, the security of employment in rural areas, the promotion of agricultural regions and of course - as provided for in Article 158 of the contract - the granting of the same development opportunities for the islands of the European Union, of course also for the Greek, which make up half of the islands of the Union.The cohesion policy must be further strengthened, because a Europe with a considerable gradient in the level of life between the individual regions is neither credible nor can it exist.President, ladies and gentlemen!I have attentively and listened to her explanations, your job methods and her suggestions in connection with the report by Ms. Schroedter.We all, wife of rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, know the reasons, the appointments, the delays - I come to speak right away.But today we are discussing the report that is available for me and the Commission at the right time, since it is about the guidelines 2000-2006 and we are currently starting with the new regional program planning phase.Ms. Schroedter, you rightly reminded that it is essentially the task of the Member States and the regions to determine your own development priorities.However, due to the co -financing of the programs by the European Union, it is necessary and correct that community priorities are also taken into account, as they are discussed and adopted here in order to promote this community dimension of economic and social cohesion, which many of them have reminded of them.Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly respond to the importance and structure of the guidelines before I have spoken of the comments or the criticism that you, Ms. Schroedter, or you, ladies and gentlemen, have to speak.With regard to the importance and structure of the guidelines, the committee chairman Hatzidaki, the rapporteur and Ms. McCarthy reminded that the guidelines have the purpose of supporting the national and regional bodies in preparing their programming strategy for targets 1, 2 and 3 of the structural funds and their connections to the cohesion fund.The aim is to present the priorities of the Commission, which are based on the experience in the implementation of the programs, as well as the current community policies in connection with the structural measures.	de
"Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, perhaps we should rejoice to be already at the second reading of this directive, but personally I am not too enthusiastic about it because it is a poor quality directive, with many deficiencies and that will put many problems of application.First of all, I believe that this directive is excessively hard, simplistic and reductive.Many other times have not been applied to the water on water;The governments and the commission on many occasions have not been able to impose the discipline as they should have done, however pleasant it is.It is not a question of establishing much more severe legislation.In many cases, in fact, the problems concern the management, the hiring of the commitments due, without transferring the great problems concerning the system of waters to the legislative body, of which complexity is well known.A simplistic directive has been developed.In the same way, countries that have navigable rivers and others where the water is insufficient cannot be considered, the earth opens in great creatures and the temperature reaches 55th and 60th in the sun.I say this because the question is not of our competence, but of the governments and the Commission.In the same way, the problems caused by current destruction and tragedies, such as that of Romania, do not concern the legislative bodies, but the executive bodies and governments.Furthermore, this is not a solidarity directive as it does not take into account the large spaces, the climatic diversity, the desert or arid areas.In this way the common position has been drawn up.The case of water distribution channels is similar.Talking about these canals means talking about distribution of wealth, of solidarity between peoples and among the territories, because the earth, unfortunately, is not perfect and some areas have less than others.Finally, criticized the fact that the directive is not accompanied by an impact study.It is very easy for us to request the impact assessment from others.In environmental issues, however, we should see how many people, how many farmers could be ruined by dealing with their costs.Studies have been conducted that nobody has read.I therefore consider it necessary to establish the execution of impact studies as good political practice.Otherwise our only theory would remain.Mr. President, through the consolidation of existing directives, this framework directive establishes the fundamental principle of a sustainable policy on water resources in the European Union.This is a framework directive on the protection and management of our surface, underground, passing and coastal waters - through the establishment of hydrographic districts at national level or, in the case of Ireland, at a cross -border level.Ireland warmly supports the common position and many of the amendments of the European Parliament.We do not consider acceptable, for example, to wait 25 years for the launch of a law.We have no difficulty in accepting the principle according to which ""those who pollute pays"" in relation to the recovery of costs on the use of water on industrial, commercial and agricultural level.However, I am absolutely convinced that, given that water is life and that drinking clean water is a fundamental right of man, this directive must provide for the free supply of a certain quantity of water in the houses, of a certain altitude by family unit for domestic and health uses."	it
This is the way to successfully manage the change and I hope the Commission will act in this sense.Finally, in the face of the appearance, the rebirth of the xenophobic right in the union, I hope that our institutions together will make their best to concretize article 6 by making use of article 13 to combat discrimination and article 137 to combat exclusion.It is absolutely urgent to proceed on these issues.Aspirations are a beautiful thing, Prodi president;We want the events to follow the facts.Lady President, I hope it is a good wish for the possibility of intervening in conclusion by placing a personal emphasis!Prodi president, in your reform projects she is particularly interested in carrying out a forward -looking employment policy on a European scale.For the economic sector I deal with, fishing, however it involves a change of course.We must achieve this objective by abandoning the system of subsidies typical of the planned economy and move on to a liberal policy, which promotes individual responsibility.We must reduce protection duties to ensure effective relief to the transformation industry companies.At stake they are nothing less than the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the conservation of thousands of jobs in the transformation and highfish industry.It is certainly superfluous that the importance of this economic sector that represents a key factor not only from the point of view of the national economy but also social and this is not only in Germany but at a transnational level in all the coastal regions of Europe.This economic sector is also one of the few fully integrated at European level as regards decision and operational skills.We therefore ask that even in this area the right of codecision can be exercised, as unanimously hoped for.The revision of fishing policy, however, is now imminent: it is expected within a few months, that is, at the beginning of the year 2000. It is therefore all the more disappointing that in this programmatic document there is no mention of this sector.I hope it is simply an oversight!Prodi president, I invite you to keep faith with his promises and implement them!Mrs. President, many speakers of the European Socialism Party Group have already identified the key sectors for which there are gaps in the Commission declaration.However, we have acknowledged that it is an initiative of the executive that we consider innovative and that we welcome with a lot of favor.I would like to focus on one aspect, in addition to those already evoked: cultural diversity in Europe.In the introduction to the declaration, in the section dedicated to the quality of life, its importance is recognized, but in the declaration the intention of the Commission to undertake measures regarding cultural diversity is not mentioned in any way.If we want to be sure to defeat the merchants of fear - those who pursue power by exploiting the anxieties of citizens - we must face the question of how to organize coexistence and how to dispel the negative stereotypes that we rent to each other, within the current borders of the European Union as well as among the candidate countries and, even more so, among those, in other regions of Europe and the world, want to work in Europe.	it
The Commission believes that foreign policy can succeed, provided that exactly who carries the reins is known.And who takes them?The commission together, its president, the Council?The new European Directorate demands strong institutions, you say, while the commission wants to focus at the same time on its fundamental tasks.With the latter we fully agree.It is time for institutions to focus on truly cross -border problems and stop decorating the European car with subtracted powers to national authorities.Several times community values ​​are mentioned in the text.Unfortunately, mention of the corresponding regulations is missing.The question is raised where the norms and values ​​come from.I am convinced that the Bible, the Word of God, is the only pure source of good norms and true values.In the tradition of our part of the world, this concept is an important element that deserves recognition.Mrs. President, I would like to congratulate Mr. Prodi and the Commission for his Government Declaration.The main lines have been very liking.I also share the idea of ​​Mr. Prodi and the commission that there are a series of areas in which more Europe is needed, more integration.Areas such as Security, the World Conference of Commerce, Food Security, and also the new economy, which demand greater action by the European Commission.The challenge will be how to make member states, the Council, the European Parliament, the National Parliaments, the Commission and another series of interlocutors agree.The European Commission will have to play a key role of management in this regard, but this presupposes having clear and realizable objectives.Clearer priorities, specific objectives and, above all, communication with society on what we are doing.These are the key actions and that, taking into account subsidiarity, demands from the Commission concrete measures that we would like to see included in the next program.The fact that fundamental competences are emphasized is something positive and, likewise, it gives me satisfaction that the Commission wants to assume a better and greater role in relation to the design of policies and the adoption of political initiatives.But what it is also to apply, to put into practice the objectives of the Commission.For example, if we consider the telecommunications sector, it is obvious that many directives have been adopted, but we continue to have 15 partial markets and the 15 Member States continue to apply such directives differently.In the application of the directives, the Commission must ensure that the political will also materializes in practice.Regarding foreign policy, Mrs. President, I think the aspiration that the European Union has both political and economic weight on the world scenario.But then I ask myself: from the moment in a true community policy, a crisis prevention system and crisis management at the community level, where are the concrete proposals?	es
The private sector should be more necessary to involve the prospect of financial reality in the financing equation.It is also necessary to avoid that funded projects consist of projects based on income and on a small scale, difficult to follow, and favor the important plans whose repercussions are in most cases visible for all.In this way, we will reduce the need, on which we keep insisting, transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to use unnecessarily, in the long term, the plate of local tax in areas where these projects are located, and the European Parliament will show the importance it attaches to the need for such a reform.If Parliament supports these changes in the report today, these will make us, I think, go to the next phase of the pursuit of the historical objectives for which these funds have been created, namely the aid which must be financially sustainable to the disadvantaged regions of the European Union, which we must bring to a decent standard of living, not by giving them alms but stimulating them.I invite Parliament to support these modifications.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I also want to congratulate the rapporteur for his report, because it was difficult and serious work.There is no doubt that the structural policies and the cohesion policy of the European Union are the basic tools to create the conditions for the development and the reduction of economic and social inequalities in the regions.The latter, despite the advances that have been made, still experience high rates and, in terms of unemployment, inadmissible rates.To better achieve the objectives of these policies, it is essential to coordinate and organize them on the basis of well-developed, clever guidelines, I would say.Let us not forget that these policies, when they are effective, become tangible for the European citizen who benefits, who directly see the improvement of his quality of life.Let us not forget either that it will be necessary to give particular importance to the distant and island regions of the European Union because they suffer from fundamental handicaps in their economic and social development because of their geographical position.Except, of course, if the commission intends to connect them to the European continent by bridges or by tunnels under the sea!Finally, I would like to emphasize that structural policies, as a whole, call for greater flexibility to adapt to developments and thus respond to the new challenges and the chances that are emerging with the advent of a new millennium, for which we all want the best.Mr. President, there is no doubt that Ms. Schroedter's report contains a number of important observations and I congratulate him.But I am of the opinion that we should still worry even more about the orientations and results of the regional policy of the community.To summarize, massive unemployment, appalling, far from fade, is still worsening within the framework of structural policy.The economy and agricultural areas are irreparably affected by the regional policy practiced, with dramatic consequences on employment in the countryside and on the living conditions of farmers, mainly in the South.	fr
"The Commission fully supports the efforts that are provided in this regard, and it is currently studying the question of whether specific measures can be taken in the field of the environment.I must of course tell you how much I appreciate the role that the parliamentary committee of women and equal opportunities play here, and in particular its president.Allow me to recall that at the time of the inauguration of the members of the current commission, each one after the other, was questioned by the commission of women's rights on the way in which he intended to work for gender equality, in his field of particular activity.We intend to closely monitor the activity of each commissioner, and I therefore wanted, in this regard, also warn the other commissioners.Thank you for your answer!I actually draw the conclusion that you approve the need for an action plan - an action plan that aims to involve more women in work carried out in specific environmental fields.Let me also say that the Beijing Declaration pointed out how important it is to have the necessary institutional capacity to integrate the perspective of equality between men and women into any program in terms of environment.Institutions in this area, very often, do not have the knowledge or procedures necessary for the integration of such a perspective in their daily work.Obviously I would like to know if the commissioner is ready to include this idea of ​​equality in environmental policy and the programs that result from it.This is an important question.If we want the whole of our policy to be marked by this concern for gender balance, I think it is essential that high -level officials have the necessary fundamental knowledge..(SV) I understand of course the mainstreaming as a principle which must apply to all of our work.Questions related to gender equality play a very important role in the project which is being developed in my service.I am also ready to commit myself personally, for example by directing seminars on management responsibilities, or on other subjects, to encourage women to take care of new missions within the Commission.If we want to motivate all women civil servants, I think it is very important that this message is transmitted to all levels, from top to bottom or from bottom to top, as we will prefer.It seems to me that the work in terms of environment, in general, is often dominated by women.It is a trend that should be perpetuated, so that women can also obtain positions of responsibility or rise in the hierarchy of the instances that work on the environment.I assert that our action plan reflects this will, but it could certainly be improved.I have some experience in the field of implementation and monitoring of projects.I hope it can be useful.Question nº 43 of (H-0045/00): Subject: Boyne estuary and Drogheda port under the directive concerning the conservation of wild birds, the Boyne estuary was classified among the special protection zones (ZPS) and, because of its international importance, it is currently a question, in the context of the directive concerning the conservation of natural habitats,conservation.However, the Ministry of Navy, the Council of the County of Lurth and the Commercial Company ""Drogheda Corporation"" allowed the construction of a new port in the ZPS and even the elimination of a vase leash in Stegrennan, an area recently added to the ZPS, specially due to the insistence of the Commission."	fr
"Obviously we are waiting for that reform of the Commission, we are waiting for the proposals that the Commission will make and this Parliament must rule on them.Meanwhile, we have to give a vote of confidence to the commission.""Neat.""I will not mention the extension of this report.I do not know if the record of all the resolutions presented here but, of course, of this type of resolutions without a doubt.I do not think there has been a resolution before - and I look that in this Parliament we make complex resolutions - that has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a point.It is also ""confusing.""I will not return to what has been said about the analysis of issues that concern Parliament.That should be the subject of another report and we will have to do so and we need to reflect, but not in this report.And finally, frankly, Mr. President, I will not give examples, but there are many in which the legal language is used with an alarming lack of precision.Therefore, and I summarize -I hope -we are many of us who expect -, Mr. Commissioner Kinnock, his report to really pronounce us for him, which is what the Parliament should do.Mr. President, the scope and neatness of the necessary reform measures proposals allow to deduce the importance of such reform.In view of the events that these efforts have caused, the need becomes particularly manifest.Prodi and Kinnock commissioners aroused even more hopes and expectations with their resounding demonstrations.In the report, the concept of transparency calls particularly attention.Guarantee this is one of our main wishes.The importance of a controllable work cannot stop standing out.But it is not only a bureaucratic reform, but rather a demonstration of goodwill before the citizen.His confidence in EU politics must be recovered.The citizen wishes to exercise their right to quick and open access to the institution and the intelligibility of the provisions.From them he extracts his understanding, and wants a results policy that conceives as a service to a citizen already of legal age whose benefit is on the basis.The success of the reform depends essentially on the commission's own initiative.However, it bothers me to hear today that the Commission now says that it wants to discuss the provisional report with Parliament in an informal way.His speech, Mr. Kinnock, in the Budget Control Commission next Tuesday should not be a unique address street, but as soon as we want and we must collaborate.And it also clashes with my idea of ​​the policy that this week held a press conference before the Parliamentary Control Commission has discussed in detail the report.Mr. Kinnock, I believe that, despite all his personal successes, the commission must do something more to satisfy our justifiably ambitious expectations..(En) I would like to start, so that it is recorded and to illustrate Mrs. Langenhagen, saying that the decision not to appear tomorrow before the plenary and therefore not to be available to give formal answers related to the report has not been mine or the commission - it has been a decision of this Parliament!"	es
It is a conception that I firmly reject because competition is intended for citizens alone.Most companies hate competition.Competition is implemented and managed in the interest of citizens, in their economic interest and for their freedom.Examples of liberalization and competition in air transport and telephone services in Europe show that citizens have benefited.I can only repeat that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to approach all these concerns more competent and detailed next Monday, within the appropriate commission.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner.I received a proposal for resolution1, in accordance with paragraph 5 of article 42 of the regulation, to close this debate.The debate is closed.We are now going to vote.(The Parliament adopts the resolution) Voting explanations We voted in favor of the resolution because this request had been made to us by a union of the French Post which hoped, in the event of a positive vote, an additional period to be able to defend the employees.This does not mean that we approve all the content, which is too vague and leaves aside the bottom.The policy pursued by European institutions and by national governments, in particular French, is a retrograde policy, contrary to both the interests of users, that is to say the vast majority of the population and those of post workers.Postal services must remain public services.All people, whatever the place where they are and whatever their social situation, must have access to it in the same way and under the same conditions.Any idea of ​​profitability must be excluded when it involves organizing the public service and it is not necessary to authorize private companies to garner private profit by monopolizing the activities most beneficiaries of the public service.It has been that La Poste and its equivalents in the different European countries should keep the monopoly of this service.To ensure, on the European Union level, suitable postal services, it is essential to end the policy which consists in removing local post offices, reducing the number of tours and overloading staff.On the contrary, it is necessary that La Poste and more generally all public services hire additional staff.The usefulness of these jobs is indisputable and creating a sufficient number would decrease unemployment in Europe.Mr. President, I personally voted for this resolution, because it is absolutely necessary to debate in the European Parliament of the postal service and get out of the current ambiguity.If we dismantle the public service, it will be very serious, and we want to know the intentions of the Commission.When we are told that we will serve the customer better and at a lower cost, it is obviously false.People who live far from everything will obviously not be served or will then have to pay dearly, and some of them will not have the means.	fr
"To increase the employment rate and finance social security systems we have to work for longer throughout life, and above all have more women who work with greater knowledge.Thus, we hope that this summit of Lisbon contributes to change the current female employment paradigm.I would like to ask, Mr. President, if he expects that this summit will be conclusions that allow to adopt concrete measures and with a calendar so that there are not only more women in the world of work, but also and especially in the new knowledge economy.Ladies and deputies, I would like to thank very deeply the relevant and excellent contributions they have made during this debate to the preparation of our extraordinary summit of Lisbon.I believe that this debate was necessary and that the participation of Parliament was also, because I consider that a strategic direction still lacks in Europe and for this strategic direction to be possible, an institutional alliance that exceeds the natural political divergences is necessary.For the rest, that alliance is already fully specified in the excellent cooperation that the Commission, directed by Romano Prodi, and their document has just provided for the preparation of the Lisbon summit.But it is also convenient for Parliament to play an essential role.I would like Lisbon at the Summit, in addition to agreeing on a strategy, we were able to formulate a set of concrete measures and a coordination method.I would like to give two examples, linked, otherwise, with how much has been discussed about specific measures that I would like to see approved: one of them is that in 2002 all schools and all the training centers in Europe are connected to the Internet and simultaneously have the appropriate staff in order to teach the indispensable training so that young people who leave the basic school and all who have a professional training activity or not""Driving license"" of the information society that allows them to handle computers and navigate online.If so, we will be creating the conditions for information technologies not to be a factor of social rupture, of expansion of the pit between those who triumph and those who fail, but, on the contrary, an important integration vector, an important vector of fighting exclusion.Second example: there has been talk of the participation of women in the labor market and equal opportunities between women and men in society in general.Concrete measures that have to do with what I have recently said regarding a common objective of support for families and, in particular, to children, are a decisive factor to create jobs and simultaneously equal opportunities and a much greater participation of women in the labor market.Concrete measures, yes, but also a method of coordination that allows us in the various dimensions that have been mentioned here to make European institutions and governments adopt common action programs and have quantifiable and verifiable instruments to perform that coordination."	es
It is necessary to thank those who, since the helplessness and lack of means, have fought with courage against the serious effects of this disaster for coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and the fishing resources of Europe.Mr. President, in my status as president of the Regional Policy Commission, Transport and Tourism, I would like to congratulate the Commission, and especially the Commissioner, Mrs. Loyola de Palacio, for its reaction to this event, which has really shaken all of Europe.In the Transportation Commission, I must say, we are prepared to discuss the communication of the Commission on Maritime Security and, of course, we are also prepared to discuss the legal implications that emerge from the examination of this communication.That said, I would like to make some observations: first, the commission has done well to focus its investigation on the responsibilities of the Italian Rina Classification Society, because we have to verify if it applied community law.Over there you must begin our effort.Second, in addition to the responsibilities of the shipowners, it will well be that in cases like this we also purify the responsibilities of the charterers;of the oil companies, for example, that they also have their responsibility in the trigger of ecological disasters such as this, and, of course, in the repair of damages.From there, the reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified.It should not, however, lead us to the guilt of the merchant marine as a whole, which is a very important sector for the economy, given that it covers approximately one third of the transport, and therefore, our reactions must be mesurned;Severas, but tight.I am not at all contrary to studying the modification of community law in the sense of making it more severe, but, like other colleagues, we have to start by applying it, because there is already a legal framework - and it is something that we should not forget at any time - in the field of the European Union.It is a fairly advanced legal framework -at least if compared to what happens in the rest of the world -, and, consequently, member countries, with the supervision of the commission, must undertake the effort to really apply community law.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, I believe that the unfortunate incident of the Erika should, in effect, as has been said here this afternoon, to be the final turning point that marks before and after this type of accidents in the European Union where, since 1967, there have been seventeen accidents of large oil tankers, more than one every two years.The social and economic damage, of which it has already been spoken here today, in terms of both loss of employment and fishery and tourist resources, are of such magnitude that they far justify a determined and forceful action by community institutions.I also, Mrs. curator, I would like to thank her quick response to this incident and the measures that are already being taken and that are underway.And I trust that these measures give room, in a few months, to a clear and forceful legal instrument - a directive, possibly - that ends once and for all with these pirates of the 21st century, which take us all the wealth and beauty of the sea.	es
In addition, the agreements concluded with the EU will lead to an anchoring.They will irrevocably fix economic reforms, as well as the commitments of each party under the agreements will stabilize national and economic reforms.The reasoning behind this new approach is also based on the idea that combining free exchange policies in social development policies will lead to economic growth and a decrease in poverty.Improving the EU commercial regime for all less developed countries, 39 of which are in fact part of the ACP group, is another important aspect.This process will take place over the next five years, so that in 2005, essentially all the products of PVD exporters will have free access to the EU market.Regarding the volume of the next Fed, the EU has made a financial proposal.It is based on the principle aimed at reconciling the need to maintain a substantial level of financial resources in a period when official development aid budgets are limited with the need to increase the efficiency of community aid.Today, around 9.5 billion euros from the previous resources of the Fed are not the subject of any commitment.The EU undertakes to mobilize these remaining balances, in addition to the new FED resources, over a period of 7 years, that is to say before the entry into force of the next financial protocol.This will allow the community to substantially increase the annual flows of commitments and payments during this period.We are therefore not heading, in the coming years, towards a reduced period of activity, but towards a reinforced period of activity.Such a commitment implies an in -depth reform of the procedures and the methods of application on each side.There is a very real link between the reform process within the Commission as such, and our ability to keep our promises on the spot, which constitutes the basis of the agreement with the ACP countries.I come to our development policy.I would say that the global context has completely changed.The marginalization of many economies, increased poverty in the world, the need for better management of environmental interdependence, the destabilizing effects of migration and the disturbing consequences of armed conflicts and pandemics, all these elements constitute major concerns.It is in this moving global context that we must be located.Fortunately, the EU aid assessments offer us a valid tool in order to improve our actions and, so let's hope, to take up the challenges I have just mentioned.Regarding more particularly the contribution made by these assessments, I would mention the following problems: the disadvantages of community policy are too numerous and too vague and that harms consistency.This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to the real inconsistencies that exist between policies and sectoral interests within the Member States.The commission's help regime is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures and institutional mechanisms.Politicians are often more determined by available instruments than by clearly defined policies and priorities.Human resources are too low compared to the volume of the aid that we are supposed to manage.	fr
But we have the impression that this growth, fueled first by the performance of the United States, then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by new technologies of information and communication, is driven by the general march of the world, despite even our disabilities.We know these handicaps well, to which it is necessary to remedy an emergency, the structural rigidities, the excessive compulsory levies.But let's not forget that he has just added another, a new one, with the single currency.Indeed, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies impose on the different countries of the euro zone additional rigidities by imposing behaviors that are not necessarily adapted to their respective structures and conjunctures.This unification is considered positive by the report of the Commission.But, in reality, we cannot exclude that it does not lead to an overall sub-optimal situation.If we add the strangeness of a single currency which is not backed by a state, itself backed by a people, it is easily explained what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the distrust of the markets towards the Euro.Admittedly, the weakness of the single currency was able to be well received at first in 1999, since it favored growth in an unexpected manner, but one cannot eternally hide that it is actually the symptom of bad politicians and bad operating conditions.Mr. President, this draft resolution is disputed, which is hardly surprising given the subject which is dealt with there.Economists are not so unanimous, especially when it comes to the future.The rapporteur's carefree advocacy for greater economic growth seems to be an attractive way of fighting high unemployment.But in reality, it is short -term policy.He also campaigns for stable growth, but that has nothing to do with stability.Given the ecological and demographic developments, we should precisely encourage Member States to selective economic growth.A larger number of investments as well as production and consumption provide only short -term prosperity.The consumption of rare raw materials and energy must decrease significantly.Other priorities are the damping of high public debts and the restructuring of pension systems.If the Member States do nothing in this regard, there will be even less means for health care, education and other important public services in the future.A plea for more active public management is particularly well received.The latest Eurostat reports on ascending inflation, which now amounts to 2 % (the maximum authorized value), are not taken into account.Anyone who wishes more important public spending will hardly have to wait for the next increase in the interest rate of the European Central Bank.The jobs that the authorities can create are therefore reduced to nothing due to unfavorable developments, especially for small and medium -sized enterprises.The high unemployment rate within the European Union worries us all, especially since the downward trend does not seem to be maintained.	fr
"I think it is really the preference option to include this country with a peace solution in Cyprus in the European Union.Herring Council President, Commissioner!According to the Greece Communist Party, the main problem of Cyprus does not exist in its accession to the European Union, but in the now 26 -year -old occupation of 40 % of the Cyprical territory by Turkey.The future of the Cyprical people lies in the unity of this small country, regardless of the ethnic origin of every Cypriot.The only acceptable and promising solution, which does not allow a handling for foreign interventions such as those that have caused all problems of the past fifty years, is a united and federative Cyprus, as is also intended in the resolutions of the UN Security Council.The key to solving the Cyprus problem lies with the Turkish government, which supports and encourages the relentless attitude of the Turkish-Cypric leader upstasch.However, the European Union, with its alleged interest in freedom and human rights, has never been stirring, neither through the tragedy of the Cyprical people nor through the problem of Greek-Cypric refugees, neither by the violent change in the population composition in northern Cyprus nor through the massive settlement of Turks in the occupied areas.Even in this hall, the representative of the council spoke of the northern part of Cyprus and not of the occupied areas.The latest decision by Helsinki, Turkey, to give the accession status without making the slightest concession with regard to the line -up of Cyprus, for example by reducing its military presence there or returning Ammochostos, the Turkish side encourages to insist in an ineffective manner in its unequivocal position.It is no coincidence that Turkish Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit said immediately after Helsinki that the Cyprus problem had already been solved in 1974.This backing for the rigid attitude of Türkiye certainly does not contribute to the approximation of the two communities in the direct discussions under the patronage of the UN Secretary-General.The people of Cyprus have lost a lot on their way to join, and more will lose.The takeover of the community acquisition caused significant problems for the Cyprical economy, in particular agriculture.It requires the sale of the public sector, and it deregulates and destroys the developed system of social solidarity in this country.Mr. President, forgive, but the French cabin has just made a small translation error when it comes to Mr. Alyssandrakis, in the most delicate word of the entire debate.I don't want misunderstandings to occur here.In the French translation, Mr. Alyssandrakis is said to have said: ""The Confederative solution is the best"".However, Mr. Alyssandrakis clearly said, ""the federal solution is the best"".This clarification is extremely important, Mr. President.Thank you for clarification, Mr. Wurz.President, Malta and Cyprus, differ greatly from the countries on the European mainland.For example, the Maltese citizens understood excellently to survive in an unfavorable geographical and geopolitical environment.Their success is essentially based on her enterprising spirit, her dynamics and her flexibility.Malta has a successful light and heavy industry, an emerging financial service sector, a powerful agriculture, a flourishing tourism industry and a wide range of employment opportunities, all, although Malta has practically no natural resources."	de
"Regarding parliamentary approaches, I want to reiterate my thanks to all those, mainly to the rapporteur, who acted and intervened because most of the amendments of the Parliament were incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council, in this case, almost all, although with certain modifications and because in addition, we have improved the first supply in terms of funds.We were able to improve it by bringing fresh money, as we talked about at the time, and this was obtained while safeguarding the prerogatives and the skills of the Parliament.As for the commission, in this interinstitutional game, I think it is always important and I am delighted to underline it.I thank again all those who intervened, especially the Vice-President Provan also, for his wonderful participation throughout this debate, especially during the conciliation procedure, the president of the Industry Commission and also, in particular, Ms. Ahern and all the deputies who participated in this work thank you, Madam Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.Culture 2000 The agenda calls for the report (A5-0009/2000) of Mr. Graça Moura, on behalf of the delegation of the Parliament to the Conciliation Committee, on the Common Project, approved by the Conciliation, decision-making committee of the European Parliament and the Council establishing a single funding and programming instrument for cultural cooperation (""Culture 2000"" program (C5-0327/1999-1998/0169 (COD)).Madam President, I really think that we should no longer have discussed this because we have already said everything during the last debate.Alas, nothing has changed to the fact that the Council constantly discusses culture but does not pay money for culture.We have the feeling, and even conviction, that the Member States would be delighted to be able to erase what they registered in the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. For - Let's be clear - nobody really wants to pay money for culture.This is unfortunately so.We must see it.I would like to thank the rapporteur who, tirelessly, tried to identify this file, in cooperation, of course, with the commissioner.My faith, we had to take note of the fact that if we had achieved our objective on the merits, this was naturally not the case on the financial level.In such negotiation, which should actually generate unanimity, we find ourselves as helpless.The bazaar that takes place there is really not fair.There are always people who can refuse everything and, on the other hand, we, who we hold there, to be very additional money for culture.What we do there is really dishonorable.It is a terrible souk where relationships are unequal.We are nevertheless delighted that this program has become what we wanted to be.It corresponds to what citizens expect from us.We support modest and medium manifestations and not large manifestations;We offer easier access to citizens and lower actors."	fr
Therefore, I propose that this assembly approves in Third Reading the proposals related to the Save program and the conclusion achieved in the conciliation procedure.I would like to remind the Assembly that the Parliament approved in second reading this report containing eight amendments, including the restitution of the original commission budget.The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments, including the one related to the budgetary endowment, and I thank the commission of supporting the budget during the conciliation procedure, because what the Council proposed was unacceptable.In the procedure, an agreement was achieved on the studies and actions aimed at preparing, applying, completing and evaluating community measures.Commitment texts were achieved for five other amendments, including the mention of legislative and non -legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centers and, which is very important, energy audit systems in monitoring the progress of energy efficiency.I hope you all recognize that it is an important achievement.The Parliament stoically defended the issue of financial endowment before the very meager initial offer of the Council.The truth is that it was necessary to hold several meetings until finally the Council agreed to grant a substantial increase in the endowment.We achieved an increase of 2 million euros with respect to the initial amount, which means a decisive increase that I can recommend to the assembly and with which the commission has confirmed that it can execute the programs.This was an important consideration for us.However, I would like to say that it is and has always been a very modest budget and that, therefore, the financing of this program is more symbolic than real.The financing of energy savings continues to depend mainly on the Member States.We must keep in mind when we approve this program.It is a pity that it is more symbolic than real what we can achieve at the community level, because there is great enthusiasm at the local level so that measures are taken, including community measures, destined for energy savings.The community can intervene by contacting local activists with each other in order to avoid trying to reinvent the wheel in each region.We must play an important role in the European Union community in this regard.Save is the only community scale program aimed at promoting rational energy consumption.It focuses on non -technical elements that help build energy efficiency infrastructure and the purpose of the program is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency are promoted.In this sense, we must recognize that there is also a market opportunity for the energy saving sector.We have heard many things about competition problems in the field of renewable energies, but energy efficiency will allow companies to economize, in fact it is saving for all and therefore should not be problematic.It is something that we can all support.I must say that, like motherhood, although we all support it, sometimes very little is what we do to help in a substantial and concrete way to mothers or people who are dedicated to energy savings.We could do much more, considering that we have assumed great commitments regarding the reduction of CO2 emissions and greenhouse gases, in addition to a reduction in dependence on energy imports.	es
A second conciliation allowed an increase of 1.1 million euros to get to this compromise of 77 million.Despite a rise of 3 million compared to the initial proposal, personally, once again depths that the financial means are not at the height of the expressed ambitions and that the concern of the savings manifested by the Council in this situation contrasts too much with its declarations in favor of the safety of the energy supply, the creation of jobs and the protection of the environment - all challenges that must be collected.Renewable energies are an indisputable means to achieve these goals.Yet, despite the reserves that I express on the insufficiency of the financial allocation, I personally support the compromise, due to the content of the program to which the European Parliament has given an effective contribution because, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, this area falls within the code procedure.It is almost obvious that, with the series of proposed measures and actions, one should approach the goal of 12 percent of renewable energy by 2010, that is, to double if the credits as a whole, including those of state, will continue to be there.Together with Save II and the integration of the dimension of the environment in energy policy, this program therefore lays the foundations for an authentic community strategy aimed at ensuring a clean energy while reducing dependence.To conclude, Mr. President, I also allow myself to insist so that, in addition to the proposed measures, there are also legislative measures and above all adequate budgets to concretize these political will.I conclude congratulating myself naturally with the speaker, Mr Langen, for his work, as well as with the members of the Commission and the Conciliation Committee.Mr. President, honorable deputies, I first want to express my satisfaction for the agreement achieved on the Altener II program within the conciliation committee.I join the declarations of the various speakers and I emphasize that this agreement will allow the Altener program to enter shortly in the Energy Framework Program.It will achieve a greater degree of coordination, transparency and efficiency in our energy programs, among which the Save program will also be inserted soon, which will be discussed shortly.In this period Parliament has done a great quality job;In this regard, I would like to congratulate the speaker, Mr Langen, and with all those who intervened both in the commission and here in the plenary.Obviously there were discussions and it was necessary to resort to a conciliation, as the speaker and the honorable Caudron recalled;The first meeting, in fact, had not produced results and it was necessary to meet again, although the figures were not huge.However, I believe that in the end a reasonable agreement has been reached which, like others, despite the imperfections allows us to promote the projects in question.I congratulate once again with the speaker, Mr Langen, for the work done;I thank all the speakers and point out the effective work of the Vice -President Provan during the conciliation, which has made it possible to achieve a positive result.	it
The European Union is currently discussing aspects that, as hopes, China will take concrete measures.Based on these debates, the presidency will send the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union expects China to announce positive steps at the meeting on February 25th.In addition, the presidency will present the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases to which it wants to express their deep concern.At the conference carried out in Beijing in October 1999, it was confirmed on the one hand that the Chinese authorities were willing to make questions in connection with the actual dialogue, with the redesign of the dialogue and with the debate about the legal norms of law enforcement (death penalty, administrative arrest).On the other hand, however, you will not give in with the basic questions with regard to the system of the unit party and the territorial integrity.The debates in the European Union about the situation in China, which followed the results of the 1999 dialogues, made the European Union to make the decision to express its concern about the violations of human rights in China and the lack of concrete results of the dialogue, but also to recognize the positive steps that have taken China on an international level.On several occasions, the European Union has expressed its dissatisfaction with the results of the dialogue and assures that the Chinese authorities were expecting better results in certain, very sensitive areas.It was decided that the dialogue had to be continued, albeit more targeted and efficient, with China approving the European Union's proposal, redeveloping the dialogue through a better use of the experts and a closer connection with the seminars.Last but not least, the human rights commission will also deal with the rationalization of its own work at its next meeting.A working group deals with the revision of the mechanisms of the Commission, it has worked intensively and consent to the opinion that it is essential to increase the efficiency of the existing mechanisms and - especially in the financial sector - to give them a greater assertiveness.The European Union will oppose every unfair attempt behind which the intention is to remove the human rights commission through a realignment of its activities by reducing their field of activity and its constant attention for everything that concerns human rights in the world.Mr President, I would like to thank the chairmanship for his work, which he has done to prepare for the next meeting in Geneva with regard to the topics of racism, civil rights, political rights and the right to develop.As the Council Chairman said, there is still a lot of work ahead of us, even if the claim of the parliament and many NRO, the European Union should clarify its position in good time before the meeting in Geneva.This is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the most difficult questions.For example, many of the points contained in the Parliament's motion to be resolved, for example, and it is still too early to make a forecast of the results in the individual areas.It is not surprising that this debate is lengthy and difficult.	de
In this context, the European Union has to think about it - it started at the beginning of this week - like the neighboring country Yugoslavia - without even taking back criticism of this terrible regime - despite everything can be included in regional cooperation.I will therefore make an amendment tomorrow, with which we will advocate that the sanctions are concentrated on the regime, but on the other hand there are certain relief for the population and also for the economy in terms of economic cooperation.With this in mind, I am grateful - I can mention this because I come from a country through which the Danube flows - for considerations that the Commission, i.e.h.Commissioner Patten, but also Vice President Palacio, with whom I recently was in Budapest, namely to make the Danube again navigable in order to enable a minimum of an economic upswing again in this region, which of course would of course also be important for Romania.I take the view that this regional approach, if it is understood correctly, namely as a method to contribute something to the economic upswing in the region, is the right way.As I said, it must not be perceived as a compulsion and not placed as a prerequisite.Second, I would like to say clearly and clearly that Fyrom/Macedonia is open to the European Union and is offered.We consider it an illusion to believe that it makes sense to make an application for accession now, but we also think it is wrong, we will talk about that later.Now Macedonia/Fyrom wants to have the answer that it will have this option in principle when it comes to it.The country fears that it is placed on a siding.In the entire redesign of the funding instruments, it sees the risk of no longer being the last wagon of a train that moves towards Europe, but that this train moves in Europe and ends up on a siding.But I think that Commissioner Patten also understands that.I really ask him to make it clear with everything to make it clear in the corresponding conversations.Third: I think Macedonia/Fyrom has shown - at least so far - that it is also able to deal well with the instruments.Even if there are changes here, of course, Macedonia/Fyrom will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being done in Brussels today can be developed in Skopje in the future.I hope that the colleagues can agree to this that we accept these applications as a sign of good will to Fyrom/Macedonia.President!Since the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this short name - played a constructive and peace -resisting role.We are reminiscent of the suggestions of the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina at the time, which aimed at a non-violent removal from the Yugoslav Federation structure.So our Macedonian friends have always played a very positive role.For this reason, it must be said here that Macedonia is not simply the subject, but rather the origin of our so -called stabilization struts.	de
We could really ask ourselves, dear colleagues, why 76 % of Belgian citizens have no confidence in the justice of their country, 56 % of French citizens have no confidence in the justice of their country, 53 % of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in their justice ... (the president withdraws the floor to the speaker) Madam President, my group, EDD, and my party in particular, is very concerned about this debate.We cannot support, and we do not support, the opinions and the policy of Mr. Haider and we deplore his references to the third Reich.However, we also regret that your parliament plans to interfere in the policies of a government elected from any country whatsoever, especially when this country is part of the European Union.The party of which I am a member, in my country, is certainly not racist, but we do not gladly accept the laws and interference of the European Union.Are you going to get through the British Parliament if we are elected?Madam President, the citizens of Austria decided to elect Mr. Haider to their parliament.I think it has received 28 % of the vote, therefore Germany will have a coalition government.Let me say that your Parliament, the president, should wait to see if Mr. Haider's party influences the policies of this country.So, and only then, you can wonder if human rights are affected.Your parliament may consider appropriate measures to counter this situation and then, the president, and only then, your parliament can consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union.Madam President, as a deputy for the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns of certain colleagues regarding democratic evolution in Austria.You may be surprised by my reaction if I affirm to be personally unable to understand the exacerbated reaction manifested against Austria and which wonders about its respect for human rights, its ability to assume its past and the stability of democracy.Austria must assume the often doubtful image which prevails in its account, rightly or not, abroad.For years, the refusal of our governments to admit our share of guilt in the horrors of the Second World War and to grant just compensation to Jewish victims and forced workers has significantly contributed to this negative image.Now the FPö has committed, on the basis of the result of the October 3, 1999 elections which sanctioned the former government, in a coalition government with the ÖVP.It is the right of citizens of a state because it is the fundamental principle of a democracy.After the failure of the talks between the spö and the ÖVP, the socialists tried to form a minority government and asked the support of the FPö.You just have to read the newspapers: three ministerial posts were offered to this very party whose fascinating trends are denounced here.When we have declined this offer, incendiary propaganda, which we still do not understand, suddenly exploded.	fr
In particular, it is in the sector of commercial and agricultural policy that the inconsistency with development policy is mostly manifested.We are unable to make a serious contribution to the development of less advanced countries, and this because among the member countries of the Union there are divergences of opinions on development cooperation.We must no longer consider development cooperation as an instrument of external relationships and foreign policy, but as a policy in its own right.I launch an appeal to arrive at a development policy that is transparent, solidarity and efficient.Although the European approach to the problem of development will create greater inefficiency and greater waste of money, it seems advisable to leave more space for the actions of the Member States.Finally, I ask the Commission to send to the European Parliament as soon as possible the document I was talking about before, so that we too can reflect constructively on possible solutions.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, I think this is an appropriate and very sensible initiative.As various colleagues have already said, we often find ourselves faced with a great contradiction between what, on the one hand, we would like to do with the development and cooperation policy, and what, on the other, we nullify with sectoral policies that produce contrary effects, in terms of development, for the same countries.Not to mention the concrete impact of our common policies: tourism, environment, agriculture, fishing, industry.We can speak in general - even more serious - of contradictions between our economic and commercial policies and those on defense.In short, there is a set of contradictory situations.In my opinion, the contradictions are not very serious in terms of community policies, as, rather, compared to certain objectives and industrial sectors of some Member States.We must be aware of this.On the one hand, we often adopt resolutions in peace processes in other parts of the world, as has happened in the recent case of Indonesia that cries revenge on the sky, and then on the other we discover that some European countries were suppliers of weapons and war material.These are, in my opinion, the most serious contradictions in all this matter, more serious than those, which also exist, due to an incompatibility between sectoral policies.We know, it is obvious, that even within a single country there are always contradictions between the various policies.It's normal.We must therefore be aware of the fact that, even at the level of the European Union, there may be contradictions between the different common policies, in this case in the field of development policy.We must be aware of the existence of these contradictions and the fact that must be reduced to a minimum: it is the right and wise objective from which the resolution in question starts.I consider the idea of ​​creating an observatory that follows the evolution of consistency between community policies and cooperation and development policy, whose field of action must not be limited to community policies, but also understand the actions or policies of the Member States, including - seems important to me - the actions of the economic groups, is very wise and appropriate.	it
President, values, values ​​that the rules must be observed, is a matter of course, as is the demand that our partners also comply with them.Understandably, we are worried about this today, but I don't want our claim to be understood as selectively.And I also don't want our oral request to be understood as an indictment.Since our claim is not selective, the Commission must also feel asked to deal with the use of the community money in the neighboring regions of Israel.And since the request to the Commission is not an indictment and must not be regarded as such, I would like to highlight two essential points here for the balance of our attitude.First, who knows the region knows that the future of the Palestinian economy is closely linked to the economic cooperation agreement with Israel.The Oslo protocol provides for a customs integration that includes Israel and the Palestinian Authority.And everything that amounts to a division of the two economies would harm Israeli-Palestinian cooperation, including the joint ventures, the Palestinian suppliers and exporters.Second, the borders of the state of Israel are nowhere in more detail in the agreements between Israel and the European Union.The determination of these limits is particularly important in the ongoing negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.Any attempt by the European Union to want to enforce its own view of Israel's territoriality would be at least a clumsyness that would be detrimental to this negotiations and our idea of ​​the role of Europe in this region.I support the prudent procedure of the commissioner on this matter, especially because this is not a simple question.It is so complicated because it is always difficult to determine the origin and origin of goods.This also applies to the Middle East, where there are numerous joint ventures and some of them are produced in the Palestinian area and partly in the state of Israel, and that's a good thing.These developments vote confidently for the future because this type of trade in the Middle East prepares the ground for a peace agreement.Especially because this is not a simple and easy to solve question, we have to proceed carefully and carefully.The second reason why it is correct that the Commission acts in this way and not otherwise is as follows: If the European Union wants to participate in peacekeeping in the region, it must be fair and fair.However, it would not be fair and just to decide hastily without having talks and meet groups in order to hear their assessment of the situation, both with regard to the area of ​​the state of Israel in relation to the trade agreement as well as, as already mentioned, the goods and its origin.In my opinion, there is another reason to support the Commission.The peace agreement is in a delicate phase.The Israeli government wants to peace, a safe peace, and a premature and over -falling approach could endanger the success of the peace agreement.The negotiations cannot be found the best, this is about a comprehensive solution extremely more difficult questions, and I think the commission acts completely correctly if it carefully weighs, hoping that we can reach this in this way, according to which we all strive, namely a safe, just and permanent peace in the Middle East.	de
"From this point of view, the events that we experience in Austria must be considered tragic.For the first time since the Second World War, an open pronazist, racist and xenophobic party in a European country is ahead of the gates of power.In view of this danger, which the negation of the most very important idea of ​​the European structure, we must not be stopped by anything - not from the legal atmosphericities about what the contract allows and what is not, not from the legitimate questions about the right to interference, not from the ridiculous respect against formal democracy and, above allreject, but on which we have no influence.As a member of the French overseed part of La Réunion, a melting pot, the population of which over the past three centuries of Europeans, black Africans, Madagasses, contract workers from India and Pakistan and also Chinese, I experience the deep truth of the saying of Saint-Exupéry every day: ""If you are different, then I will be my brother, thenThis is not reset, but enriched.For all of these reasons, I decided on the resolution presented to our house about the formation of government in Austria.The rise of Jörg Haider by forming a government between the FPÖ and the conservative right is the resurrection of a historical monster in Europe. The success of the FPÖ is both due to the fact that it was made hopeful by the Austrian rights and social democracy, as well as their politics, whose disaster social consequences have prepared the right -wing extremism.In the resolution, any diplomatic measures for the political isolation of the new government are announced, but without saying even a word about the deeper causes of the resurrection of fascism, which is due to the despair of the population groups that have fallen victim to the king, as well as the decision of the prevailing classes, on a strong regime in order to further increase the reduction and the regulatory policyto be able to.In order to counteract the xenophobic appearance of a dictator apprenticeship, which the Third Reich longs for, every opportunity must be used to express our solidarity with the Austrian anti -fascists.That is why we vote against this resolution despite its lying references to a ""European democratic model"" that resembles more of a fortress that pursues immigrants without papers and disclosed and even recorded young people.- I have just voted against the situation in Austria against the situation in Austria in view of a possible government formation between the ÖVP and FPÖ.I consider the upgrading of Jörg Haider as ""Buhmann Europe"" - worse neo -Nazi and head racist - to be counterproductive.Of course, I by no means agree with the published statements of this right-wing populist and judge xenophobia and every trivialization of the Hitler regime.However, I am afraid that a reaction of Europe that is only emotionally shaped will multiply the Haiders followers to the processes in Austria."	de
But, when the corpus juris was launched effectively in 1997 in San Sebastián-before a very select auditorium of 140 jurists, without invitation to the media-, the president of the European Parliament of that time, Mr. Gil-Robles and Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to expand the competence of the EU in criminal matters to all sectors of the criminal activity.A public debate is necessary in this regard.It is necessary that the Member States and citizens of the Member States be properly informed.It is necessary to address the issue of threat to the traditional legal system of Ireland and the United Kingdom.There must be much more transparency on this issue than to date.It is unacceptable that something like this has been endorsed to the EU member states without an appropriate public debate.Mr. President, ladies, on behalf of the radical deputies, I have refrained in the vote on this text in the Budget Control Commission, because I share the concerns expressed, so authorized, by the representative of another legal culture, without a doubt, important as the culture of the Common Law is.Undoubtedly, with this text we force the hand, since we consider that there are aspects that have to be resolved and that it is decisive to repress and jugulate community fraud.However, the way in which our commission, with the impetus and the stubbornness of President Ms. Theato, intends to carry out this text cannot be free of criticism.Another important criticism of the text concerns the derived law.Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to adopt the necessary measures to fight fraud.However, it produces any perplexity that preconnects an institution that would represent a qualitative leap, without providing since now its effects, that is, that the aspect of the defense is neglected and, therefore, the possibility that accusation and defense can function effectively in such an important legal system.Through abstention in the commission we wanted to express these perplexities.Mr. President, I think it is necessary to make a reflection aloud on this issue at the headquarters of the European Parliament, in the Plenary and in the commissions, although it is evident that the debate cannot dispense with the world of culture, of legal culture and the environments in which institutional affairs are addressed.We were facing very serious episodes that in the past seemed to be a custom.Today something has changed, at least in systems, especially as far as control is concerned, but we are not yet satisfied, especially when in the competent venues you can speak even of a European prosecutor, crimes, fraud, embezzlement and revelation of secrets at European scale.I think we must protect the interests of the community and its image, as well as the relationship with taxpayers that are an indispensable and fundamental part of the life of the community.This is why it is fair to consider the problem of a protection of the interests of a general and universal nature, remembering better with justice within the scope of each of the states.	es
The debate between the convenience of prolonging Lomé's agreement with its quotas and its protectionism, or contrary to progressively liquidate the particular relations between the European Union and the ACP countries in the name of free change is a false debate between two ways of perpetuating the looting and impoverishment of those countries.I rebel against an innoble and inhuman organization that makes hundreds of millions of human beings be literally starving to enrich a minority.It would be enough with only one fraction of the huge wealth accumulated by the large groups so that these countries could get out of misery, but as long as we dared to blame the large capitalist groups, we will do nothing more than hide the real problems.Mr. President, I congratulate Mr. Corrie, co-chair of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, who has had the task that is easy to prepare a report on the difficult issue of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly.In this intervention I will limit myself to expose only some points that I consider fundamental.I believe that the European Parliament must insistently ask that the Assembly be really parliamentary, urging ACP countries to send as representatives of national parliaments, to reinforce their own democratic fabric.My contribution to this debate, in the first place, will be to focus attention on globalization and the WTO, which for ACP countries represent a huge danger in their development.I consider it necessary a transition period for these countries, although, within the space of the new logic and the regionalization of aid, it is also necessary that they are supported not only with agriculture and fishing, but also that they resort to the valuation of mineral and subsoil resources, some of which are exploited with little economic benefit by these same countries.The third point refers to the effort that, through a peer working group within the Joint Assembly, the European Parliament must commit to do in order to achieve a stabilization of the Budgets of the ACP states, through a qualified selection of the points of the budgets, so that there is an economic development but above all social, and also through the control of the income policies and the fiscal policies that are in force in the ACP.We must support the peoples of these countries through the relationship with their rulers, which must be fully aware that the aids to development by the European Union are destined to the people and not to the eventual oligarchies, managers, in some of those states, of all internal and external resources.Finally, fourth point: the prevention of conflicts between ethnicities or between states must be our constant concern and, to some extent, these conflicts could be avoided or through a vigorous and authorized diplomatic offensive, or through the proposals that I have just presented.Mr. President, I make mine the positive assessment of the report that my companion Karin Junker expressed a moment and I will add that Mr. Corrie began his work as co-president of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly with an effective and impartial action that deserves all our recognition.My intervention will be limited to a specific fact that has occurred a few days ago, partly as a result of events referred to in the report we discussed here.	es
In politics, words can be incendiary, they can exalt the spirits or can be conciliatory.We discovered that Mr. Jörg Haider, as the architect of the word, has been a voice that defended racism and xenophobia.He is a man who has taken advantage of fear and has exploited vulnerability.There lies the importance of this debate - to record that when extremism is integrated into the mainstream, something deep is happening today in Europe.(Applause) I hurry to add that our struggle is not addressed to the Austrian people.We respect the rights of the Austrian people about their own democratic process.We defend the constitutional rights and prerogatives of the Austrian people, but here in the European Parliament we have the duty to remember our fundamental values ​​as stipulated in article 6 of the treaty - the values ​​of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights.All conscious members of this assembly believe that these values ​​are universal and indivisible regardless of race, class or creed.We must encourage and defend those rights, while we say to the people of Austria: our struggle is not against you.With regard to the initiative of the Portuguese presidency I would like to say that we support the spirit and political intention behind that initiative.It may not be an ideal initiative in terms of its structure, but we recognize, Mr. President in exercise, who is anchored in idealism, and for that reason we are inclined to support it.I share with President Prodi the preference of the community method and we must analyze article 6 and article 7 of the Treaty.Article 7 contemplates the possibility of suspension in the case of serious and persistent breaches of our fundamental values.We must find, as institutions, the way of measuring and giving meaning to this, so that it has reality and essence.Then, we can work together in the application of the community method to eradicate this cancer in our environment.I want to direct, Mrs. President, a few words to Mr. Schüssel.Mr. Schüssel is a man who has an honorable trajectory in European politics.Now it is proposed to get to the government riding on a political tiger.Mr. Schüssel, prepares to assume a very serious, personal, national and European responsibility.That responsibility, which now assumes, Mr. Schüssel, is to respect the letter and spirit of European treaties.Finally, Mrs. President, the present debate touches the heart of our democratic values ​​and institutions and brings us to memory that the price of freedom is the eternal vigilance.In this continent, especially, with the experience of hateful racism that we have suffered in the past and that such a high price has been charged, we have to insist that today's debate is not about the interference in the sovereign rights of a state.This is the stubborn insistence by the democratically chosen institution of this union that as Europeans we will not tolerate a return to the past.(Alive applause)	es
President, colleagues!I ask you to apologize for my delay, but today God is unfortunately still on the agenda.The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy recommends that you release the 35 million euros, and this recommendation is given because this money can really benefit the people concerned.What makes us critical is not so serious that we didn't want to help people there.But this does not mean that we forget the criticism.Of course, we would be much further in our procedure if the council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament at an early stage and officially forward documents.This is the only way we could have done a really reasonable, in the matter of profound advice.I ask the administration to ensure that this can no longer happen in the future.Only because of the people concerned are we ready to refrain from drawing consequences.But we have to see that we introduce certain conditions here.One condition is that the money is given where it is applied sensibly, and not to those who may be able to use this money in order to pursue other purposes, that is, this money should really go into the responsibility of Mr. Kouchner and not into other areas.Second: Even if the Commission and the Council take a different position here because they see realistic problems, we think that the other donors also have to comply with their obligations that they have received.This is a mission that is under the jurisdiction of the United Nations, and it cannot be that the European Union alone fulfills its obligations!The other donor countries must also meet their obligations during this period in the interest of the people concerned.This means that in the future we generally have to deal with this question much more intensively, not only with this specific project, but with the entire development in Southeast Europe and the help that is given there.This in turn is an example of the fact that the European Union is ready to help the money, but that there is an inconsistency of political leadership.We have so many coordinators who are responsible for so many employers that we will soon have a coordinator for the coordinators.Perhaps it would be better if the responsible bodies of the European Union and the other institutions - from the OSCE to the United Nations - were put together in order to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to check how people can really be helped there.I know that the Commission is intensively considered to achieve this, but if the European Union does the most, it should also have the management there and then bring it in a uniform way so that people can really be helped.There is no point in that we have a competition between the different international institutions and associations than that the strength is really tackled to help people on site!When I see that the encoder conference for the stability pact is being moved further and now, now to the end of March that nobody knows which projects are really behind it if you cannot see in how really being implemented and only new press conferences are given, then this does not seem to be the way we can produce peace and reconciliation of people in this area!	de
"In a common fishing policy, the requirements of species protection and inventory management must be optimally reconciled with those of the economy and the market.For this purpose, extensive, comparable and uniform data, of which we - if they are properly recorded and evaluated - serve more general information about the fishing sector in the Union.However, we also hope that the peculiarities, the differences, the diverse fishing conditions and traditions are better recognized and emphasized and not - as happened in many ways - due to a misunderstood harmonization concept for fishing policy, restricted, restricted or even eliminated.As an example, I would like to lead the Mediterranean and in particular the fishing in Italy.After the GFP for the Mediterranean has been limited to prescriptions for marketing and operating aid for years, regulation 1626 and the measures included in it are finally launched to maintain and protect the fish stocks in order to ensure permanent use of inventory.This is a objective that can be agreed, but when implementing the biological peculiarities of the fish species of the Mediterranean were sometimes not observed.A later regulation, namely the - by no means passed in 1999 - Regulation No. 1448 left some exceptions especially for so -called ""certain Mediterranean fishing"".However, this exemption only applies until May 31 of this year, and the Commission must submit a proposal by then.We hope that this fishing system, which is of vital importance for the economy of extensive coastal areas and, according to the scientific data that has been recorded so far, has a certain sustainability under the aspect of biological tolerance.Thank you very much, Mr. Fischler.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.The report (A5-0036/2000) from Mr. Hudghton follows on behalf of the Council for a guideline for a directive 93/53/EEC to determine minimum measures by the community for combating certain fish epidemics.The infectious anemia of salmon (ISA) is an infectious viral disease that was first registered in Norway in 1984, later in Canada (1986) and finally in May 1998 in Scotland and thus for the first time on the territory of the European Union.Although the virus has also been found in other species, the disease itself has so far limited itself to salmon.The virus cannot survive at a temperature of over 25ºC, and the scientists therefore agree that it is not a danger to human health.It simply cannot survive in warm -blooded creatures.The Scottish salmon breeding industry is the largest of its kind in the EU, and its locations are in the extreme outskirts in areas.It offers about 6,500 people work and generates around 800 million euros annually.It is therefore obvious that this problem for Scotland is of particular scope, but it is of the utmost importance for all parts of Europe that this disease is contained and exhausted if possible.According to the currently applicable guideline, vaccination is prohibited, instead all fish of an affected farm must be killed regardless of whether they are infected or not."	de
With the ratification of the Amsterdam contract, all Member States have expressed that they want to give the same priority against the combating of fraud against the financial interests of the European Union as to combat fraud at their own burdens, but the reality is that the first four member states have only ratified the agreement decided in 1995.The Commission fully agrees with the rapporteur that this situation is not acceptable.A legal act, a guideline in which the fraud, such as money laundering or bribery, is defined uniformly and its law enforcement is bindingly laid down as a goal, can continue to bring an important step further here, and I will therefore propose to the Commission to check this step very quickly.The European Office for Combating Olaf is one of the most important instruments with which the Commission fulfills its obligation to combat fraud.The Commission therefore did not accept that the two European banks ECB and EIB have denied Olaf's right to investigations in these two institutions with reference to their independent position.The Commission therefore decided to collect these two banks in its last session, and I hope that the parliament will approve of this step.The second recommendation of the present report concerns the review of Olaf's examination measures in the various European institutions to their legality.The surveillance committee for Olaf, which was also established with the establishment of Olaf, has the task of ensuring independence from Olaf, but cannot carry out the activity of internal investigative acts in the report.In it I completely agree with the surveillance committee and the rapporteur.This means that there is a gap that must be filled out and I will check the path proposed in the report in terms of further development.However, I can ask for one thing: I think it must be prevented that the debate about an expansion of the legal basis for Olaf leads to the misunderstanding that Olaf does not have enough authority now.No, it must not lead to an undermining of Olaf's authority, and I also think that this is not in the interests of the rapporteur.In this respect, I ask you to fully support Olaf's work in the current form.Thank you very much, Ms. Schreyer.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.Votes (the parliament accepts the Commission's proposal.) Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE).(En) Mr. President, a remark on the application of the rules of procedure.I ask for an explanation of Article 133 paragraph 2 and 138 paragraph 4 of the rules of procedure.Both articles concern the vote.Isn't it the case that, with the exception of votes, is initially coordinated by a hand signal and should only be reached for the electronic voting system in case of doubt?Yes, Value Mr colleague, I had a hand signal voted because no faction had asked for a name.As you know, a name or electronic review is only intended if the MPs require this.In the present case, I can assure you that an overwhelming majority voted for the guideline that we have just voted.Mr President, I did not mean this special coordination, but votes in general.	de
Common resolution on Austria Mrs. President, the Europa of the Nations Group has not signed the common resolution of the PPE/De-Pse on the political situation in Austria following the formation in this country of a coalition government between the conservatives and liberalnationals of Jörg Haider.In fact, this PPE/DE-PSE resolution applauds the initiative promoted by fourteen Member States to exert a pressure on Austria through the organization of a sort of diplomatic boycott.What strikes us most is that this common intervention boasts the principles of the Treaty as if it were written somewhere that, by now, the free and democratic expression of a people can be canceled by the will of the heads of governance of neighboring countries who, in this case, have looked at each other from consulting their respective peoples.Regardless of the verbal excesses of Jörg Haider - which in fact condemn - the Austrians made a democratic choice and we must respect it.It seems clear to us that the left of the European Parliament, in contact with the Austrian left, however defeated in the elections, has designed an exquisitely political maneuver by referring to the memory of a left era, fortunately concluded.Despite the assimilation of Haider in Hitler lacking in credibility, it has partially achieved its purpose by making some deputies of the ppe-de falter.Beyond this political maneuver, what the majority of the European Parliament fears more than everything is that the questioning in Austria of a right-left cohabitation, which has corrupted its political life, soon extends to the European co-management system, which caused equally harmful consequences.To avoid this questioning this majority is willing to everything, even canceling the results of free elections, to establish a Police of thought, to establish a new form of totalitarianism.Mrs. President, on behalf of the deputies of the national front, of the Vlaams Blok and the Italian social movement, I ask this question: who pulls the ranks of the unprecedented interference in the Austrian affairs in which the European Union has taken part, in violation of international law, treaties and morale?Is hysteria spontaneously?Is it the fruit of pure stupidity or, more likely, of a precise strategy, the same everywhere in the world?Who imposes their will to the European nations, claiming to prevent them from deciding their destiny?Any hidden alliance?The Washington government?The Israeli one?Or their socialist spokespersons who, in this classroom, have the brazenness of imposing their values?So what are the values ​​of these socialists, who built their electoral fortune in the last century by deluding the disinherited with the idea of ​​greater social justice, and which today are nothing more than the party of protected officials, trade unionists and state capitalism?What are the values ​​of the Belgian Socialist Party that staggers between pedophilia and corruption scandals, passing through those of Vandam, such as the Agusta scandal?What are the values ​​of the French Socialist Party that blackmailed all the municipalities in which the majority in Urba, Sages, Graco was held?	it
"I have also presented, on behalf of the EDD group, a resolution project in this regard.Mr. President, in recent years the oil tankers have caused repeated catastrophes worldwide without adopted appreciable or effective measures to avoid them.This time the situation is particularly serious, not ultimately because it affects a great European state, a fact that can be repeated at any time.We urgently need a directive that limits these risks.The 15 rules we have are not enough.These offer at least - without pretending to be exhaustive - three guarantees: no oil tanks or cargo ship in conditions for the drain can already scale in any port of the European Union;All parties that intervene, including the consignee of the transport, must respond for the damage caused and must subscribe sufficient insurance policies.Only in this way will it be possible to ensure that the injured can enforce their right to compensation for the damages suffered.However, we must be clear that the long -term objective must be much broader.In other words, we have to evaluate the true costs of our entire energy supply system.Mr. President, let me begin by giving thanks to the palace commissioner for his clear, adequate and also very firm response.Thanks a lot.This also means that I have a lot of respect for the communication of the meeting he sent on January 10, but also for the measures he has announced today.The Erika catastrophe demonstrates that when adjusted regulations are missing in traffic and transport at European and international level, then nature and the environment are evil.The damage inflicted, also in environmental matters, cannot be quantified in money.Hence, we now maintain this joint debate with the environmental transport and protection colleagues.On Christmas holidays, when the Dutch media were paying attention to the Erika catastrophe, I looked on the Internet to find out what was there to take action, especially after Prime Minister Jospin had said that Europe should do more.What I deduced from all that is that there is actually enough regulation, but the problem is that it is not controlled.Let me mention some issues here, which have also been pointed out by the curator.First, the ""Port-State Control"", 25% of the ships that must be controlled.Not only do I think that 25% must be maintained but that it is necessary to ensure that it is more controlled, that is, that 25% are increased.In addition, when a ship is no longer allowed to navigate, not only must we control the facts but there must be a legal system that establishes: it is recommended that you no longer sail or its navigation is no longer allowed.But this does not exist.President, regarding this issue I would like an action to be undertaken.As an end point, in regard to the technical requirements for ships, my colleagues also just indicated that since 1999 in the United States, oil tankers must have double helmet."	es
Is this the message we want to transmit?In addition, one particular point holds me to CUR: Member States must be able, when they wish, decide to set up transnational water transfers.This type of project responds to the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity that we have always defended.In this spirit, it should largely benefit from the support of the European Union, within the framework of the promotion of the Transeuropée networks and the regional policy (through structural funds).I would like to recall that our assembly adopted, two years ago, an initiative report on the technical feasibility of the Transseuropéen hydraulic networks and I would appreciate that the European Commission can soon inform the European Parliament as a result it has given to this report..(Es) We attended the transformation of a report which was first concerned with the quality of water in Europe into a trade war instrument.We all agree to say that water quality is an objective of primary importance, especially because of the opposing consequences that the development of the accelerated industrial growth model has on nature.It is obvious that the logic of private profit specific to this model has been harmful, which is why the principle of polluter pays is adequate to deal with these consequences.But beyond these principles, water must be considered as a common good that cannot be subject to market rules.Surprisingly, I imagine that with the best intentions, we transformed this ecological objective into an instrument of commercial war by making consumers support, especially in the agricultural sector, the price of installations and procedures so that water is of good quality.In fact, water becomes a commodity more subject to market laws.The neoliberal model is thus applied to water.When we do not differentiate the countries and regions where water is abundant, and does not pose any problem, regions where drought and low rainfall make it a rare good, limiting their possibilities of minimum economic and social development, we already alter the ecological principle to make it a devastating weapon.In the same vein, it is somewhat ironic to complicate the possibility of sharing this property, which for certain areas is rare, while those who live in regions where water abounds give water restriction advice to those who live in regions affected by drought.It is this lack of sensitivity and solidarity, which motivated my vote, as a deputy from one of the Mediterranean agricultural regions dry but with prospects like the Murcia region.On behalf of the Labor Party in the European Parliament, I would like to indicate that, although we have supported most of the Lienemann report, we have certain reservations.The date set in the report - 2020 - is not realistic and impossible to respect, but the date set by the Council - 2034 - is too distant.We therefore believe that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	fr
"Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, the proposal for the directive relating to out of use vehicles of which we deal with today curtains on the one hand to guarantee a high level of protection of the environment within the Union, but also to preserve the proper functioning of the internal market in this sector.Two words to say that, of course, historical and era vehicles must be excluded from the field of application of this directive.Even cars, and I believe that we will all agree on this point, they are part of our cultural heritage.Having said that, one of the rocks concerns article 12, i.e. the date of application of the directive.The solution proposed by Parliament, i.e. 18 months from the entry into force of the directive itself, for vehicles entered on the market for the first time, is not very realistic.The European car park has various tens of millions of cars that will have to be withdrawn although they have not been designed at all to be recycled.The common position was more practicable since it provided for the 2006 date for vehicles already in circulation.This would also allow to leave companies the time to set up funds to cope with additional expenses.Like my group, I will support in this regard the common position that in my opinion presents a balanced compromise between the constraints of companies and the indispensable progress in terms of protection of the environment.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, today the European Parliament must adopt an important decision, that is, if he intends to commit himself in favor of a protection of the environment and the consumer who opens a new way for the future or if he is willing to act as a typed to the German car industry, as they let the amendments proposed by the honorable Florenz, Lange and other colleagues suppose.The credibility of Parliament is at stake as a pioneer in the field of environmental protection.It would be extremely demeaning if the Parliament made more than a step back compared to the positions supported by the governments of the 14 Member States and by the Commission regarding the responsibility of the producers and protection of the environment.The intent pursued by the honorable Florenz and Lange is evident: destroy the directive!By proposing to restart responsibility, they aim to deprive the ""polluting"" principle of any content and to suffocate the innovations related to the products in the bud.By frapponing a whole series of obstacles, they aim exclusively to prevent a policy of the flows of materials and, by imposing the authorizations of the different models, want to postpone the application of the directives of at least 12 years, which is completely unacceptable.Therefore launch an appeal, addressing me in particular to the German deputies: do not allow that today such a serious political damage will be fulfilled!On the occasion of the discussion on the directive on out of use vehicles, the green-red government driving the Federal Republic has certainly not been honored.We do not continue with this trend!The complaints about the disadvantages at the level of competition are ridiculous, if it is actually a matter of jeopardizing only the German car industry!Behave by representatives of the people and do not be degraded to representatives of Volkswagen!Vote in favor of the protection of the environment and consumers, as well as innovation in the automotive and recycling industry!Mr President, this directive has been in question since 1997 and it is time to reach an agreement.By sharing the positions of the Honorable colleague Sjöstedt and the Green Representative, honorable De Roo, I will not use both minutes at my disposal, but I will focus only on two issues."	it
Mr. President, dear colleagues, I don't need to remember what the rapporteur said before me and my colleague Coelho.All this is indeed correct and relevant.The euro can easily be falsified.We are currently in a dangerous transition phase during which an unprecedented phenomenon arises on the criminal level, namely that a currency not yet used, not yet put into circulation, but which only acts as a scriptural currency, can nevertheless already be the object of falsification, and this while the offense of false coinage is in this specific case listed by no sanction, of the fact thatPrecisely not yet in circulation.It is therefore a very complex problem.Clearly, if we do not act quickly - I join the opinion of my colleague Cederschiöld on this point -, false euros can now be produced and their circulation cannot be the subject of any criminal sanction.I allow myself to point out by passing that it could be an attractive perspective for some.What is the European Union doing to deal with this possibility?A series of relevant things that our colleague Cederschiöld detailed us.Compared precisely to what has been described, the Parliament should be less lingering on the content of the framework decision and on the report written by Ms. Cederschiöld than on the currently applied procedures.Indeed, the way in which the European Parliament was consulted by the Council, which is by far the least democratic institution in Europe, insults the concept of democracy.We have received for consultation a text that the Council itself tinkered for a very long period, a text which also constitutes only a partial success - but I arrived there immediately.The European Parliament must now take a position, within three months, on this complex, difficult text and, in certain places, contradictory proposed by the Council.It is only thanks to the considerable investment of our colleague Cederschiöld and thanks to the fact that parliament has resigned itself not to make use of its democratic law, which allows it to apply its consultation procedures by having a sufficient period and all the texts translated into each language, that we can now give our opinion within the reduced time desired by the Council and to achieve this fact thatFor a subject as important as that of the protection against false coinage and the criminal harmonization that it requires, we can really not work at the hellish rhythm that advice imposes on us.This is why I want to say very clearly on behalf of my group that we discussed at length with our colleague Cederschiöld to find out if it was reasonable to work under these conditions.We came to the conclusion that it was not but that given the importance of the subject, we agree to accept such a procedure.The proposed framework decision constitutes an undoubted advance.Only the legal certainty desired by the Council - Ms. Cederschiöld has already alluded to it - will not be completely reached completely because, as regards the required minimum standards, the minimum criminal standard and, above all, the application of the same criminal standards in each Member State - even those in which the Euro has not yet been introduced, but in which it could theoretically be falsified -were not filled.	fr
I can only say that these are the hard nuts that you have to cook once and for all!Mr. President, first, I want to sincerely congratulate my colleague, Mr. Van Hulten.It is nice to be able to say that it belongs to our delegation and I can be a bit proud of him, I think.In any case, congratulations on your report.Mr. President, the resignation of the Commission has caused a sense of fear of many officials of the hierarchical and bureaucratic scale.I find all the allegation about making a change towards a culture of responsibility.In the Development Commission I have been able to see very closely how thousands of projects were paralyzed;How, sometimes, up to 80 percent of the money did not be invested, sometimes creating a huge bag of money.And this, not because it is not totally necessary, not because there are no good proposals, but because the whole system stuck by itself.Lack of responsibility, too ex before, very little ex post and hence a culture based on the realization of very few truly effective investments.Spend money effectively and organize all work around this;It would be fantastic to give a signal in that direction with this report.I look forward to that the contribution we will make here, if the first draft report of the Commission becomes an official report on March 1, allows us to see real changes.Without a doubt, it will be a service, Mr. President, provided to the European public and, thanks to the results that we show, we will reconquer and recover something we have obviously lost in recent years.This is the best support we can give to European democracy.If we leave the culture of the 50s and go to the next century, we will live here a pleasant experience.Mr. President, first of all my congratulations to Michiel Van Hulten for his first report.It was a difficult steady, but in the Netherlands we have a nice saying.One learns to swim before if he throws immediately where he covers.Honor, I think that after this test can be classified for the Olympics.There are two points that, in my opinion, deserve special attention from ELDR.First, the individual responsibility of the commissioners.This must be regulated during the CIG.We prefer, however, that this important issue is not completely in the hands of the Council and, therefore, we have submitted an amendment in which we ask that an inter-institutional agreement between the Commission and the Parliament be adopted, in order to ensure a kind of Fall Back-positive and not leave our luck totally in the hands of the Council.The second point, and my colleague, Mr. Mulder, has already said it, is that the Eldr considers that the European Parliament must be investigated by independent experts.This will contribute a lot to recover, in particular, the confidence of European citizens in this institution.We cannot credibility with this renovated commission as long as we do not do an examination of consciousness and the European Parliament also puts their affairs in order.	es
You will find the content of this framework in the priorities of partnerships in membership, which the Commission and the Council have defined last year and which are now implemented in the corresponding planning and management of projects.Unlike this criticism, I would say that one can deplore a lack of coherence in certain areas of European policy but that, in this case, I would like to claim the fact that the Commission and the Council have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy.Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman of the Council, after the Commissioner showed us in an extremely coherent way that the president of the council of the time and his federal minister for European affairs were responsible for the lack of coherence, you might perhaps help the commissioner and ourselves to make this decision.This would help us a lot that you are responding positively to my questions about financial prospects until 2004 and on section 7 or that, at least you declared - as the Commissioner will try to achieve it with the Commission - that the Portuguese Presidency intends to compensate for the lack of consistency of the time by such a commitment.Mr. President, I think that the question asked by my friend Mr. Elmar Brok will be examined by the Council.I think that the criticism addressed to the previous presidency is not relevant.I believe that what was done by the previous presidency in the definition of financial perspectives was an excellent job, regardless of the people who were involved in this work.In any case, the question he poses is important and we will not stop, at the level of the Council, to support the proposals that the Commission will present in this direction.Mr. Chairman of the Council, I thought I understand that our colleague Bro mentioned a still previous presidency.Mr. President, Commissioner Verheugen did not answer my question, however very concrete about the financial instrument Meda.I ask him to answer it, because his answer will determine our voting behavior on various amendments.Commission.(De) dear Mr. Poos, please apologize.There was a blur, at the precise moment when you asked your question.So, with regard to Meda, Malta and Cyprus can participate in the supraregional programs, but not national, because their income is too high.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Verheugen!The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday.Question time (Advice) Question nº 1 of (H-0022/00): Subject: Control of oil access to community waters as following the sinking of the oil tanker Erika off the French coast, which caused a dark tide, what measures does the Council intend to adopt to control access to the community waters of oil and not compliant and not respecting the community standards?Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, on January 24, the Council looked at the consequences of the sinking of the oil tanker Erika which occurred in December.	fr
The European Commission's sixth report offers very valuable conclusions.I would like to summarize two of them briefly, the rapporteur has already taken up, a positive and a negative.The first refers to the fact that significant progress in the territorial and social cohesion has been achieved throughout the Union area and that the community funds represent an important, if not decisive factor in reducing regional inequalities.The negative is that these great efforts in the alignment of GDP and the productivity of European regions showed a greater effect than when aligning their employment levels.It is therefore necessary to bind the structural financing more to the creation of jobs.That, Mr. Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period.So, Mr. President, I ask my venerated colleagues for the approval of this report and, like other colleagues in front of me, I ask the Commission to take into account the conclusions from its sixth periodic report with regard to the planning of the period 2000-2006.President!Mr. Commissioner!Dear colleagues!First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the good work and the factual consideration of the proposed changes received during the treatment in the committee.The sixth periodical report is a good basis for evaluating the enforcement of regional policy goals in the Union and shows that, despite all efforts, growth only takes place unevenly.The regions of Central Europe still have a particularly fast growth, which takes place at a speed in the strong economic centers, which is above the pan -European average, while many southern European and northern regions progress considerably more slowly.Now a profound analysis on the question of why regional policy does not have the desired success in all areas.Is it due to the bureaucracy or have the differences between the regions, the large distances, very cold or hot climate, thin settlement and barren conditions have not been sufficiently taken into account?How does the Union succeed in countering the challenges of global development in such a way that the weaker -developed regions can keep up?It is also important to examine the effects of the expansion on the structural funds and the development of the areas in extreme outskirts.Here, the Member States must not escape their responsibility.Some countries have violated the principle of co -financing and shortened the national funds for the regions, while the regional aid of the Union were increased.That was at the expense of regional policy.In the future, the list of indicators must also be considered, through which measures can be organized for the right place at the right time.For example, uncontrolled migration has not been sufficiently taken into account.In this context, too, the decisive importance of small and medium -sized companies must be emphasized as an engine for employment and regional development.It is very important to introduce the most modern technology and the latest know-how in companies in regions with development residue.Our faction supports the acceptance of the present report.President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues!To date, the European Community's regional policy has not been able to significantly express the existing differences in per capita performance.	de
"This is why we had expressed our keen satisfaction with regard to decisions made on this subject during the Helsinki summit in December.An far too ambitious program would currently risk delaying the enlargement process.This is not what we want and that is why we voted against the report.However, we totally agree with our colleagues to declare that the intergovernmental conference must be transparent so that citizens can realize the evolution of our work..(SV) We are happy that a limited agenda has been set for the intergovernmental conference at the Helsinki summit.Possible future Member States must also participate in the formation of the future EU and have an influence on it.The election of the 1999 European Parliament has shown very clearly that citizens do not follow reasoning on an ever more federalist EU in the Spirit of Brussels..With the opening of the next CIG, the European Union process is again topical.Once again, the debate will be monopolized by the heads of state and government.That is to say that fifteen people will discuss and decide to camera the fate of more than 350 million individuals.We understand, therefore, the disinterest of the peoples in the face of a European construction which is done behind their backs and far from their concerns.Indeed, it is enough to look at the agenda of the CIG: institutions, enlargement and autonomous defense.In reality, it is a question of strengthening executive power, developing annexions to liberalism of the countries of the East and of reviving the militarization of Europe by increasing in particular military budgets.Social Europe, used as a storage by the EU, has disappeared out of the agenda.All this only legitimizes the development, on the scale of Europe, of resistance movements anxious to impose a social charter which would harmonize from above the main demands of workers.This is why I vote against the report.I voted for the resolution which gives a favorable opinion to the summons of the CIG because it enshrines the philosophy of the Portuguese presidency, which benefits from the support of a large majority of the Parliament, the opening of the agenda of the CIG, beyond the points strictly linked to the rebalancing of power between Member States, large and small, as originally described in the summons of the Council of Helsinki.Unfortunately, in the subjects discussed in the resolutions relating to the matters of the Treaty on the European Union which will be subject to revision, nothing indicates, to date, the need to review its article 7, which deals with the suspension of a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the ""founding"" principles of the Union, set out in article 6. As we note with the current crisis with Austria,defend.The legal mechanisms provided for by the treaties are nevertheless weak, of difficult political and legal application, they do not organize the powers of institutions and they do not guarantee jurisdictional treatment to a process of the utmost importance, namely, the conviction of a Member State to a suspension."	fr
Honor, regarding the possibility that the Presidency has in the sense of supporting actions of non -governmental organizations, very particularly in the specific case of the struggle aimed at solving the problems of homeless people, I want to tell him that such initiatives are worthy of approval and on our part there is the best disposition to consider the possibility of supporting them.We have collaborated with Portuguese non -governmental organizations and with some initiatives that those same non -governmental organizations presented in the framework of action of the Portuguese presidency and that we link with the set of concerns underlying our own program.We have no concrete initiative in that regard, but we do not rule out the hypothesis that an initiative of non -governmental organizations that are proposed to that regard is examined during our presidency: that - it is necessary to say it - in the scope of the capacity of action of the Council.But we must understand that everything that may affect the right of initiative of the Commission must obviously be done through the commission itself.Mr. President in the exercise of the Council, he has told us a lot about the future: what will the commission do, what will the presidency be in Lisbon, etc.And he has informed us of something that has scared me, Mr. President in the exercise of the Council.You have said that in Lisbon they will discuss more dynamic and more competitive development.I have begun to be afraid, Mr. President in the exercise of the Council, because there comes social exclusion, at least in part.I do not see how you will be able to answer, if you have opinions of this type.What I have asked and ask again is the following: What are the opinions of the Portuguese presidency in relation to issues such as those that, for example, have presented the networks to fight poverty and against exclusion, with the division of labor and social security, with the application of fiscal policy, especially of speculative capital, with the policy of income redistribution?I would like an answer in relation to this, if the Portuguese presidency has it in mind, and if you intend to do something.Your honor must understand that the effective capacity of an presidency in the sense of investing general or economic trends in its six months of exercise is effectively limited.I think it is perfectly clear that our capacity is also closely related to the logic of intervention, through its right of initiative, of the commission itself.I have talked about the Extraordinary European Council and the initiative that Portugal adopted to celebrate it and I have referred to the future because there are two complementary ways of seeing this issue of social exclusion: one of them is the set of immediate measures that must be adopted to face its specific effects;The second is the creation of competitiveness conditions at the international level that allow us to improve the economic fabric itself within the European Union with positive collateral effects on the problems of social exclusion.And, therefore, the Portuguese presidency has no miraculous keys to answer in six months the issues that always last.It has availability to act before the commission proposals in these spheres in everything that is community competence.It naturally has the possibility and interest of encouraging the entire set of measures that may occur, in particular by non -governmental organizations, but also in a traditional intergovernmental articulation in those spheres.	es
This is the program for the next five years relating to the internal security, freedom, citizens' rights and judicial cooperation sector.This document, in its brevity, is only a farce!A farce precisely because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitore and what is presented on paper is in evident contrast with reality.A document of this type is not the base for a scoreboard at all.He was welcomed and praised as a great conquest, but personally I remain convinced of the need for a scoreboard.Parliament wants to seriously examine the foundations of a program in which future developments come in this political sector.We ask for minimal rules relating to asylum procedures, in order to promptly help refugees but also to clarify towards those who are not.We want tools that allow to prevent abuses.We want a community policy for immigration to be started which obviously also takes into account the ability to integrate the Member States;It is also necessary to enhance the operating functions of Europol, for example, by adopting very concrete measures of fighting against organized crime in this area.We are dealing with these tasks with seriousness and fervor and we ask that the Commission also does the same even when it comes to simply submit a document!Lady president, I also applaud the Commission's initiative to present us with a document on its strategic objectives for the next five years with the hope, however, that it has the intention to correct, with subsequent documents, the too many general information and the nebulosity of the text submitted today to our exam.Having said that, lady president, here I am still shouting in the desert for the absence of fishing policy.It is truly surprising that in the strategic objectives for the next few years, the Commission does not enter the process of reviewing one of its common policies in view of the reform which will have to be developed in 2002. This overhaul process is undoubtedly the most important event among those that will affect the fishing sector for many years to come.However, it seems that this is not the opinion of the Commission, which was however commissioned to submit to the Council and Parliament, by 2001, the report on the functioning of the policy for common fishing in the last decade that will serve as a basis for the Council to make the appropriate decisions aimed at modifying it.In reality, the revision process has already started for many institutions, such as for example for the European Parliament which already in 1998 has developed and approved a report in which all the problems and gaps mentioned by the common policy for fishing were still indicated.Several times we asked for a minimum revision calendar without getting an answer.A period of less than two years is not so much, taking into account that, we must not forget it, fishing policy is experiencing an abnormal situation as regards the rules of the internal market and that these anomalies should be resolved within the reform process.	it
Mrs. President, distinguished ladies and lords deputies, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mr. ProCacci for the report he has prepared.But I would like to thank the commissions that have collaborated and the Parliament for the broad support they have given to the Leader+initiative.This initiative aims to give rural space new impulses to develop and rehearse new and original approaches, approaches that should later be included as models in general programs.I also celebrate that Parliament essentially supports the conception of the commission that the Leader+ program is applied in all rural regions, that higher priorities must be introduced and that, above all, it is necessary to promote active cooperation and interconnection of rural areas.In this regard I find that Parliament shares the opinion of the commission that priority must be granted to the execution of Leader+ in the form of global subsidies.To answer some concrete questions that have been raised here I can also confirm that we want to have in the Leader+ a participation and partner as possible.The different groups, whether environmental organizations or groups whose objective is employment, have the possibility of collaborating in the elaboration of the commission directives.And they are not less, but more, the resources that are made available to this period.I would also like to remember that it is not something new that we constitute an observatory.There has also been an observatory in Leader I and Leader II.This office has exclusively the objective of keeping the interconnection of the specific groups of the Leader.The financing of this observatory should not exceed 2% of the Leader resources.As regards the possibility of projects that have the training and training as content, I must say that this is precisely a point that we have now integrated into the new rural development policy, so that from our point of view it is not necessary to do this in the framework of the Leader.Now step to the content of the report.In point 14 the Parliament urges the commission to present without delay a report about the evaluation of the Leader II.I would like to indicate only that at the present time this does not make much sense because, as in the past - in concrete, until the end of 2002 - funds can be withdrawn according to Leader II.For this reason, we are of the opinion that it makes more sense to carry out this evaluation once the program concludes.Obviously, we will do it and we will send them a report in this regard.In point 18 the Parliament proposes that a compendium of examples of successful initiatives be elaborated.For this purpose I cannot help but say that it exists.It has already been prepared by the commission and I can make it available to each member of this assembly that is interested in it.In point 21 insists the parliament that we must approve the guidelines related to the Leader+ so that the programs can begin.	es
We find it, as always, faithful to the fundamental values, to those principles that have always guided its action.He also reminded us of his 1994 speech, he himself called provocative;In this regard, it must be said that utopias can sometimes be productive and we have been able to evaluate the path together together.You also appropriately highlighted the fundamental role of civil society, not only in relation to the candidate countries but also within each country of the European Union, to restore confidence to citizens and credibility to social solidarity, which we need so much.Finally, synthesizing the concept that has struck me the most of her speech, she wanted to explain to us that, beyond the economic aspects, the construction of Europe must first be a work of the spirit.We sincerely hope to continue this work with her.Thanks Mr. President.(The solemn session ends at 12.40) Joint assembly ACP-EU The agenda bears the discussion on the annual report A5-0032/2000, presented by the honorable Corrie on behalf of the Commission for development and cooperation, on the results of the works of the ACP-EU shareholders' meeting in 1999.I hope that the number of deputies present in the classroom is not an indication of little interest in the activities in favor of development in overseas countries.However, it is a current practice that the report on the works of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is presented to the deputies of the European Parliament and I have the welcome task of doing it tonight.Once again I can report two highly important sessions that have taken one in Strasbourg and the other in Nassau.In many respects it was the end of an old era and the beginning of a new one.The ACP-EU equity assembly is a unique organization of its kind on the world political scene.In what other location 86 nations meet to discuss issues of common interest?The Strasbourg session was the last chaired by Lord Plumb.To pay homage to the exceptional work he did in a difficult period, the office of the Jeal's Joint Assembly has elected him honorary president, and now that he has come to the end of his career we want to give him our best wishes for the years that will follow.The two sessions were dominated by the negotiations for the renewal of the Lomé Convention: I look forward to the new agreement and that all the countries concerned will be signed as soon as possible.I remember that on the occasion of the last intermediate revision, when I was a speaker, the then commissioner Marín said that there would be no one another.Well, he was wrong and I would like to pay homage to Philip Lowe and his team who worked with such success behind the scenes to conclude a new agreement in very difficult circumstances.I was also very pleased to listen to the declaration of this morning of Commissioner Nielson, who worked tirelessly to ensure the success of the negotiations.I pay homage to him in particular for the success achieved, but also to the honorable Kinnock and his working group for the commitment made for Lomé's future.	it
Now that you, Mr. Prodi, and your predecessors have deprived citizens of their right to self -determination, the quality of the work carried out in Brussels must improve significantly and that these works take place in full transparency so that citizens have at least the impression of being heard.I would just like to make a remark about what M. Dell'alba said about the dream of the founding fathers: so read the Memoirs of Jean Monnet.His dream was to create what he called a small practical secretariat.It is certainly not this small secretariat that Mr. Prodi is now president.The president, this morning, this morning, the President of the Commission, Mr. Prodi, explained the ambitious objectives of the European Union for the next five years, of the laudable objectives, in fact, to ensure a strong and effective European presence in the world: to ensure the success of the enlargement, to take up the challenge of selling electronic Europe, to introduce better principles of governance.We design that Europeans, especially the new generation, need to be given a broad view of the situation that Europe will occupy in the years to come.But, how can we succeed when the available resources are limited and when the credibility of our institutions is started?We must match this project to reality.On this point, there are three elements that I would like to exhibit.First of all, we need a flourishing European economy.We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to drop everywhere in Europe, consolidate the tendency to privatization and deregulation, encourage the introduction of information and knowledge technology of the Internet, show that electronic Europe is a favorable initiative.However, we must avoid falling back into the crossing of the regulation at the old fashion, which stifles the initiatives and the spirit of individual enterprises.We must not fear globalization, but we must make sure that we understand its political impact within the Society of Networks.Without a flourishing European economy, we will not be able to meet the challenges that await us, and more particularly the challenge of enlargement.Then, we must take care to legislate only if necessary - in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.Do less, but better - a central point of the last commission - must also become the objective of this Commission.We will examine this point in detail when we pass the annual legislation proposals to annual programs.Mr. Bonde rightly said that there is this image of doing less but better and then, suddenly, we note that the annual program for the year 2000 has 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to indicate a completely different direction.We must establish priorities and ensure that money is used wisely in each of these programs.Finally, we must make sure that the European Commission will be reformed adequately, true.Yes, the commission - guardian of the treaties - is supposed to be an independent body, but it must also account for European citizens through our parliament.The problem of information, to which M. Bonde has just referred, is treated as if it was a simple possibility, the commission giving the appearance of restricting the information to which, as citizens and as parliamentarians, we are entitled under the treaties.	fr
The advent of the euro at the beginning of the past year has unleashed enormous competitive tensions between the European companies to which it is caught with a wave of mergers of unusual proportions.To give an example, the figures relating to last year indicate a total value of the mergers in Europe equal to 1.4 trillions of euros, or seven times the level of the peak recorded in the year of the previous boom in the mergers in Europe, 1990. This situation places enormous challenges for competition policy, which I hope will be collected, since it is certain that many of these mergers will be intended to protect the company's profits from the competition from the competition thatproductivity and put companies in the position of operating on a larger scale.Commissioner Monti and his colleagues are faced with a challenge of gigantic proportions and the group of liberals, democrats and reformers is worried by a possible spelling of the competition policy, you want on the front of the examination of the mergers, you want from the point of view of surveillance on restrictive practices.The delegation of powers to the national authorities is a excellent thing, but we want to underline an assumption done by the honorable von Wogau in his report regarding the need for constant surveillance on the national authorities to prevent any drifts in the European component and we would like, in particular, that the commissioner would reassure us that there will be random checks on the subject.Mr. President, in the scarce time at my disposal I wish to support the work done by all the speakers and to agree on many of the statements heard in this discussion, and in particular with his colleague Jonckheer in criticizing the excess of data aggregation and in underlining the need for transparency and a socio -economic budget of aid.I also share the criticism relating to the insufficient attention dedicated to the development of article 82, especially when witnessing abuse of dominant position in a context of market concentrations.As a deputy of the Basque Country, I want to manifest full support for the measures for the application of the necessary market competition.If I say this is to dispel any doubt made by the criticisms that we have addressed to the Commission in general, and to Commissioner Monti in particular, to have opened a procedure against the incentives provided to Basque companies, considering them state aids.Our dissent is due to the fact that the Commission still shows not to understand the nature of the general system and co -responsibility of our system, by virtue of which the Basque tax provisions have the same nature, the same foundation and the same purposes of the provisions of the States of the European Union and are generally applied to all taxpayers who, based on the rules governing the relations between the State and the regions in tax matters, must undergo it.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, it's true, we need competition!We need it to minimize unemployment, to have a high level health care, for social justice, to have high social standards;Then of course - and these are criteria for competition from national economy - we also need competition between companies: the highest quality of the products, the same conditions of access to the market for all companies, environmentally friendly products.	it
The union to 28 cannot be widening without dealing with the question if Europe has some principles, some common values, if it is reduced to an economic area of ​​free trade or if, on the other hand, it has a larger aspiration: wanting to be a supranational union, in ways to be defined, which also wants to trace a new path of civilization and democracy in the world.This is what you wanted and it means when asking for a European Constitution.The modification of the treaties was instead limited to a revision of some internal rules, a necessary and important revision but which does not respond to the fundamental question that precedes it: what is Europe, what are its common principles and, therefore, its objectives and limits?But politics takes revenge and, driven out of the window from a debate of a limited agenda, returns, in reality, from the door, and from the main door with the Austrian case, since in Austria a party goes to the government that seems to be recalled to intolerance, xenophobia, for forms of racism.And it is not a problem of ties with the past;It is a problem of perspectives for the future, and there is nothing more wrong than dividing, on this, between right and left.I belong to a world, that of liberal Catholics, which is not on the left but that to the values ​​of tolerance, to the European common values ​​it is attacked as much as all the others and that has nothing to do with lines that deny these values.The advice has done well to put this theme to Europe and the world and if these values ​​do not refer to a fundamental card of rights, in a European Constitution, we will build a Europe that will have no solid and lasting bases.I know, Commissioner Barnier - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese presidency share these values: take advantage of the glimpses that leaves you the December conference to insert these themes and these principles, because only in this way will we build a lasting Europe.Mr. President, I find myself in the pleasant situation in which I can refer to some interesting interventions by a small group of Nordic skeptics that oppose the violent and rampant integration process that deeply threatens all democratic Europe.I think of the interventions of the Honorable Bonde and the Honorable Sjöstedt, who indicate that this proposal contains a series of relatively unconscious initiatives, but undoubtedly rational and dictated by power, towards a centralist and federalist European Union.The problem of the monetary union and central management have reasoned rightly, exposing some alternative democratic principles.I can add that all the rational political agitation in my country, Denmark, is dictated by the fact that we enormously increase the number of countries belonging to the European Union and therefore we expand in width, so it is impossible, at the same time, to carry out an integration deeper by carrying out a more intensive qualitative integration in the direction of the United States of Europe, which has happened so far.	it
I not only did this because I was born in a city by the sea, namely Genoa, but above all because the borders of the regions washed by the sea are just limited.These limits open the gate to the African states and the Middle East: We have to consider more that it is important to develop the coastal regions all over Europe.As a member of the MEP of a border region, this third Interreg initiative is of particular interest to me.One cannot indicate the difficulties that occurred in the past in the economically, socially and culturally separate border regions on the coasts and inland.Due to the presence of the border, they became marginal zones of their respective states, which often caused the government agencies to neglect these regions as part of national politics.Therefore, the Interreg community initiative was launched in 1990.It pursues the goal of promoting the cross -border, transnational and interregional cooperation as well as a balanced development of the common space in order to strengthen the Union's economic and social cohesion.Via Interreg, joint projects in the areas of SME funding, professional and general education, cultural exchange, healthcare, protection and improvement in the environment as well as energy, transport and telecommunications networks are financed.I would particularly like to emphasize that interregional cooperation contributes to involving the local and regional local authorities in the European integration process.In fact, it is important to promote a more active participation of local and regional authorities in the community initiatives, since the local and regional local authorities often only have very limited cooperation opportunities due to the differences in the legal framework and in the level of development on both sides of the border.As part of the cooperation in the border area close to the border, the improvement of the framework conditions for the workplace -buying medium -sized companies must apply special attention.Likewise, given the fact that 50 % of unemployment, the funds provided by Interreg are structurally due to the fact that they are so extensive that they are so extensive that they are sensibly complement the national measures to promote employment.In concrete terms, cross -border mobility is too often prevented, made more difficult or particularly problematic by obstacles in connection with tax policy (double taxation) and social security.My wish is that the projects within the framework of the individual programs contribute to finding solutions to these problems and the principle of free movement of the employees, with whom it is not particularly good in my region, to give a concrete content.Furthermore, the Interreg funds must also contribute to the formation of a European research area.And last but not least, there are also great expectations of this initiative in the regions, since the places that are not eligible under goal 2 hope from Interreg!So it is about a lot, because the integration of the border regions is an important element for the development of a future European spatial planning policy!It remains to be hoped that this is as aware of this as F. Decourrière, which I would like to congratulate.The Interreg Community Initiative is part of a harmful European regional policy.However, this policy, which is generously, since it is officially intended to support the regions in difficulties, is a bad business for French taxpayers, because France contributes 17 % to the European budget, but only receives 8 % of regional structural funds.	de
"(The session is lifted at 00:05) Wallowing the Erika The agenda calls for the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr. Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Fisheries Commission, to the Commission on the shipwreck of Erika.Mr. President, the Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to greet the consideration that Mr. Fischler had to be today among us.Yesterday, our president had announced to us that he was going to be absent because of his agenda.But I believe that he thought and that he did what he is used to doing: having consideration and respect for this Parliament, as he has always been able to demonstrate, and I thank him.I’m raising the voice today in this hemicycle, on behalf of the European Parliament Fisheries Commission, in order to focus our concerns again on the sinking of the oil tanker Erika.A double political consideration leads our committee - as well as myself, as president of this commission - to raise their voice in this case.First of all to demonstrate to the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this Parliament cannot or want to forget this serious accident.And then to focus today on a concrete aspect of the serious environmental disaster caused by this accident, namely its impact on the fishing and aquiculture sectors of the affected regions.The epilogue of this accident must undoubtedly be the urgent adoption of measures to repair damage and to avoid that such a disaster will not happen again in the future.No more lamentations and reflections.We must all, Mr. President, go straight to the goal and adopt measures.First, safety in maritime transport - especially when it comes to transporting hydrocarbons and dangerous goods - requires effective controls in community waters and its ports.Questions such as the construction of ships, the double hull, its age, the control of classification companies, insurance, the creation of databases including all the necessary information, cooperation and community coordination, reinforcement of inspectors' control, responsibility for cargo cargo and owners must be addressed and in this regard, the Commission is best placed toMaterials.Transport ensured by the pavilions of complacency - which also do so wrong to fishing that we have called for ""responsible fishing"" must also be subject to specific surveillance and regulations.The entry into community waters of ships with complacency pavilions must be controlled in community waters that do not meet community security standards.We are waiting for the Commission to take concrete measures.With regard to the fishing and aquiculture sector - which are particularly important, developed and prestigious in the affected areas of Brittany and Vendée - the European Commission must promote the damage caused, the evaluation of the latter and the specific measures of any type that it thinks of adopting - political, economic, social, financial measures, etc.To repair the damage caused to fishermen and industries that were seriously affected overnight.How will we be able to recover the confidence of consumers with regard to products from this region?What will be the compensations for the victims?We are faced with a very serious problem that the European Union - economic, commercial, industrial, and fishing power can afford to leave without a solution.Mr. Commissioner, you have to work.We must be pioneers and avant-garde in questions of destruction of the environment, industries and professional activities."	fr
I am against the amendments from n.7 to n.13, which were also decisively rejected by the fishing commission.Their content is largely useless or is already contained in my proposal.In particular, I focused on the need to study the extent of the disease and the interaction existing between breeding and wild salmon, to discover the origin of the disease and to extend research on virus to wild species.These amendments, presented by the green deputies of the Verts/Ale group serve to justify amendment no.18I must emphasize that the current directive prohibits the sale of infected fish and that certainly no proposal aims to modify this rule and allow for sale.The amendments from n.7 to n.13 simply do not take into account the reality represented by the contrasting data of Scotland and Norway.A Draconian arrangement has been applied to Scotland that did not achieve the objectives that had been set up.In Norway, thanks to the greater experience, the mandatory eradication of 100 percent of the fish was abandoned a few years ago and a series of measures have been adopted that have clearly improved the situation.It is in our interest to contain the disease in Scotland and prevent its propagation.Last week in Scotland a report on the contagious anemia of salmon carried out by a joint working group between government and industry was published.This exhaustive study takes into account a wide range of possible risks and suggests how to fight the disease in fields such as transmission from one place to another, the safety measures to reduce the escape of salmon, the treatment of slag and effluents, the methods of detection and diagnosis, the reproduction and rotation, the disinfection of the equipment, etc.Some of these measures will be applied immediately by the local authorities who will take advantage of the tools available to them, while others will be implemented in the conduct codes.All these measures will serve not only to combat the infectious anemia of salmon, but also to reach higher quality standards in aquaculture in general, where necessary.Ladies of colleagues, voting in favor of my proposal as approved by the Commission for Fishing, you will allow the introduction of a wider package of rules in Scotland on the control of the disease based on the reality of the Scottish situation and on the positive experiences of other countries.I congratulate the honorable Hudghton, fully support his relationship and ask the honorable deputies of this parliament to do the same.As the speaker said, fish breeding represents an important employment source for some remote areas of Rural Scotland.Now that these areas are crossing the worst recession of the last hundred years, the aquaculture industry provides an essential push to the rural economy on which many thousands of jobs depend directly and indirectly.Currently, as the speaker said, more than 85,000 tons of salmon are produced in the Scottish farms: it is an industry that fruit more than 800 million euros every year.	it
"Amendment no.16 endangers the protection of investors, because the prohibition of establishing a guarantee at the custodian represents a district in Terminis.Also transactions relating to loans of securities made through compensation or bags - in contrast with the purchase and sale of securities - are not automatically covered by these entities.For this reason we cannot transpose the proposed amendment.Amendment no.42 concerns a provision that has not been changed by the proposal and that has not caused any problems since the implementation phase of the directive.Therefore I do not see any reason to suppress article 22, paragraph 3, and consequently I reject the amendment.Amendment no.44 cannot be accepted as, if you have that the non -harmonized funds must apply the rules ""envisaged by the directive"" relating to the hiring and granting of loans, purchases carried out in a position without coverage and custodian, only very few funds, such as the Swiss ones, could be taken into consideration to make investments.This is in contrast with the aim, pursued by the Commission, to expand the range of investments and the formulation of the amendment could violate the general agreement on services.Amendment no.47 is unacceptable as regards the changes proposed in paragraph 1 of article 22 bis, because in total contrast with the rules relating to the distribution referred to in Article 22, especially if the OICVMs are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospects, as decided by the Council.The main problem concerning the first proposal, however, is represented by the amendment presented by Parliament which allows you to use the Over the Counter tools for generic investment objectives.The Commission draws attention to the fact that, based on the legislation in force in some Member States, the use of OTC derivatives for generic investment objectives is already admitted.The Commission also expresses reservations in consideration of the greater intrinsic risks connected to these investments with respect to the more traditional financial instruments.I think the OTC tools could cause problems, as they are not liquid, their price is difficult to evaluate and involve discovered risks for the counterparty.It does not seem appropriate to opt for an extremely cautious approach in relation to investments such as non -harmonized funds or deposits, and at the same time allowing investments, much more risky, in the OTC tools.Rejecting amendment no.39 of the speaker, the commission for economic and monetary problems has lined up on the same line already adopted by the Council.The approval of this amendment presented by Parliament would have the consequence of allowing the theoretical to the funds to invest in OTC tools and to negotiate the rights to participate in their funds in the entire internal market.In practice, access to other community markets of these funds, theoretically harmonized, which invest in OTC tools could be blocked due to the application of different national regulations and protective measures against OTC investments.This would be in contrast with the fact that the community legislation embraces all the funds that invest in OTC tools.In consideration of this possible negative consequence for the internal market and the intrinsic risks of the OTC tools, the Commission cannot accommodate the amendments nos.12, 15, 37, 38, 39, 43, 46 and 48 and the parts of the amendments nos."	it
They also answered them as I knew they would answer them.I would like to link it to something that Mr. Goodwill asked, namely with our relationship between the precautionary principle and the world outside the European Union.I don't ask that without reason.You rightly said that the precautionary principle is necessary if science has no evidence.How do we make sure that we don't make ourselves more vulnerable, for example with our partners in the USA - and the organic safety protocol is not enough?How do we ensure that the men's colleagues do not always go away their legs from their predecessors like the last few times?That is exactly what it is about, otherwise we don't need to talk about the precautionary principle, Ms. Commissioner!President!I think it is very important to refer to the guidelines contained in this communication that apply to the use of the precautionary principle in order to ward off claims that we would always apply it for protectionist reasons.I am convinced that we will have more conflicts, for example with the USA, in the future.It would be naive to believe something else.Since the signing of the Montreal protocol, however, we have had international confirmation and a joint definition stipulated in a protocol on the environment, health and trade.This can therefore be seen as a good example.We have to make ourselves so that there will continue to be conflicts in the future, but now we can prove that we do not apply the precautionary principle arbitrarily.We now have a series of guidelines that are clearly defined in the communication and a strong backing among the population.Thank you very much, Ms. Commissioner.Due to the attention that is shown to the principle of political provision, we have discussed almost two hours about it, and now this topic is considered, so to speak, as more of an ongoing administration, although, as we could see from the speeches and answers, the subject is important.The pronunciation is closed.Government conference on the agenda follows the report (A5-0018/2000) by Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos and Jo Leinen on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Questions about the convene of the government conference (14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825 (CNS))).Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the Portuguese Council Presidency and the Commission for the numerous extremely useful contacts recently.My further thanks also go to my co -ray store, Mr. Leinen, to the excellent cooperation.The upcoming government conference is important both in general and especially with regard to the upcoming expansion.It depends on the consultations there on how Europe will be structured in the 21st century and how it will work.In order to make the processes in the future European Union more efficient, democratic and transparent in every respect, understandably a comprehensive and profound reform of its institutions is required.The first and most important prerequisite for the success of this reform is the agenda, on the basis of which the government conference will start work.The agenda agreed on the summit in Helsinki is not sufficient and offers no guarantee that the necessary and fundamental changes are made for the creation of a more functional, more efficient, more democratic and more transparent Europe.	de
"In turn, the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, will take initiatives to initiate and enrich this public debate.Cross -border services Mr. President, Dear Commissioner, esteemed colleagues!First of all, I have to apologize that my voice is already a little attacked today, but as an Austrian MP, there has been a lot to explain and talk today.First of all, I would like to thank the Commission very much for the initiative that she took, and for these two guidelines that we discuss here today.It closes two serious gaps in the internal market, which are of great importance for the European economy and 5 million third -state citizens in the European Union, which are here as an employee or as self -employed.The current situation, and that should be called again, is in such a way that there are judgments of the European Court of Justice in the area of ​​employees, in particular the judgment in Rush Portuguesa and van der Elst.They have made it clear that freedom of service must allow third -country citizens to use as an employee for cross -border services and to be able to do so without obtaining work permits.However, the question of visa and residence conditions was not explicitly addressed by the European Court of Justice, and the Member States could not clarify this question as a result.But also with regard to the elimination of the work permit, not all Member States have adhered to the knowledge of the court and today still maintain a large number of inadmissible barriers for cross -border services, barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for smaller companies.In the case of the self -employed, the situation is in such a way that the current community legal level does not provide for third -country national citizens to provide cross -border services.In any case, you need a legislative act here. Both guideline designs aim to facilitate the freedom of service from EU companies.It is not about original rights for third -country countries that are reproduced to freedom of movement.All regulations that enter and residence law questions can be seen as accessory to this freedom of service.I and with me the committee for law and internal market of the European Parliament are therefore of the opinion that the legal bases elected by the Commission are the right one and that the counter -opinion represented in the report of the legal service of the Council is inaccurate.I therefore do not see a real legal obstacle that both guidelines are treated quickly in the council.I also think that the changes proposed by the parliament should facilitate the acceptance of the guidelines in the Council to the Commission proposal.Many of our changes go back to concerns that have also been expressed in the council, and we try to reconcile these concerns with the mandate, the law and economic reason that will be applicable to us.Especially with regard to acceptance in the Council, I can only appeal to the Commission to adopt the changes adopted by the parliament as completely as possible, even if they deviate far from the original commission proposals.I am firmly convinced that on this basis we can easily find unity in the council.Now to the most important changes we propose.A major difference is that instead of a system ""Service ID plus display of each individual order"" we no longer provide a possibility that the prior notice to the reception state can be requested for each individual order."	de
"This morning there were seven helicopters and naturally those helicopters only operate in the Gaza region.The Save River also presents huge problems of overflows, but so far no one has gone there.85% of the work is located an hour from Maputo, so we have no idea of ​​the magnitude of the problem.I would also like to say, Mr. Commissioner, that European citizens want to know exactly that they are doing.To most of those we find here we would not like to boast of the 3 million euros.We must do much more and I hope the commissioner returns with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate the efforts that are being made in the area.It is clear that great capacity air transport is also needed, in addition to, as you say, tons of food, water purification equipment, shops, blankets.Are we really prepared for the next phase of help and rehabilitation to which it has referred? Because it will also require huge resources.Are we willing to provide these resources?Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world, although it is also one of the best examples of overcoming that we find in Africa, and among its achievements include economic growth, the reduction of poverty and democracy, despite the enormous pressures that the debt represents.Mozambique is a wonderful example, but now he can suffer huge hardships as a result of what he has had to endure.What we should now analyze is to what extent the catastrophe will go back to Mozambique, and that depends entirely on the quality and amount of international aid that this victims receives.Thank you very much, Mrs. Kinnock.Mr. Nogueira, I have to tell you that we take note of your interest and concern for this issue, but your group is not registered to speak, and I will comply with the regulation.The debate is closed.Economy of the Union (1999) In accordance with the agenda, we proceed to the debate of the report (A5-0041/2000) of Mr. Katiforis, on behalf of the Commission of Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the document of the European Commission: ""Situation of the Economy of the European Union in 1999"" (C5-0081/2000-2000/2046 (COS))..(En) The commission report presents a flattering evaluation of the current situation of the European economy, especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth that it is expected to lead to a reduction in unemployment to 8% before the year 2001. In the opinion of this speaker, this image contrasts with the backward background and an annual growth rate of just 1.9% during the 199elevated during that decade that, however, could not consolidate.It should be deduced that if we do not want the same failures to be repeated, we must take this opportunity that gives us the greater economic performance to launch a new transition policy towards higher levels of sustainable growth in our economy.That is the challenge.Given this challenge, the commission fundamentally recommended that our economic policy should only prolong our position of the past, which was limited to correcting the monetary and fiscal bases of the economy, while for everything else it was trusting that the markets work the miracle without any other intervention of agents with social conscience."	es
Is there any colleague who wants to intervene on behalf of the PSE Group to submit the application?Mrs. President, indeed I owe an explanation to Mr. Wurtz, and I'm going to give it to the whole Parliament.We had reached that principle agreement at the Presidents Conference.At that time I did not know that the commissioner, Mr. Bolkestein, would appear next week to talk about this issue before the Transportation Commission, Regional Policy and Tourism, and in my group the issue has been discussed and it is considered that, given the current situation in the entire process of integration of the market and deregulation in such a sensitive issue, it is appropriate that the parliament, regardless of what it does in the future,Commissioner, Mr. Bolkestein, take good note and to guide the debate next week.Mrs. President, I would like to ask, without more, to our colleague, Mr. Wurtz, who relevant what it is.It is not a substantive discrepancy, but only the following issue: when the commission, once and for all, will be able to present the board after having had three and a half years to do it?What we want with the resolution is only that now, the deadlines that were promised, and in this regard it is important that we act as quickly as possible.For this reason I would like to support the request of the social democrats to take the vote on Friday.(Parliament manifests its conformity) Mrs. President, certainly, the Cederschiöld report has been withdrawn from the agenda on Thursday.For this reason we should have a little more time on Thursday.Since in emergency issues we are very urged of time due to the large number of issues that we have to discuss in an hour and a half, I would like to ask only if the session service could check if we could have a half hour of time for emergency issues, so that there was enough turn of the word.In my opinion, the economy of the sessions in recent weeks has seemed a bit chaotic.We had a great tinning in regards to the word shift and, suddenly, last Thursday we had a time and a half time space, in which no matter was listed in the order of the day and we had to wait for the vote.On Friday of this week we have only one theme.This is certainly absurd.I would really ask for the management of the partial period of sessions to be reviewed.This is very possible: let's see if we can prolong the emergency session one more hour, taking into account the withdrawal of Mrs. Cederschiöld's report.It is unique and exclusively about this.Mrs. President, she wanted to intervene in relation to a point of the agenda on Wednesday, which her honor has not announced.	es
I will expose an example.The European Union rightly granted help to the Grönitz Righting of Brandenburg, despite the fact that its 5,000 jobs have now been reduced to only 700. But these are competitive, since this steel is currently the second producer of steel tools of the Federal Republic of Germany.Those who now jeopardize the production of this steeling by demanding the return of these aid, not only threaten the steel, but also an employer of that region, which also also depend, naturally, several small and medium enterprises.Of course, this cannot be the policy of competence of the European Union.If we want competition, we have to combine the political-economic demands with the requirements of the business economy.This is also the only possibility of establishing regional economic circuits in underdeveloped regions, which allow people to offer social security and improve their purchasing power.As part of this approach, we must also take into consideration the economic policy oriented to demand instead of focusing exclusively on the economic policy oriented to supply.Mr. President, since I was chosen to this Parliament in 1994, I had never seen a report with such statements and anti -surrounding connotations such as the Jonckheer report that we are debating today.I would like to quote the following: the greatest state aid per inhabitant corresponds to Italy, Germany and Ireland.If we group the national and social regional and social funds, Ireland clearly occupies the first position.I think the rapporteur is limited to playing with the figures.I find it difficult to understand how regional and social funds can include in that mathematical equation.I would like to remind the honor that the European Union has approved the new guidelines for regional aid for the period that begins in 2000. It was a simple expansion of the objectives of the policy aimed at concluding the internal market in Europe.For the internal market to result and prosper, regional disparities must be reduced.I am appropriate with the fact that as of the year 2000 it will be allowed to grant a help in the form of a 40% subsidy and a 15% supplement for fixed investments of SMEs to companies that are installed in regions of objective 1 in Europe.I have to remind Mr. Jonckheer that Irish or foreign companies based in Ireland continue to have to cross two seas to reach the continental Europe market.No other member state is in such a disadvantage situation.Mr. President, ladies, estimated and estimated colleagues, the prohibition of cartels constitutes the core of an operational competition system in Europe.The Commission considers unsatisfactory the way in which the supervision of said prohibition has been carried out in practice, which can also agree.However, opinions begin to diverge with regard to the solution.The commission's proposal does not formally depart from the prohibition of the cartels, but the result means moving from the prohibition with a reserve of authorization to the authorization with a reservation of prohibition.This is equivalent to moving from the principle of prohibition at the beginning of abuse.	es
"The report itself contains good intentions but, as is common when we deal with these issues, it suffers from clarity of purpose and a solid base for its operation.This is the reason why my group and I are proposing three amendments and additional proposals to the text, not with the intention of eliminating everything from the proposal, but of making it more relevant to those who have to carry it out.I would like to explain here what we think.First, we are concerned about the proper use of structural funds and cohesion funds.The past experience dictates that, as elected representatives of European taxpayers, we must and have to demand probity and financial transparency in the disbursement and audit of this money.Therefore, our amendments and additional proposals are related to achieving what we know as indicators of ""value in exchange for money"" in the process of granting aid.Secondly, we have seen too often that huge amounts of money are spent on projects whose results are necessarily inaccurate in the initial phase of the program period.But, also too often, at the midpoint or at the end of that period there is no real way to finish the project if its effectiveness has not been demonstrated.Therefore, our additional proposals defend the provision of practical output strategies and that can be enforced so that we can not only have the required insurance against the already acquired costs that are usually loaded to the taxpayer, but also avoid the well -known syndrome to lose more money when trying to recover the already lost.Finally, we defend the introduction of a change in the balance and the method of disbursement of the funds.There must be a greater commitment of the private sector, which must present the financial reality as an element of the funds.Also, the type of financed project requires away from small -scale projects based on income, which are difficult to supervise, towards capital plans where in most cases we can all clearly appreciate the benefits.In this way the so vaunted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to unnecessarily resort to the local tax base in the areas where these projects will be developed will decrease, and the European Parliament will show that the need for that reform is seriously taken seriously.If the Chamber supports today the introduction of these changes in the report, I believe that they will place us in a subsequent phase, in which the historical objectives that the funds must meet, that is, to help in a financially sustainable way to the most needy areas of the European Union whose standard of living requires an increase, not giving them alms, but a push.I ask the camera to support these changes.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Lordships, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for her report;It is arduous and conscientious work.There is no doubt that the structural policies and the cohesion policy of the European Union constitute the primary tools for the creation of the conditions that make possible the development and progressive elimination of economic and social inequalities between the regions;inequalities that, despite registered advances, remain at very high levels;Intolerately high, as regards unemployment."	es
I get scared and worried, because therefore, at least partially, the social exclusion stirs.It is not clear to me how you want to show solutions with such considerations.My question, which I repeat again here, is: What is the Portuguese presidency on the demands that, for example, make the networks to combat poverty and social exclusion, i.e. separation of work and social security, application of tax policy, especially to speculative financial capital, as well as a policy for redistribution of income?So I ask you to tell me what attitude the Portuguese presidency represents and whether it intends something in this direction.MP, they have to understand that the real possibilities of a presidency to reverse global social or economic tendencies in the six months of their work are effectively limited.It is probably completely clear that we are also very closely bound by the logic, which is based on the intervention of the Commission itself through its right to initiative.I spoke of the special summit of the European Council and the initiative that Portugal had to carry out, and I also talked about the future because there are two complementary approaches for this problem of social exclusion: One is the overall complex of direct measures that must be taken to counteract their concrete consequences, the other is the creation of the prerequisites for competitive ability on an international level thatTo perfect the economic structure within the European Union, which is associated with a positive effect on the problems of social exclusion.And that's why the Portuguese presidency has no patent recipes to answer questions in six months that have always existed.It is ready to act on all questions based on the Commission's proposals in these areas that fall into the responsibility of the community.Of course, she is able to promote all measures that are proposed, in particular on the part of the non -governmental organizations, but also within the framework of conventional intergovernmental cooperation in these areas.However, one has to consider, Mr MP, that it is not possible to work in an area with financially only serious effects with measures that can propose a presidency in a six -month period.That is why we keep all measures that we have pointed out in connection with long -term strategies - although we also know that some homeless people may have died after a long time, this is true - for measures with which sustainable policies can be guaranteed as part of the European Union.And we will try to contribute to these strategies as best we can during our term.Inquiry No. 12 of (H-0801/99): concerns: Portuguese chairmanship and development policy, can the acting president of the council present the priorities of the Portuguese chair in relation to development policy, the agreement of Lomé and the procedure for famines?I would like to thank the President of the Council for his detailed answer to my question and also express my position to the minister, who explained his position in Brussels last week in Brussels before the Development and Cooperation Committee.Nevertheless, not all questions have yet been clarified.In the present program, the fight against AIDS does not seem to be given a special priority.	de
We cannot help but wait for the extraordinary conference to also really meet the high expectations it has raised.Indeed, as you have already stressed, we do not need one procedure after another, one formality after another, but rather we need facts, according to which the population of the European Union can measure the utility and surplus value of the European Union's performance.For this reason, you have also ruled, rightly, employment, economic reform, growth and social cohesion and made them the main issue.It is important that all the actors of the governments and the commission pull the same rope in the direction of full employment.Then it will be possible to convince all the actors of the economic policy of the need to maintain a consistent conduct, which until now does not exist.Europe should not regret the success of the US economy or the strength of the dollar without extracting a lesson for itself.Surely the reforms of financial services, services capital and labor markets are useful and necessary.However, these reforms will not give growth the driving force that is necessary to organize at high level a lasting growth that has effects on employment.This we have had to live it many times in the 90s. In conditions of an average productivity increase of 2%, a 3.5% growth rate is necessary to achieve full employment within ten years.This has become very close.For this reason, full employment must be listed above all in the agenda.We must establish a growth objective of at least 3%.The objective of full employment cannot be achieved through economic policy only.Innovation Europe and information society must contribute to this objective.However, for now we are very far from this.We must also consider that we need another form of economic policy and economic praxis.It cannot be, simply, that shareholders or administration councils of corporations decide alone about jobs and economics, about the development of the quotation of actions.When after school the 13 -year -old schoolchildren play on the computer to modify the positions of their parents' actions, this may have more to do with a casino than with responsibility.I believe that the extraordinary summit of Lisbon will sit signs for an economic praxis responsible in the European Union.Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. President of the Commission, the Portuguese Presidency has presented an ambitious project for the extraordinary summit.Congratulations.I also celebrate support, which Portugal is receiving from the Commission, not ultimately through the communication that the community wants to make a society of information for all.To the Summit of Lisbon is also applicable what the Christian -democratic prime minister Jean Claude Juncker said about the summit on employment in Luxembourg in 1997: it should not be a literature summit, and thereby alluded to the numerous non -binding statements of many meetings at the summit.Through the Luxembourg procedure, the heads of government achieved concrete successes.	es
"I thank the rapporteur, Mr. Karl von Wogau, for his commitment and welcome the considerations he made.Furthermore, I would like to pronounce my recognition for that of Professor Tesauro, the President of the Italian Cartel Office, which Professor Monti will certainly take into account in a very cooperative spirit.The real problem undoubtedly consists in a stronger liberalization of the market and especially in the standardization of the various national markets, which currently have significant differences in a comparison between the English, Italian and French market;The French market is characterized by strong elements of state protectionism that do not exist in the English market and are extremely limited in Italy.Another problem is the economies of the countries willing to join, which run the risk of supporting support forever without gradual adaptation.In my opinion, a threshold should also be determined, below which two characteristic and important elements for our economic structure should be integrated, namely the SMEs that form the pillar of the European economy, as well as social protection that Europe has always granted to the economically weaker layers.The protection of the social function of the market is the distinguishing feature between a free economy Tout Court and a system that is used to improve the human quality of life.An aspect to be taken into account in the new legal provisions concerns the economy of the regions in an extremely outskirts and the island areas that must be preserved.Therefore, in my opinion, the creation of two foreign markets should also be considered, and fruitful relationships with Russia and the Mediterranean countries should be established so that the economies are less in an extremely outskirts.I wish - and in this regard, I would like to thank Professor Monti - that the new legal provisions are awarded a most widespread economic policy character and their social function is guaranteed.Mr. President, competition is the core and the strength of European internal market policy.A free open market can only exist thanks to competition, which is limited by clear, uniform rules of the game.Mr. Karl von Wogau sums up this in his report.But Europe is changing.The economies grow, soon we have 25 to 30 member states.The European Commission is overloaded with work if it continues to pursue current politics.Therefore, competition policy must be modernized.That is out of doubt.Nevertheless, the intended decentralization is worried.How will the Commission, as the guardian of the contracts, ensure that in London, Palermo, Helsinki and soon also in Budapest and Ankara by competitive matters?Legal relief must be avoided, and not the court that falls the mildest judgments may be flooded by competitive things.An indication that the Member States can look back on 40 years of experience is not enough.In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy.The country has a very small market, which unfortunately is often defined as the relevant market.Germany faces its extremely experienced cartel office that commands a gigantic market.The confidence of the European Commission that legislation is naturally interpreted in all directions, we describe Catholics as ""bold trust"", and that is prohibited."	de
"This symbolizes the need for solidarity with the countries of the South, in particular those of Africa, the Caribbean, of the Pacific, which have also questioned us in Seattle in this regard.To fully achieve its objective, the redistribution of the monetary mass released by such a tax must necessarily go in the direction of the poorest countries.In this way we make sense and moralization of commercial rules and solidarity with the southern peoples.Mrs. President, not only must we continually repeat the figure that many previous speakers have already mentioned but also must be mentioned, Mr. Commissioner, that 80% of these gigantic daily currency transactions do not have a duration of deposit of more than eight days.It cannot be that investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than the short -term operations of foreign exchange and actions.We cannot allow us to subtract the possibilities of political configuration or that income from a non -economic activity increases more and more quickly.Since Tobin developed his idea, in Germany it has been seen that the proportion of cash assets of 7.6% in all the income of society have almost currently doubled.It cannot be admitted that the poorest countries on Earth are the ones that are most intensely subjected to the speculative struggles of the short -term monetary oscillations.Nor do I think it is something impracticable.Why should it not be possible to reach an agreement between the G7 states, the other EU, China, Singapore and Switzerland states on the introduction of the Tobin Tax?There must be a general economic interest.Why can't it be practicable - because it is identifiable - that transactions for an immediate exchange of currency, all the so -called cash operations, currency operations and term options are subject to this tax?Why can't it be practicable to determine the amount of this tax in such a way that it does not endanger the necessary long -term economic investments but that finally makes those carried out in the short term and for speculative purposes?Undoubtedly, many difficult issues will be raised but the only big problem that I see so far is the political will and this attitude of going on responsibility from one place to another.Mr. President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr. Karas has pointed out a few minutes before.We are looking for solutions.Of course, capital markets need transparency that is the idea.The Tobin Tax will bring some clarity to a very dark issue.""The more progress is made towards the liberalization of trade, the more rules are needed,"" as Commissioner Lamy said during the millennium round held in Seattle.He acknowledged that the combined effort of the single market and the single currency that characterizes the process of construction of the European Union is closely linked to a huge number of new standards.Now that financing can be quickly sought through national borders without any difficulty, it will be strictly necessary to use the same approach, and the more if we consider that every day a huge amount of financial resources is used in speculative transactions."	es
Secondly, there is a lady who lacks thirteen weeks to retire and who is impatient to know the sentence that will seriously affect her financial situation in her old age.There are only two examples of real -life problems that hide behind the delays of the community judicial system.Delays in justice can lead to personal difficulties and even tragedy.This does not mean that all our national justice systems are perfect, but too often they are forced to wait for a prior judgment of the Court of Justice of the European communities.Statistics point to a worrying upward trend of time that take preliminary references.This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court of Justice or its personnel, but to its structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union.The proposals contained in this report are welcome as a provisional palliative, but Europe is a legal construction and its courts are fundamental for its proper functioning.With a view to the next extension, the Intergovernmental Conference should deal with a reform and a thorough restructuring of the judicial system.Otherwise, all of us, in our capacity as chosen representatives, will face each time the clamor of our citizens who do not have access to rapid and efficient justice.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report.In addition, I fully agree with the conclusions by him.Specifically, it proposes that the number of lawyers by judge in the Court of First Instance be increased and that said court be provided with an own translation service.It is something that I consider really essential since during the visit of the Commission of Legal Affairs to the Courts in Luxembourg they have told us that, as is logical and natural, the Court of Justice has preference on the Court of First Instance when it comes to going to the common translation service.The result is that on numerous occasions the issues processed by the Court of First Instance cannot be completed as it is.But on the other hand, I think that the reforms must go beyond what we are going to agree here.Thus, for example, I believe that we must consider the possibility of converting the Court of First Instance ultimately, granting the last word in those areas in which the sentencer bodies, which are similar to the courts, make a previous decision.It is enough to mention the word Alicante or remember that it is planned to apply this procedure in the field of European Law of Public Function.And it seems to me that we will probably also have to adopt measures before the European Commission's tendency to renationalize competition decisions, referring them to the national level.This issue is worthy of reflection since, in this way, these cases will no longer go to the Court of First Instance, but will be processed by the Court of Justice as remission resolutions.We must look for an exit to this situation.The case may also be considered the possibility of submitting remission resolutions in the field of competence to the Specialized Chamber of the Court of First Instance.	es
"I expect in particular from the Portuguese presidency that she takes advantage of the enormous work of the Finnish presidency to present proposals and coordinated action plans between the Member States.On the international level, action plans are already in place to fight scourges such as drug trafficking and money laundering.On a more human scale, however, many things remain to be done: firstly, help those who try to get out of the drugs and offer them adequate controls and mechanisms for their reinstatement;Second, ensuring coordination between police forces and judicial systems with regard to joint sentences and legal provisions;Third, carry out an information and awareness campaign focused on young people;Fourth finally, eliminate once for all these very dangerous concepts that are ""normalization"" and ""reduction in drug harm"" and show that any decline in our determination to fight against the legalization of drugs must be in the interest of all.Mr. President, I would like to take advantage of the few lean seconds of speaking time which are granted to me to report or remind the representative of the Commission that the Belgian government is currently carrying out a policy that will allow thousands, or even tens of thousands of foreigners in illegal situations, to be regularized and to be granted a permanent right of residence, the right to family reunification, etc.This measure of the Belgian government constitutes a blatant offense to the Schengen Convention.On December 23, I introduced a written complaint on this subject to Commissioner Vitorino.I would like to ask him to examine this complaint and to make myself known as soon as possible the measures that the Commission will adopt to sanction the violation of the Schengen Convention by the Belgian State, under article 226 of the Treaty.Mr. President, dear Portuguese friends and, in particular, dear representatives of the Council, you are faced with great expectations from us.By an example, I would like to show you how you can respond relatively quickly to these expectations, at least partially.This is Eurodac.You remember that in December, this European Parliament has decided, full of hope, that Eurodac should become reality as regulation and system, as a community instrument which we had an urgent need to no longer allow multiple asylum requests, to have an instrument against illegality and, above all, to establish in an undoubtedly establishing which a specific asylum application was.We have clearly spoken out in favor of this instrument, with an application committee and a suitable database established within the Commission.We thought that Eurodac had to come true.In Tampere too, we thought that Eurodac should come true.But as soon as the summit was followed in December, the Council has embarked on another path and took a new step back by deciding - which we have resolutely rejected - to maintain the execution skills within the Council, to add the Application Committee to the Council and to perhaps use Gibraltar as a means of pressure."	fr
From this point of view the issue must be investigated, because the instability of the Caucasus can lead many to think inadequately.Second, in terms of facilities security.In regions of a high seismic danger, it is not enough to have resistant anti -seismic buildings, because in exceptional cases, and I am talking to them as an engineer, we use models to investigate the consequences of some dangers.However, we cannot make models with nuclear facilities that are working.It is impossible.In this sense, in high danger regions, a priori, nuclear centrals are not built.Thus, as Türkiye is at the gates of the European Union, we must help her become a country of security, peace and collaboration in the region.This is our function and this is the goal of my question.Mr. President, I recognize the relevance of the arguments adduced by their honor.Actually, it is a very delicate issue.For the rest, as it will be understood, it is an issue that does not refer only to Turkey in terms of its proximity to the current territory of the European Union, but also to other states with which we have a relationship within the framework of our own closeness.We understand the concern of the honor and we will not stop taking it into account, in particular within the framework of the future contacts that we are going to celebrate with Turkey by formulating the agenda of the adhesion strategy planned for that country.That issue will also appear in the core of our concerns and the European Commission will not leave in any way take it into account.Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, president in the exercise of the Council.I am convinced that the president's president is a very pleasant person and is very affable with his wife and children and his dog.However, let me distrust somewhat from the answer you have just given us.I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately.Therefore, do you compromise, before the next plenary session, to tell me in writing where I can find this information on behalf of the public, immediately after the Council has adopted a legislative act, instead of waiting for it to appear published weeks later in a press release?Will you send me that information before the next plenary?Honor, first of all I would like to say that the personal comments with which he has started his second question and, if he could refrain from doing them in the future, would be appreciated.Regarding what the honor has said, we have an idea that the criticism made to the Council, in addition to being formulated in a very specific way and of which we also take note, does not refer to opacity - let's say so - of the legislative process, but almost an excess of transparency.But I would like to tell him, honor, that the results of such transparency process are, for us, clear and consider them unquestionable.	es
Since 1998 they are arriving at the Protest Commission in which it is argued that the port facilities will damage the Stegrennan coastal strip, which is currently part of the special conservation zone, and that the protection standards have not been met.After analyzing these protests during 1998 and the beginning of last year (the project did not receive financing during this period from structural funds), the commission, in the summer of 1999, was convinced that the port works had complied with the protection rules.A thorough study of environmental consequences was made.The most negative effect of the project, the loss of Stegrennan's coastal strip, will be temporary and the builders are responsible for the recovery of that girdle.At the request of the commission, Stegrennan's coastal strip was formally added in the special protection zone of the Boyne estuary, of which it had been previously excluded.To compensate for the negative effects of the temporal disappearance of the coastal strip in the life of wild birds, it was thought to improve other spaces suitable for the life of these birds in the estuary area.However, since last year, this measure has been questioned.First, the Irish authorities withdrew their commitment to make improvements.Subsequently, they renewed their commitment, after the protests presented by a non -governmental environmental organization before the Irish courts.The new commitment contained, however, small changes that, in turn, gave rise to new protests.Considering that Ireland has assumed the commitment to adopt compensatory measures and that other issues have already been resolved, the commission, for the moment, does not want to propose the freezing of structural funds.However, the Commission wants to study the compensatory measures of the Irish authorities, especially those related to the improvement of habitats, in the light of the still unfinished process before the courts of that country.- (In) I have not understood what Mrs. curator said.The Barrizal of Stregrennn, which was declared a special protection zone at the request of the Commission, has already been completely destroyed.It is evident that the activities that have been carried out there clearly breach the EU directives.You affirm that no more funds will be granted.I would like to know if it is proposed to completely suspend financing in this phase, until an investigation is carried out.Otherwise, why not?If it is proposed to suspend the financing, when will it do it exactly?Is it correct and adequate that the corporation that owns the company is also responsible for granting the license, as well as the one that basically receives the EU funds and delivers them to a company that is 100%property?Is that correct and appropriate?What is your opinion about it?The granting of any type of funds for the project must end, because it clearly breaches the community directives.Even the area declared by the commissioners as a special protection zone has been destroyed.Subsequent compensation will not repair the damages caused.	es
Unfortunately, nothing will change now and will not change anything in the future.They want to drive the devil out with the Beelzebub and apply the same fateful methods and the same economic principles to areas that have so far been withdrawn their responsibility: education, wage policy, direct taxes, labor law, social protection and social assistance.The most extraordinary in all of this is the fact that this policy of social mining is largely operated by left -wing governments of various stripes - pink, red, green - that preach social justice during the election campaigns, but take general social cuts as soon as they are at the top of the state.At this point I would like to reaffirm our conviction that without national and European priority and without the protection of our markets from the brazen global competition, no social policy and no policy of full employment are possible.When it comes to jobs, social security, family or pension policy, we must first think of the Europeans.The globalization of the economy you operate is neither necessary nor fateful.This globalization is violently enforced by the only superpower that has survived the Cold War and by the multinational corporations, which develop into independent business powers that submit to the states, nations and peoples who are unable to defend themselves.They make themselves complicit in this development.They promote this process, they are working on the disintegration of our social protection systems, despite their announcements, they create uncertainty and organize social reduction.For the European social model, this globalization of the economy, especially in the form in which it takes place today, could be fatal without taking into account the social and national peculiarities of the states.Your escape to the front into extreme liberalism certainly does not enable the solution to the social problems, the problems of uncertainty and the employment problems of millions of European Europeans.Mr. President, at the summit in Lisbon we will hear many nice words again.We will be happy to listen to these words, but you will not change anything about the basic problem: that we have an economic and monetary union that is more important to combat inflation than employment.The central bank has announced that the price increase rate must never exceed 2 %.The stability pact states that the deficit in the budget law may be a maximum of 1 % in normal years.On the other hand, there is no demand that unemployment must be lower than 5 % or - even better - lower than 2 or 1 %.It is more important that the cash prize and public expenses are not allowed to increase.It is conceivable that a country wants to combat unemployment with public investments, but that is prohibited.The monetary policy is said to be preserved as a holy cow, which is more important than giving the unemployed a job.It is more important for me that the family budget is okay that Papi receives wages, not the termination.That was the attitude of the Danish government, which was formed in 1993.In 1992 there were 9.2 % unemployed - in Euroland, i.e. in the 11 countries, and also in Denmark.From 1992 to 1998 the unemployment rate in Denmark fell to 5.1 %.In Euroland it rose to 10.9 %.	de
I will give you an example.In the report of the 1998 Court of Auditors, an error in calculation in exchange rates concerning Italian wine will have cost 8 to 10 million pounds sterling to European taxpayers.It is clear that it is unacceptable.What about the person responsible for the calculation error?We need a system offering bonuses and promotions and these promotions must be based on merit.We admit that most of the commission officials are major workers.But we also note that certain practices are obsolete.We are impatiently awaiting the complete proposal of the Commission on the Reformation and we hope that we will be able to settle the details together, since, contrary to what Mr. they have just said, the commissioner is committed to discussing it with the Parliament by March 1.We must also recognize that those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.The European Parliament has not always been very clear, in its approach, during its history.We must also go a long way before reaching perfection.Our personnel policy is herself obsolete.Some of our work practices should be radically changed.I hope that Parliament will remain in the wake of the commission throughout this reform process.We share the proposals relating to the establishment of the budget on the basis of activities.We admit that this presupposes discipline on the part of commission officials and we also admit that, within the parliament, we are responsible for the discipline when we speak of negative priorities.Finally, I would add that the Commission must revive its relations with citizens.European taxpayers should be reassured.The fate of the Commission and the European Union as a whole is based on the delivery of this reform.This is the key question is the delivery of these proposals.Mr. President, to start I would like to send my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr. Van Hulten, for his first report.I have a particular admiration for his courage, of which he did not depart when he was buried under the amendments.I believe that the Sages' report was useful, especially for Parliament - as Morgan said - and that we did well to ask for this occasion the advice of independent experts on how to manage our administration.We have filed an amendment on this subject.I would like to insist on some of the many points of Mr. Van Hulten's report, not according to their importance but according to an arbitrary choice.I think first of all that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper conservation of documents.The Archives of the Commission leave to desire.We found it when we had to investigate the Fléchard affair which has still not been clear.Oddly, very important documents had disappeared from the firms, even that of the president and various general directions, but it is something which, obviously, cannot happen.	fr
"Finally, I subscribe to the will of the European Commission to formulate an ambitious goal in the field of fighting poverty to drastically reduce this plague within a decade.Mr. Prime Minister, I believe it is essential to set a goal that challenges all Member States to fight against the social exclusion of all citizens from our society, not only of children but also their parents and the elderly.I wish the Presidency of the Council good luck in the realization of its ambitions.Mr. President, Mr. President in office for the Council, Mr. President, the Extraordinary European Council of Lisbon on employment, economic reforms and social cohesion will pursue, as we have seen, an ambitious, very ambitious goal, with the risk of disappointing our fellow citizens, aware of the fact that it is not enough to decree the full occupation and the eradication of poverty in Europe to make a reality.However, this summit has a not indifferent merit: that of defining, after Cardiff and Luxembourg, the political will to ensure a clearer social cohesion, in particular as regards the 57 million people who, on our territory, live in poverty: among them, single mothers, numerous families and children, to which other excluding still excluded will be added tomorrow, that is, those who will not have access to the new areas of knowledge,new social imbalances.It is therefore necessary to develop an economic and social policy clearly oriented towards the future, in order to prevent a gap, in terms of numbers, between ""accidents"" and ""infopovers"", that is, a digital fracture, as one of my colleagues has just called it.It is for this reason that, if on the one hand I think that new technologies represent a formidable integration carrier for our growth, on the other they can only be such if taught since childhood, since, by 2010, one place out of two will be provided by sectors directly connected to information technologies.In this regard, I urge to make three decisions at the Lisbon summit: firstly, a training strategy articulated along the entire span of life, with the launch of an order of works for the eradication of infantile poverty, both economic and intellectual poverty;Secondly, the establishment of the European Society, to the fullest of the European research space;Thirdly, the establishment of an open working and coordination method, based on our social and economic policies, with a concerted assessment of our national plans.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, there is an idea in the declaration of the Portuguese presidency that I like very much, and it is that the strength of our European economy is based on the skills, fantasy and creativity - in short, on the knowledge of the people who participate in the economic process in Europe.If we take this idea seriously and we really want to raise it to a political program, then the policy of social inclusion would no longer need other justifications, because social participation would in itself be the most powerful production force of our common economy.If so, Mr. Prime Minister, we have an urgent need for common objectives, solid and measurable goals - in a qualitative and quantitative sense - in terms of increasing employment rates, as proposed in the meantime, for example by the Commission."	it
"I do not believe that there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman.There is the question of the legislative base, on which we have advised well, and I think we step on firm ground in that regard.I want to reiterate that the deputies who, like the deputy who has asked the question, have a special interest in this issue, will want to maintain a dialogue about it.It is extremely important and I understand the concern of your honor.I want to thank the commission for something that I consider a very positive response.To be sure, I would like to confirm that there really is nothing in Jacob Söderman's proposal, in terms of the commission and good administration, which the commission finds unacceptable.Is it accurate that the content of the proposal will be approved in all its parts?Let me read what he says in my notes -and since he is in my notes it must be true!""I would like to emphasize that the commission has accepted all the recommendations of the Ombudsman contained in its draft recommendations in July 1999.""Both documents, that is, the commission document and the draft of the Ombudsman, largely touch the same points.The only matter of importance that has arisen is that of the legislative base.I can go into detail if your honor wishes, but there is no doubt that we are in complete harmony with the Ombudsman in this important issue.With pleasure we incorporate Mr. Patten's notes, as another head book that we will take into account the deputies.Since its author is not present, question No. 32 decays.I apologize to Mr. Vitorino for this parliamentary church, who regrets.It is exonerated, according to the regulation, to answer.I wish you very good afternoon.Second part questions addressed to Mr. Nielson, whom Mr. Patten replaces questions 33 and 34 of the second part of the question shift to the Commission had Mr. Nielson as a recipient.Mr. Nielson cannot be present today because he is in South Africa.I have to tell you that the vice president of the commission, Mrs. Loyola de Palacio, has sent me an attentive letter giving all kinds of explanations and communicating that Mr. Patten will be the one who answers these questions.Question Nº 33 Asked by (H-0829/99): Subject: Integration of the dimension of equality between men and women in the EU development aid policy in 1995 The Council of Ministers prepared the guidelines for the integration of the dimension of equality between men and women in the entire policy of the development of the EU.These guidelines require that all personnel working on development issues receive continuous training in terms of equality.However, so far only about 50 people have received such training, which still is not mandatory within the General Directorate in charge of this aid.The integration of the dimension of equality implies the taking into consideration of equality between women and men as an integral part of any policy, strategy or initiative in the field of development.To achieve this objective, the guidelines of the Council must be applied in its integrity."	es
This is the linchpin to ensure efficiency and security.We will create a management and control system in each general directorate.The control system is currently centralized;With the reform, we go to a control system in which the decentralization of administrative controls and an efficient central audit system are connected: We will therefore have a central financial service that defines and advisable the regulations for financial management;A decentralization of the entire chain, namely the programs, obligations, contracts, expenses and the corresponding ex-Ante control systems, will take place at the level of the individual general directors, and there will be an external audit service that will control all of these operations.This means a total change in the working method of the Commission, a completely new organization that also requires an absolutely new culture.We are fully aware of the problems associated with this transition phase, and this transition phase is also the most concerned with our staff: we will therefore take the necessary safety and protective measures.Because with the reform, the Commission wants to develop into an administration that is exemplary for Europe and for the whole world.We also want to be a role model for the advanced use of information technologies.We want to give an example of a completely IT-based administration.The Commission was accused of buried under Bergen of paper;We will therefore be a paperless commission, a commission without paper, so that we can become more efficient internally and contribute to the increased use of the new technologies.This means not only a technical, but a complete organizational change.I will now leave it up to Kinnock to explain this reform in detail, but not without thanking him beforehand for the prudence, the enthusiasm and the energy he used for this work.With him, I would like to thank him to those who participated in the project, as well as the entire Commission staff, who participated in this most comprehensive discussion process, which has ever taken place in the Commission.I would like to emphasize that this is an extraordinarily new method of discussion, which in my opinion also forced us to change a radical change in our way of thinking.The white book ahead of us is also the result of your contribution: You understood that only a profoundly reformed commission can again become the world's highly valued institution that formed the starting point for the history of Europe.With the acceptance of the white book, a chapter of the past - as I hope and wishes - is finally completed.Now we are looking into the future, the challenges before the Union and all the goals of the 2000-2005 program, which we have already explained here in the past few weeks before you.In these objectives of the five -year program, the deeper political reasons for the reform lie.We - the whole Union - need a strong commission, a commission that regains its ability to act as a political actor who is recognizable as such as such.That is why we now set all priorities that we have to concentrate on.Therefore - this is another important chapter - we get rid of such activities, the implementation of which is no longer appropriate for us in accordance with the decentralization and subsidiarity principle.	de
"At the 55th meeting of the Human Rights Commission last year, the United States decided in an already well -advanced phase to contribute a draft decision to China.This draft decision was brought down by a Chinese non -termination application.The European Union voted against this application.The position of the European Union on the attitude that the Human Rights Commission should take to China was confirmed by the Council ""General Affairs"" on March 21, 1999: No initiative of the European Union in relation to China and no support for a resolution of China, in the coordination of the non -interference application by the European Union.It is not certain whether the cohesion of the European Union could have been maintained, the decision would have been made to vote.The United States will bring a draft decision to China at the 56th meeting of the Human Rights Commission, and are currently putting pressure on the European Union so that it agrees to the draft.This triggered violent reactions on the side of China: Currently, the Chinese authorities in the federal states and the organs of the European Union are taking steps to prevent them from supporting the United States' initiative.This initiative is being discussed in the Union, but an early decision is not to be expected.It is in the interest of the European Union to keep all alternatives in the context of the dialogue between the European Union and China about human rights as long as possible, but in any case open until after the conference on February 25, 2000.In view of the changes that have been compiled in the composition of the Human Rights Commission, the vote on the non -arrangement application will be discontinued.Therefore, it is important that the countries of the European Union agree again this year the point of view they want to take in the event of a possible coordination on the resolution.In this context, it should be pointed out that the European Union regularly opposes the requests of China to automatically exclude the presentation of a resolution at the Geneva Human Rights Commission from the dialogue about human rights.The European Union clearly believes that the dialogue is a very valuable instrument to carry out an exchange of views and to learn about the reasons for the attitude of the other side that it must also produce concrete results on site.If this does not succeed, a resolution of the Human Rights Commission may be necessary, if necessary in the further course of the dialogue.In addition, the European Union repeatedly states that the human rights commission is the appropriate authority to bring up human rights issues and that the initiative - regardless of whether the European Union decides to support it or not - from this point of view.The next dialogue about human rights will take place on February 25 in Lisbon, and this includes seminars on legal questions and the rights of women, in which representatives from science circles and civil society should also take part.The next seminar on human rights will be carried out by the Portuguese presidency in May 2000.At the last dialogue round in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the technical aid offered by the European Union to support the international pact of the international pact on economic, social and cultural rights and the international pact of the civil and political rights of the United Nations that the Chinese government signed."	de
"These recurring disasters have nothing natural, they are also not given fate.They are the consequence of the human inconsistency.It is an ecological catastrophe.Only those who are very far away from the hard realities on site can doubt this.It is also an economic catastrophe for all those who live from the sea and tourism like fishermen, oyster breeders, mussel breeders, salt workers, retailers, etc. The Supergau of the Erika must be the last of this series.First of all, it is important to fully clarify the circumstances of this accident.Why shouldn't one use a parliamentary investigation committee or include the MPs in the mission that has just been announced by the Commission?Then we urgently need to issue legal provisions so that the exact characteristics of the goods carried out are primarily recorded.Because according to expert opinion, the oil on Erika would have had to sink to the bottom and could never reach the coasts.The consequences are known.It is also important to introduce reliable technical monitoring, similar to the technical monitoring of motor vehicles prescribed in France, which is older than five years.It is also necessary for regulations for the use of complicity flags, the demand for a double outer skin in ships to promote environmentally harmful and dangerous goods, technological innovations for the treatment or recovery of mineral oils at sea.That would be a minimum in my opinion at the beginning of the third millennium.Ships that do not meet the conformity requirements must be prohibited from driving on European waters.At the same time, the responsibility of the damage caused by the damage, the shipowner and the questioner must be determined according to the cause of the cause and the monitoring of the sea in order to prevent any degassing, enforced a serious and reliable control of the tankers, set up a well -equipped household line ""natural disasters"" for the member countries, introduced a special assistance of the community and the damaged departments as eligibleStructure funds are classified.In the name of the Edd faction, I brought a draft decision on this topic.President!In recent years, there have always been severe tanker disasters worldwide without any noteworthy or effective countermeasures.This time it is particularly bad, not least because it has hit a large European state, an incident that can repeat itself at any time.We urgently need a guideline to restrict these dangers.The 15 obviously are not enough.These guarantee - without entitlement to completeness - at least 3 points: No scrap tank tanker or freighter can ever start a port of the European Union more.All those involved, including the client of the transport, are liable for the consequential damage, and there are sufficient insurance from these involved.This is the only way to have a chance to get their claims for damages.However, it must be clear to us that the long -term goal must be stuck even further.This means that we need a real cost of cost for our entire energy supply system.Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Ms. Commissioner Palacio for her factual, appropriate and binding answer.Thank you very much.At the same time, your notification dated January 10 and the action plan announced by her today absolutely necessary.The disaster with Erika proves that if, when conclusive traffic and transport regulations are missing at international and European level, nature and the environment are missing."	de
These are areas in mutual dependence together.Economic stability is a growth factor and can translate into a high occupation.This also guarantees the possibility of increasing well -being.But the opposite is also true: a policy articulated on social protection can contribute to a high employment and to an increase in the growth rate.In other words, social protection is a productive factor.Within the Union there are differences in terms of social protection systems.Many of these have historical explanations.Now, however, we have a series of common challenges that await us.I refer, for example, to a demographic trend in which not only the number of elderly increases, but in which the number of births also falls.The labor market is also changing: women venture into increasing number on the labor market.A further challenge is represented by technological evolution.They are all challenges that we must face in concert.The communication of the Commission advocates a more intense exchange of experiences, the creation of a high -level group and carrying out a benchmarking.In addition, the social protection report in Europe will be published annually and will be examined jointly with the employment relationship.All this is positive, but that's not enough.We propose a procedure similar to the Luxembourg process.Chiari guidelines and indicators and Member States will need to define the methodologies in national action plans.A common model is created, but subsidiarity is maintained.This form of social convergence is a process destined to continue for a long time.This is why Parliament must be involved in the works and this not with the inclusion in the group at a high level, but allowing the representatives of the Parliament to follow the works of this group and to present proposals regarding the conduct of this process.Like the employment cooperation, the Commission's proposal stands on four pillars, i.e.: to make social protection systems more oriented towards employment, make long -term long -term sustainable systems, promote social integration, guarantee high quality health care.All this is important.In our relationship we have highlighted in particular the importance of combating poverty within the Union and identifying as soon as possible indicators that allow progress in this field.For the equality between the two sexes, an ad hoc pillar has not been foreseen: Mainstreaming comes into play here.Therefore, the aspects connected to equality must be present in each of the four pillars.For us this is a firm point.We present a whole series of proposals, for example the transition to personalized social security systems, the recognition of the validity of parental leave for the purposes of social benefits, better conditions for reconciling family life and professional life, minimum old -age pensions that still allow a dignified level of life.These are proposals that are mainly for the benefit of women.Parallel to this European social convergence strategy, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is needed and proposals for framework agreements in the social dialogue is needed, with a specific calendar.	it
The aerial and railway routes, those of the ferries and the lines that ensure the external and internal connections of the remote areas are contracting.The contract is assigned to those who commit themselves to providing a specific service at a specific quality level with the lowest subsidies.We can call it a negative contract offer.In this way, a competitive offer of provision of services is guaranteed, based on an assignment system with public, but transparent support.Why never could not be reported in a certain region in a certain region in a certain region, following these criteria?The offer that provides for the lowest subsidy would be awarded the concession for a certain period of time.Why could the small local office of a remote country be in contract following these criteria?It would therefore be up to the local administrative, regional or national democratically responsible administrative body - perhaps under the control of the European Union - establish the criteria and financial resources to be destined for this particular social purpose.Otherwise, postal services could be left to the mercy of all the requests and limitations of the market.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, is not a coincidence that I am the fifth Scottish deputy to intervene in the debate.This shows how important the question of postal services is for us.Scotland has a wider territory than that of some Member States and has many communities that live in remote areas, accessible only through the road network, sometimes poorly served at the level of public transport and sometimes not served at all.These communities entrust their survival to local services such as the school, the post office and the only shop.In particular, the oldest people rely only on the latter two.Often post office and shop coincide, and the supply of these two services depends on the existence of both.Scotland also has many insular communities: some can be reached by plane, but most of them depend on the connection provided by ferries.It should be considered that the current cost for the address of a letter from Edinburgh to the central Highlands is about ten times higher than that of the delivery of the same letter from one part to the other in London and is four times higher than the postal costs currently charged.This difference grows hand in hand with the distance of the remote area.Here is the problem.Ask that liberalization takes place in order to take into account these factors, allowing the maintenance of the postal service at a universal level and at affordable prices it does not mean opposing.It is for our communities of the remote and insular areas that we ask you to maintain the anchor of salvation represented by postal services.Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to replace Commissioner Bolkestein on the occasion of this in -depth debate on postal services, and I will try to respond based on the information provided by the colleague.I would like to remember that on Monday the Commissioner will be present at the meeting of the Commission for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.Some deputies, such as Mr Stenmarck, complain of delays in the presentation of the new proposal.	it
"The time of resolutions has already passed.Now what is needed are actions.Unfortunately, the Council will return - I fear - to stop acting and in the future we will discuss again on another maritime and ecological disaster.Mr. President, provided there is such a disaster, it is said that it should not happen again.Actually, we can never put an end to accidents that happen in the sea, but we are concerned with learning the teachings that emerge whenever such an accident occurs and apply them to reduce risks in the future.The ""Erika"" accident was serious, particularly for the most directly affected Brittany population, but was devastating for the fauna and flora of much of Europe.There are those who say that it is the worst accident that has ever happened to the life of the birds of this part of Europe.The real society for the protection of birds believes that nothing less than 400,000 birds, perhaps mainly, may have died.The photographs that many of us have seen of birds soaked with oil and that official veterinarians were sacrificing were a painful and tragic time.We all want the strictest rules for ships to be, whatever the pavilion that rises.We must impose compliance with the regulations and ensure that the principle is applied that ""the one who pollutes pays"" so that sanctions and financial incentives are used in order to press the owners of the ships and the oil companies and ensure that the best procedures are introduced.I agree with all the words that the curator has pronounced in her observations, but the question is: how long will it take to get the measures to be addressed to address that problem as she proposes?As a politician, he must remind his officials how difficult it would be to return to this Parliament within a year, if there was a similar, equally devastating accident, in case some of the measures he has proposed today continued, simply, being beautiful words and would not have had the opportunity to put them into practice.The idea that such an accident occurs in the near future must make your head and those of its officials concentrate intensely.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, I have brought a small gift: a heavy oil cake that has sent me an inhabitant of the island of Noirmoutier, who writes to me the following: ""With each tide, the beach is covered with heavy oil that escapes the Erika. With each tide, volunteers, military, firefighters remove immense cakes of this black tarThis devastating accident? ""Yes, this accident of Erika, like that of the Russian ship in Türkiye, is unacceptable and intolerable precisely when high technology is in all its peak.It is all the more unacceptable that it occurs twenty years after the catastrophe of Amoco Cadiz, although it had already been said and repeated several times ""Never again something like that!"""	es
We need solid objectives, established by mutual agreement, regarding the reduction of the unemployment rate to 4% in 2010, as proposed in the meantime, for example, also by the Commission.It is necessary to put an end to the logic of the Ecofin ministers who at home collect laurels for the successes achieved on the consolidation front, while the responsibilities for the huge unemployment in Europe remain wrapped in the fog.I wish you a lot of energy, the support of Parliament and I hope that there is a commitment so that this parliament, in the future, has more votes on the issues of economic policy and employment, as European citizens hope.He would thus find a further ally for his policy.Mr. President, Mr. President in office for the Council, Mr. President of the Commission, is rewarding and promising to hear in this classroom, as happened today, of this new strategic objective for the next decade which consists in transforming the European Union, in the most dynamic and more competitive economic and social space, worldwide, founding it on new technologies, innovation and knowledge, in order to be able to increase the levels of economic growth, obtaining an increase.improvement of jobs and greater social cohesion.It is clear that we must redefine the role of Europe in the world economy, creating competitive Europe, opening the way to the creation of new and better jobs, and organizing this evolution with a precise strategy of social cohesion.The central role of employment and social policy, at the dawn of this new society, is based on two factors.On the one hand, economic efficiency, since in this new technological context the quality of human resources is fundamental.From the other, social equality, because, despite the economic relaunch we are experiencing, there are enormous social disparities.Unemployment, social exclusion and the risks of a future imbalance of social security systems are problems that are accentuating themselves due to the inevitable challenges deriving from globalization, the aging of the population, from the technological progress, the demographic drop and the growing insertion of the woman in the world of work.Europe needs to achieve full employment.A full employment suitable for society that must be emerged, with greater possibilities for women and men.European citizens must be able to believe in this project and in this reality;They must not perceive it as something abstract, which is discussed in Brussels and Strasbourg.We therefore ask at this moment the transition to a new company, to an economy based on innovation, on the company of information and knowledge.It is necessary to learn quickly, create new practices more suitable for this new society, invest in technological changes but without ever forgetting people and institutions.The Lisbon summit will constitute a step forward and we must be able to renew the European social model, because only in this way will it be lost to the increase in employment and at the same time to greater social cohesion.To this end, it is necessary to focus on a series of priority themes: the effectiveness of active employment policies must be improved, strengthen the synergies between adaptability, education and permanent training, multiply the employment in the service sector by facilitating the entrepreneurial initiative and lightening the administrative burden that weighs on the small and medium enterprise by reducing non -wage costs - and finally the integration of the integration of the equal opportunities must be developedGenerals, with particular attention to the aspects that help to reconcile professional life with family life.	it
On the occasion of the last intervention of the high representative Solana before this parliament, I harshly criticized the fact that he had barely mentioned the concept of the prevention of conflicts;Today he talked for a long time on this issue, without however advancing any proposal to face him seriously.The ability to prepare 60,000 men in 60 days for a year of a year, but in our continent, on its boundaries and elsewhere they currently infurian currently crisis in which the union has given mensy proof of itself, has proudly blocked.We actually need a civil police force made up of 60,000 men and women to face these situations.The high representative Solana has not yet told us what pressures will appeal to Russia and Chechnya.He has not even informed us about the type of diplomatic intervention that he personally or the European Union are going to try seriously to stop the massacre in Chechnya.It is not even clear what are, in principle, our objectives in terms of human rights.We have somehow collected the forces to intervene in Kosovo, but now we are ruining everything because in that country we cannot put together the necessary resources and staff: in this way we are demonstrating our inability to create an adequate prevention of conflicts.I therefore ask the high representative Solana to clarify this parliament for the position of the European Union against Chechnya.What do we intend to do to end this tragedy?We have tools that would be effective with Russia, if we chose to use them;But for now we have chosen not to use them.Mr. President, High representative, Mr. Commissioner, I would have two questions to ask them, Mr. Solana: how do you think I can deepen further and in a credible way cooperation in the military and defense field, if the Member States are not willing to respect common commitments?The conferences are welcome, but then what matters are the results.I also wonder what she has in mind to convince the Member States to make this force of sixty thousand men a reality, and not just a figure on paper.If we look around, the reality we see is that of a PESS that risks being only chatter.Think, for example, of the defense cuts made in Germany, who do not only worry the Minister of Defense Scharping, but the whole of Europe.In my country, Sweden, the objective to be achieved in accordance with solidarity commitments is 2500 men to be allocated to union interventions.But our defense today is able to make only 1500 men available, precisely because of the budget cuts.By making a calculation on the entire union, truthful calculation if no changes will intervene, in 2003 we will not have 60,000 men, but 35-40,000 in the best case.My second question concerns the following.A few weeks ago, she was quoted clearly distorted by a German -speaking information body.I would like to know the background, and in particular if you, as a high representative, has really considered the hypothesis of treating Austria in her position in a different way from other countries;If so, I would still like to know who would have conferred this mandate and what his maneuver margin would be.	it
"As you know, these objectives aim to reduce poverty by half by 2015, either thanks to the increase in the age of compulsory education, or thanks to the significant reduction in infantile mortality, or thanks to a set of interventions in terms of social well-being which effectively achieve this objective.This would mean to retreat extreme poverty in which a third of the world's population lives, to retreat the extreme poverty of living conditions of around a billion people, which is extraordinary but certainly requires strong participation and a strong intervention of the entire international community.This is the fourth aspect of the new development paradigm that I would like to accentuate: development policies are envisaged today, in particular in recent years, in the form of an increasingly global question which suffers from a lack of strong international leadership.The concerted actions of the United Nations system institutions contributed significantly, as well as the ""Bretton Woods"" system.In particular, the strong pulses given in this debate should be recorded in particular by the World Bank, in particular through its comprehensive framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund.For the first time an institution of this nature places the problem of the decline in poverty at the center of its orientations and establishes a so far unimaginable connection on the part of such an institution between the alleviation of debt and poverty.It is also in the light of this new role that international organizations fulfill in relation to the development problems that we must reflect on the role of the European Union in this context.The Portuguese presidency insists on the need for the European Union to make its important role more compatible on an international scale, as the main donor, with a director and more active role in this movement to renovate development policies, internationally, by increasing its capacity for articulation and coordination, in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system.So that it is possible to strengthen the role of the European Union in the context of international development policies, we believe that it is necessary to fundamentally develop three types of actions.First, improve the efficiency of the development policy.As everyone knows, an overall evaluation exercise of development policies took place in 1995. It was possible to present the conclusions under the German presidency.The main conclusions emphasize the need for a more coherent policy of the European Union and a general strategic vision of the European Union in relation to development problems.They accentuate the aspects relating to the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between organizational harmonization and simplification policies, an executive in which the Union cooperation policy runs, and the need to make the management of aid more effective, in particular by reviewing its intervention mechanisms, as well as the need to strengthen the evaluation system and to ensure more transparency in the way of applying this aid.The second aspect that must be underlined concerns the need for greater complementarity between the Union and the policies of the Member States."	fr
"If she cannot do it, as some deputies have raised it, it is because she went to Hungary and Romania to see the extent of the disaster and determine how to best help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to cope with this crisis.We are willing to do so.At the beginning of this month, we came into contact with the Romanian government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube, in order to obtain more information about the accident.The Romanians addressed themselves to the FNUE and the BCAH in Geneva to ask them that an international team of independent experts assesses the damage in the Danube basin.We are willing to collaborate in this evaluation if Hungary and Romania ask us for it and if access to the sites for nationals of the two countries is guaranteed, which is obviously crucial.It is obviously essential to draw up a specific table of the damage as quickly as possible so that we can decide exactly how to react as best as possible.The efforts we provide today pursue this objective.It is also necessary to shed light on the legal responsibilities of the mining company and the Romanian authorities.This point is important, as certain speakers have specified.The principle of polluter pays is a cornerstone of the environmental policy of the European Union.The international convention for the protection and sustainable use of the Danube reflects it and it should be applied in this specific case.The European Union should not bear the cost of compensation due in place of the mining company.The Union has mobilized some 20 million euros over the past seven years to support the protection of the Danube basin.As part of pre-pricing aid for the region, it may be possible to redirect part of the aid we provide via the ISPA and the flagship program in order to face the most harmful consequences of this accident, as long as the principle of polluter pays are fully respected.We will have, in the longer term, to see what lessons we can learn from this disaster and see how to prevent above all disasters.This incident gives more weight to the arguments in favor of strengthening European civil protection, as the Prodi president recently said during a speech and as one or two deputies we specify today.But for the time being, priority is to face the crisis.As I said, my colleague, Ms. Wallström is there today.She will have to hold the Parliament fully informed of the actions she will offer following this visit.This is a real catastrophe for Europe and Europe must respond to it and do everything in its power to prevent accidents as appalling as it continues to spoil its future.The debate is closed.We are now going to vote.Votes.The only reason why we voted for the resolution of PSE-Verts/Ale-Gue/NGL compromise is that only this resolution allowed us to ""condemn the decision of the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its Italian factory""."	fr
Over the past few years, the community has spent about 200 million euros for smiling operations, assistance to victims and connected activities.Member States have spent similar figures.However, there is still an enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy defined with other members of the international community aimed at solving the problem of anti -human mines within a limited period of time.Commissioner Nielson reported the problems of the lack of concerted actions and the need for better complementarity with the Member States.These are problems that have been talked about for years.The Commission must change its internal organization, to strengthen the consistency and effectiveness of its interventions, if possible by establishing a central cell for the anti -maid action policy with adequate resources.He would also need more contraction and implementation procedures, a high -year -old balanced budget line and a marked improvement in the management of programs.It is necessary to carry out a careful assessment of the effectiveness of the gear programs in each of the countries seriously affected by the problem of terrestrial mines.In my opinion, the question of anti -human mines presents many of the organizational, procedural, operational and financial management difficulties that have long afflicted the commission and the union as a whole.Are they evils of the past or will we discover that in this relatively compact and limited area is the European Union still unable to make its aspirations?Mr. President, honorable colleagues, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new agreement between ACP countries and the European Union represents an important step forward in the direction of greater consistency.And it is positive that criteria such as human rights, democracy, state of law and good government are reiterated in this agreement with greater strength than it has happened so far and that most of our relationships are no longer marked by the old colonial model, but that these political criteria have assumed a more relevant weight.This is in fact the condition of any development.Without the observance of these criteria, development has no possibility of success.This, honorable Modrow, also applies to Cuba. I am pleased that Cuba approaches this process.However, some changes are still needed in that country.We all know the relationships of Amnesty International.It is possible that you have a different opinion than that of the majority of Parliament on one of the last bastions of communism and that it does not agree with the principle of good government, however it is an important criterion for the European Union.I would like to deal with a second topic.We discuss here of consistency.Many colleagues have proposed examples that highlight the absence of consistency in the different policies.However, from my point of view also the development policy as such needs greater consistency.It is not a sign of consistency that the coordination between Member States continues not to work, which sometimes in developing countries are carried out contradictory projects by the European Union and Member States.Furthermore, it is not consistent with taxpayers to conduct a development policy included in the union budget, while the European development fund remains out of it.	it
I will conclude, Mr. President, by affirming that progress is undoubtedly difficult, fragile, uncertain and that they demand on our part an assiduous follow -up of the different stages, punctuated by rigorous and meticulous control operations.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, I intervene to express the enthusiasm and the hope with which the group of the European Party of Liberals, Democrats and Reformors welcomes the opening of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.I sincerely hope that this agreement may, as the rapporteur is considering, Mr. Swoboda, serve as an example to extend as quickly as possible to other countries in the region, especially to Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Kosovo and, perhaps one day, in Serbia.We are convinced that the rapid opening of these negotiations and their fastest conclusion offer the only possibility of restoring peace in the region, this peace which has not automatically followed the end of the war in Kosovo.We will thus avoid reproducing the conditions favorable to a new disintegration and the return of chaos and violence, with all the risks that this involves for the stability of the continent, even from the planet.If it is true that the courageous current process of enlargement of the Union towards the countries of Eastern Europe is of deep motivation The maintenance of peace and security, such motivation must be even more present in our relations with Albania and the countries of the former Yugoslav Republic and, in all, it imposes that we are resolutely committing to the path of this widening parallel to the countries of southern Europeon exam.It is in this spirit, at the limit of provocation, that we presented an amendment to the transfer of skills concerning southeast Europe of foreign affairs to enlargement.The idea of ​​faster and more direct participation in southeast Europe in the life of European institutions has also led us to propose to welcome the European Parliament a limited number of observers sent by national parliaments, which would also detach members of their workforce to work with the Court of Justice and the Commission.Be that as it may, we are convinced that, to promote the evolution of the region to a more democratic society, essentially based on the market economy, we must without delay taking concrete initiatives to intensify the fight against corruption and improve the effectiveness of international aid in favor of reconstruction and development.It is for this purpose that we have presented several amendments hoping that Parliament will accept them.Firstly, it is a question of removing customs duties on the exports of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the European Union and of compensating for the gradual reduction of customs duties collected by Macedonia on European products, provided that the principle of customs control is accepted in the borders of Macedonia.It is a question, secondly, of bringing the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, thanks to adequate financial support, to gradually mooring its currency to the euro, as the first step towards a Europeanization of the Macedonian economy as a whole and with the subsequent objective of eliminating any perversion of the banking system.Thirdly, it is a question of giving the world's assistance and assistance in favor of the region a certain character of multilaterality, without imposing on the beneficiary country of direct obligations towards the donor country.	fr
"The aforementioned positions reinforce the question I address to Mr. Solana.Poland only needs five words to be fulfilled: nothing without us about us!What do current EU member states do before this reasonable request for a state aspiring to be a member?Mr. President, I would also like to greet the presence of the high representative and their availability to answer the questions of the deputies in this second appearance, because in their appearance of the month of November - certainly, not for cause attributable to Mr. Solana - it was not possible, although it is fair to recognize that he took note and that he promised to answer the questions asked by the deputies in the shortest possible period.I think it is also fair to recognize the efforts that Mr. Solana is deploying in order to have a more effective, more visible and more consistent common security policy of the European Union.And in this sense, I agree with the interventions made by some colleagues who have preceded me in the use of the word in the need to have a global policy that combines not only military elements, but also civil, diplomatic, humanitarian and also police elements, which Mr. Solana has referred.The Portuguese presidency has advanced a great stretch, indeed, installing a series of organs with provisional or interim character.In record time, he has organized this Informal Council of Defense Ministers and has indicated a whole series of pulls in the long march towards this common foreign policy.One of them has been this Sintra Council on which I wanted to ask Mr. Solana some questions.This advice has been based on two documents.A British document on the Headline Goals, on the priority objectives, and another document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union.Mr. Solana, I would like to ask you if you would be in disposal, in your next appearance in the Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy, to be able to explain long and tendent to the members of this Commission - along with Mr. Patten, to which the same question asked him, and with the president in exercise of the Council, to which I beg you, Mr. Solana, also transmits this request - the content of these documents that have been treated in the summit.A second question, Mr. Upper Representative, would be to know to what extent you support the observations and manifestations made by the French Defense Minister, in the sense that it was necessary for Member States to assign 0.7% of the gross domestic product to defense expenses.I would like to know what your opinion is, if you share that point of view, if you really consider necessary a more determined contribution by the Member States in this area.Thirdly, what assessment does the ""Crisex 2000"" exercises, which have just concluded, in which the European Union for the first time has shared with the North Atlantic organization a series of initiatives?And in the fourth and last place, Mr. Solana, I would like to know if, in the event that the Member States asked, he would be willing to preside over the political and defense committee, and thus add it to all the experience that you currently have as a moment as Secretary General of the Council of Ministers, as senior representative of the Foreign Policy and Common Security, as general secretary of the Western European Union and as former secretary general of NATO.Mr. Upper Representative, as rapporteur of the Foreign Affairs Commission on Security and Defense Avishes, I will limit my intervention to these issues."	es
This means that the proposal in question does not worry first of all to solve the problem of the circulation of these workers, but aims only to create better conditions for companies providing services.In addition, in the name of the simplification of the procedures, in the Berger report very questionable changes are introduced, including the establishment of a common information system that allows access to documents issued by the authorities of any Member State.Berger reports (A5-0007/2000) and Berger (A5-0012/2000) is with great satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals of directive that aim to facilitate the free movement of workers of third countries of third countries and, at the same time, the free movement of services.Essentially, these proposals introduce the EC Charter for the provision of services which, in the future, will allow about five million citizens of third countries, which legally reside in a Member State of the European Union, to provide services in other Member States.This possibility is currently hindered by problems such as the obtaining of visa and work permits.The first proposal of Directive authorizes companies based in a Member State, who occupy the city's city employees of third countries, to temporarily send them away to another Member State for the provision of services.In accordance with the terms of the provisions provided, the employer would only be required to request a service provision for each worker concerned.Obviously, to get in possession of this card, the worker must legally reside in a Member State and be ensured by a social security system.The second proposal confers the same rights to self -employed workers of third countries.If in essence I agree with the proposals of the European Commission, it is true that some provisions could appear ambiguous.It is for this reason that I vote in favor of the amendments presented by the rapporteur.This will allow to make the provisions clearer and prevent any possible abuse.Other amendments are aimed at simplifying administrative procedures, for example by authorizing the Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing the cards.A modification of this sort seemed to me indispensable to avoid the administrative slowness which, too often, brake the correct application of the new provisions.I can only rejoice in the adoption of these directives in their amended version.In fact, it could no longer be tolerated that people legally residing within the European Union collided with many difficulties.This contrasts with the fundamental principle of non -discrimination sanctioned in the treaties institutions of our union.Marinho report (A5-0003/2000).We nourish strong reserves on the proposals for the modification of the Council.How to explain that, just as you ask to increase the number of judges of the first instance court (which we know is overwhelmed with work), at the same time proposes to expand its skills?The effects of the first measure, in fact, would be canceled by the second.Some argue that perfection is not of this world, but a short historical excursus should allow them to better understand our reserves.	it
"Social security and social protection are one of the greatest achievements of employees in Europe, enforced in years of struggle against the efforts of major capital and thanks to the constant solidarity, as the employees are now.In today's Europe of unemployment and underemployment, it is urgently required to ensure further social protection and the expansion of the rights of employees.However, this requires a different system of economic and social development than the EU is able to produce due to its nature and its being.Summa Summarum we speak to ourselves against the ""modernization"" of the social protection system sought by the Commission with its communication and indicate that we will not agree to the committee for employment and social affairs for the debate.This ends the explanations of the votes.(The session is interrupted at 1:55 p.m. and resumed at 3:00 p.m..) Next meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission (continued) According to the agenda, the pronunciation of the Council on the Priorities of the Union for the next meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission (March 20, 2000) including the situation in China.President!I consider the absence of the reigning council president to be regrettable;It is about an explanation of the council, and I think that his participation in the continuation of the pronunciation might have been useful.It does not seem idle to remember that the inclusion of this point in the agenda is clearly due to the necessity that is expressed by all factions that the parliament carries out a pronunciation before the next meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva in order to be heard in a topic that is so sensitive to this parliament.I think after explaining the incumbent Council Presidency and the Commission, we can all match the fact that the current situation in the field of human rights is far from what would be desirable.At the Union's level, we cannot avoid that the situation is not completely satisfactory, because, for example, although the convention to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms is a common element to all member states, not all of their subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all states.A clear disadvantage in this area is also the fact that the European Union as such is not a signatories of the European Convention to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, with all the additional difficulties that this condition entails.I hope that all of these problems can be addressed and treated as part of the discussion, which is currently being conducted on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.At the level of foreign policy, I believe that most of the points recorded in our resolution convey a visual view of reality and do not exactly give rise to optimism, because aspects such as the abolition of the death penalty, which are still pronounced in many pronounced torture or the location of the minorities in many parts of the planet require a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union.In my opinion, the resolution contains a number of essential points, but I would like to go into particular on the need for a stronger coordination between the European Union and the United Nations."	de
"When we carry out intergovernmental conferences and rethink the treaty, we must take into account that the EU is extended every day, also contrary to the treaty, as we have just seen.I welcome the commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese presidency this afternoon.On February 14, the Intergovernmental Conference will be inaugurated that must end before the end of the year 2000. It is a great company, but it can be done.I think there is a general agreement here this afternoon among all the groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be enough to undertake the necessary reform that prepares Europe for expansion.In other words, we must go beyond what has been given in the important ""Amsterdam fringes.""These fringes include the extension of the vote by qualified majority -in my country we approve it, but not in the field of taxation -a new weighting of the votes in the Council to favor the largest states and the number of commissioners in an enlarged Europe.In relation to the last point, Ireland wants to keep his right to appoint a full and equitable member of the commission regardless of the number of Member States that adhere.We are willing to consider the new weighting of the votes in the Council of Ministers, on condition that the largest Member States accept that each Member State has a full and equitable member of the Commission.I think I speak in the name of many small countries when making this particular observation.The CIG should also discuss the possible division of treaties into two -in a political sphere and in an area related to the Constitution.We would accept the division of treaties on condition that it does not limit the control that the smallest member states have in the new negotiation of the entire political sphere of the treaty.In other words, if we are not fully represented in the Commission, we will not have any influence on political debates.Therefore we remain very attentive to the development of all that point.We look forward to the presentation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and know its content.The Amsterdam Treaty, Mr. President, established the number of deputies to the European Parliament in 700 and will be necessary to discuss in this Parliament the way in which that number will be distributed between an enlarged Europe.Mr. President, we must expand the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.The most important issue that must be included in the agenda is the internal differentiation of the Union.It is unfortunate that here in Parliament has not yet paid almost any attention to the internal disintegration of the Union, which, however, is essential for the extension of the union to be carried out in the agreed way.The former president of the Commission, Mr. Jacques Delors, has once again raised in the media the idea of ​​a European confederation.He has also said that countries that are at the head of integration, Avant Garde countries should be able to advance at a faster rate than others and, for clarity, should have their own institutions.The current president of the Commission, Mr. Prodi, and the high representative, Mr. Solana, have exhibited ideas that point in the same direction."	es
The commission, for its part, is ready to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot give up - besides you might be among the first to blame us - to check the relevance and the quality of the programs that are offered to us.Second remark, the time to submission to programs and the possibility of presenting a programming complement jointly to the programs.I have no objections to this idea of ​​a submission of a complement of programming jointly to the main program.However, this cannot mean an extension of the main time.I remind you that it is six months for this program.This period, which is also identical to that which we have granted for Interreg and for the documents of objective 2, should generally be enough, it seems to me, to establish a program, which does not prohibit that the projects are defined later.I would like, about Urban, to conclude with a last reflection.One of you wanted this urban dimension to be summed up in Urban.I agree.I myself said to the meeting of ministers of development, territory and city, my concern - and I use it - that, in the documents, in the CCAs, in the programming for which we start negotiations, my concern, I say, that the urban dimension is found outside of Urban, in all the programs of objective 1 and of objective 2, and I think I can say our vigilance but also the translation of thisApart from Urban in all programming of structural funds.But for the future, since it is necessary to look in front of us, I am extremely concerned with seeing how Urban will, concretely, to work, also concerned with seeing the experiences or the lessons that we can learn, because obviously this urban dimension will be in the curled of what could be, for the next financial perspectives, a new policy of development of European territories.I do not forget, we cannot forget that 80 % of European citizens live today in cities and that is why this Urban instrument is extremely important.I say it and repeat, we will be attentive to the presence of the urban dimension in all the programming of structural funds.I would now like, Mr. President, to talk about Interreg and thank, as I did for Ms. Arlene McCarthy, your rapporteur, Mr. Francis Decourrière, for the quality and relevance of his work.He insisted on several points, on which we mark our agreement and many of you too: the importance of this transeuropian cooperation, with its three components, cross -border, transnational, interregional;Interreg's community added value, its readability compared to the general framework of structural funds, and the actual strengthening, transnational of eligible programs and operations;The importance of common structures - what I have called, about another debate that begins today, the intergovernmental conference, the common spirit of Europeans that we must strengthen, here, with Interreg and thanks to Interreg, how to strengthen the common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programs with real financial solidarity;The importance of the partnership to guarantee the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as associations of the private sector and socio-economic partners.	fr
"Finally, concerning large energy networks, the guidelines also provide for a financial participation of funds to the development of energy transport networks when it contributes to reducing dependence on an external supplier or to fight the effects of isolation.This is worth, in particular, for the region that I mentioned in the Azores, but also for all the ultraperipheral regions and I will also add for certain regions handicapped by isolation due to the mountains, for example.Mr. Commissioner, I hear your answer, but on the other hand, if I asked this question, it is that we are worried, precisely, since within the framework of the report on the third framework program of research, is a project called ""International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor"".It amounts to several billion ecus, obviously, and areas that can obtain structural funds like those classified in objective 1 would be likely to accommodate this kind of installation.What we would like to know is so indeed, as part of the installation of this research site, and not, perhaps directly in the specific ""nuclear research"" framework, the commission would be able to finance this kind of project.Mr. Barnier, excuse me, but you have not fully answered the last part of my question on the major energy transport networks.Could you provide an answer on this subject?Do you worry if, with the structural funds, we will finance the installation of nuclear power plants somewhere?I schematize.We could say that there is no question.I told you, Madam MP, that the selection of projects remains the spring of the Member States, according to the regulations of the structural funds.Consequently, commission services are not systematically informed of all selected projects.However, you do well to wonder, it's your job, and mine to answer you.As has already happened in the past, the Member States are led to answer, insofar as the Commission questions or requests them.So, I will go a little further than the confidence usually shared between the Member States and the Commission, and on the precise point that you mention I will see exactly what it is.The Member State, or the Member States concerned, will then be brought to answer me and I will transmit this answer immediately.It seemed to me to have answered the question of major networks.The energy situation is extremely variable according to the regions of the European Union, and the help of funds, in certain cases and for certain regions, could be justified, in the case where the connection to the basic energy networks is still underdeveloped.This is the answer I can make on this connection between the major energy transport networks and the structural funds.I call question nº 46 of (H-0052/00): Subject: structural funds and additionality in light of the recently useful response brought by the commission to my priority written question relating to structural funds and additionality, I would like to know if the Commission plans to have the regulations change in addition.Would the Commission be in particular favorable to a modification of this regulation in the direction of the application of additionality, not only at the level of the Member States but also within them, being the applicable budgetary provisions between national authorities and regions or countries enjoying internal autonomy?"	fr
The identification of genetically modified additives plays a particularly important role here.On the one hand, it allows the farmer to consciously decide whether he wants to use such animal foods or not and it allows, on the other hand, the consumer to refuse foods that have been produced from GMOs.Finally, again, a big thank you for our group to the rapporteur, who gave himself a lot of trouble.I think we can be impatient to know Mr. Byrne's response.Mr. President, dear colleagues, this report is more for formal questions, namely how it is necessary to approve additives, and to a lesser extent, what additives it is and how they work.I must seize this opportunity to underline how important it is that all guidelines of this kind are processed, in the future, according to the procedure provided for in article 152, since food security and environmental issues require a coherent policy, a global perspective.We cannot continue, as we have done so far, to deal with every detail in the spot, and very often when harmful consequences have already occurred.The rapporteur has emphasized the experiences and labeling which the GMOs contained in the additives used in animal feed must be subject.I would like to evoke the question of antibiotics once again.Admittedly, five of the nine types of antibiotics whose addition to animal feed was initially authorized are now prohibited, but it is extremely important that the four remaining types are prohibited.Not only in the name of public health, but also for the good of the animals concerned.We are today at the stage where we know the formidable threat that antibiotic resistance represents for human health, especially for young children.Many Member States are already able to prove how the abusive employment of antibiotics in breeding is superfluous.Several countries have long eliminated this practice, a number of other countries are in the process of doing so, with positive results.Regarding antibiotics, it has been a long time since we went to the famous precautionary principle.In terms of environment, there is, however, another important principle, namely the principle of exchange.I would like to briefly mention the question of coccidiostatic.It is a technical antibiotic, which is not absolutely necessary.There are replacement methods.It is possible to vaccinate the chickens.It certainly costs a little more, but is without consequences for the environment.Today, we spread the slurry containing coccidiostatic on the fields, which goes into water, that is to say in the most important component of our diet.Mr. President, the Commissioner, my dear colleagues, the report on additives in animal feed relates to a technical-economic problem to restore competitive balance between different additives in animal food and between producers of these additives.But today, after the serious crisis of dioxin which struck Belgium and other European countries last summer, we cannot be content to reflect on a simple question of competition.Indeed, in its time, even if it has gone more unnoticed by the general public, the scientific experts of the commission had discovered in citrus pulp imported from the Brazil of industrial residues of lime laden with dioxin.	fr
Inaugurating an unfinished building in the middle of an election campaign, which could not be occupied eight months after the inauguration, has greatly ridicked the Spanish government.That the Spanish government has ridiculed me does not worry me because, in the end, it is responsible for it but that the commission was ridiculed by giving its approval, by its presence, to this inconvenient conduct, that worries me.This is why I ask you, Mr. Commissioner: does it seem normal that an unfinished building was inaugurated in the middle of the electoral campaign?Does it seem normal that the commission has given its approval, by its presence, to this inconvenient conduct of the Spanish government?It is not for me to comment on the internal political situation of one or the other Member State.I would therefore like to abstain from any comments on the situation that Mr. Berenguer has just mentioned.I must admit that the reason why an inauguration ceremony is set up in Spain escapes me.I can tell you that I hope that now, this building will come into office as quickly as possible.Let me add that I hope to be present in Alicante myself at the end of May in order to speak during a conference.I hope this building will then have come into office.I would like to tell the commissioner that it is not an electoral question.As members of the Legal Commission and the internal market, we followed the subject of the creation of this institution and, obviously, it is clear that this building was inaugurated for electoral reasons.Today - a year later - it is still unoccupied, which means that the commission spends money for a false inauguration.It should be asked to what extent this expenditure of funds for a false inauguration was justified.Again, the Commission does not deal with the considerations underlying the actions of the Member States.The commission takes care of what is officially declared and what is done.We do not intend to engage in what is called a trial of intention.We therefore take care of public and official acts and affairs and not any underlying reasons.This is why it seems difficult to me to satisfy Mr. Medina on this point and to answer his question.Again, the Commission does not wonder why something takes place more or less late, apart from the fact that the Commission attaches a price to the fact that a building such as that planned for this office is inaugurated and used as quickly as possible.In addition, the Commission does not take care either because of whether determined expenses are real or virtual.Regarding, all expenses are real.For the rest, it is the future that will tell us.Question nº 54 of (H-0117/00): Subject: monopoly of alcohol and internal market What measures does the commission intend to prevent Sweden from maintaining, as it obviously has the intention, its monopoly of state of alcohol and therefore, restrictions on the corresponding imports, so as to thus make the rules of the internal market prevail?	fr
"The fishermen's ices in Europe are faced with serious problems, and the well -being of the industry is really important to me.I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to collect the necessary information and to raise the political will for truly long -term solutions for the communities dependent on fishing and not to strive for short -term solutions.I recommend the report to the high house.The environmental committee is generally satisfied with the communication of the Commission, and we are pleased that the fishing committee has taken over our changes.In the meantime, it is widely recognized that the fishing has an impact on the sea environment, which go far beyond the mere fishing of the target type plus a little by catch and can be felt everywhere.We welcome the Commission's intention to include environmental protection in other policy areas - also in the common fishing policy - to the EU.After all, the contracts have been in the contracts since 1992 that the principle of prevention and environmental protection should be integrated into the community policies.However, as has already been determined, the adoption of a strict definition of the principle of prevention is of crucial importance, because mere lip service is all too easy and then continued ""business as usual"".In this context, a good example would be the UN Convention on Fish stocks from 1995. However, one aspect is missing in the message, namely monitoring and control.All reasonable measures and regulations will not lead to inventory if there is no effective system that ensures compliance with the rules.The Member States is responsible for control.A list of serious violations has recently been accepted by the Council, with which attempts are made to coordinate the punishment of similar offenses in the different countries to a certain extent.This is an important step forward, but commission and committee for fishing constantly point out that a lot of improvements are still necessary in the control programs of all Member States.I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent report.President!Fishing is an economic activity of the first rank, behind which there are very high investments and offers the entire regions of the community their basic employment under really hard conditions.But the idea that some people have from fishing is usually extremely simple and can range from pure folklore to the insult to see the fisherman as a insensitive pirate and looter.Unfortunately, I have to say that this report was apparently an opportunity for people with this kind of ideas for its connection with the environment to bring in their special nonsense.If Mr. Katiforis' report had been accepted in its original version, no member of the fishing committee could ever have put his foot in a fishing region again without having a certain risk.The relationship between fishing and sea ecosystems is obvious.But this relationship is much more comprehensive and includes many factors, such as pollution and maritime traffic.Only accusing the fisherman because of the environmental destruction is as unjust as it is wrong.Our committee prevented his own shame through a number of amendments, of which I myself brought 14, which were largely accepted by the rapporteur, for which I sincerely thank him."	de
However, if some of the amendments were approved, and in particular those presented by the PPE group, we believe that the report would be distorted and transformed into a contradictory document, without rigor;In this case, therefore, we will have to reconsider our support.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, among the various themes that appear on the agenda of this joint discussion I would like to insert a reflection on the theme dealt with by our colleague Berenguer, that is, the modernization of the competition policy to which the Commission's white paper alludes.I frankly believe that this modernization process has been satisfactory.Commissioner Monti is scoring good results in his own policy, like his predecessor, with the evident merit of having been able to guarantee, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, the correctives necessary for a regular functioning of the market economy in the Union without those side effects that, like us economists we know, risk producing when a market expands, as happened in the European Union starting from 1993.Everything works, if we are satisfied, if the commission line has been substantially correct, then why a change?In his support, various reasons have been adduced.Mr Berenguer has traced a very careful analysis, justifying the need for the modification and related reforms with the need to improve the functioning of the competition;However, what is most hearty is to ensure that standards and criteria applicable by the various competent authorities in the Member States are actually identical everywhere.Otherwise, we would find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: it would in fact be the commission to introduce elements of unfair competition in the functioning of the European internal market.In this case, instead of progress, we would have recorded a regression in the application of competition policy within the Union.Mr. President, I would like to express my gratitude to the Commission for the improvement marked by the XXVIII Commission of the Commission on Competition Policy in the Union with respect to previous editions.I also want to highlight the work done by the speaker, honorable Radkay, who has been able to analyze in concise terms a text as vast and dense as this.And he fully supports him when he affirms the need to leave the regions - like the Basque Country, which I represent here - a margin of action by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity.However, I cannot forget the criticisms formulated, on several occasions, both by the Member States, and by the market operators who, in the face of the large margin of maneuver and discretion recognized to the Commission in relation to the evaluation of each individual case, complain about the existence of a legal uncertainty, in the absence of rules of the clear game that allow the interested parties to provide for the position of the authorities and, therefore, to regulate themselves in the presentation of theThe obtaining of subsidies in support of economic activities and employment, in the mergers between companies etc.The only guarantee has so far been represented by the attempt to seek a favorable position for the authorization already in advance, presenting individual questions that however are not evaded in less than six to eight months, an excessively long term that is added to the obstacles that already weigh on the activities generating wealth and employment.	it
We tend to believe that this economic growth of the Union has a solid basis, now and for the coming years, and that we must not lose sight of the fact that we are in an open, global and very competitive economy.If we want to match the leadership of the United States, or even take over, we must avoid interventionism initially proposed by Mr. Katiforis, to avoid any excessive intervention on the part of the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures.In addition, the Member States refused to grant more resources during discussions on the 2000 agenda, so that in the European Union level, we will have only few means in the coming years.On the other hand, we insist on the need to continue to deepen the construction of the European domestic market, which still has serious shortcomings.In certain sectors, such as those of air transport, energy or telecommunications, the costs borne by our companies are still very high if we compare unit costs to those of the United States or other countries also competitive at the international level.The report contains information specifying that the bureaucratic cost for the creation of a new company is 500 euros in the United States when it is on average 1,600 euros in the European Union.There is therefore always an excessive bureaucracy and an excessive intervention.We believe that it is by respecting the rigor agreements which are established with the programs which follow the stability pact and by deepening the creation of a market with fewer obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness necessary for the European Union.Mr. President, dear colleagues, the passion that my predecessors recognized to Mr. Katiforis had, in my ears, no other objective than to call the European Parliament to meet the hope of tens of millions of unemployed, excluded and precarious in our European Union.It is this objective to which he called the European Parliament: to give hope to the peoples of Europe.There is economic recovery, of course, but it only marginally retreats unemployment in Europe.The voices of the PPE-DE and Liberals very strongly led to, even inverted, the meaning of his message.This is the reason why we have not voted the report as it was amended by them, despite our efforts, and we will not vote it in the current state.What are the minimum conditions we would vote for this report.First, the assertion that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, respectful in particular of the commitments of the European Union to the conferences of Kyoto and Buenos Aires.There are enormous tasks to be performed to keep our commitments by the 2008 fateful year where we should have returned to greenhouse gas clearances at the 1990 level. Huge works are to be carried out in the field of transport, the energy saving, and even to substitute travel by internet communications.	fr
