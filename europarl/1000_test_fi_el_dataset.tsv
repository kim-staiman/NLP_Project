In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be. That is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist. The Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign. Mr Corbett, thank you for your comments. I willingly accept your invitation. If I have understood you correctly, you want me, when I come to Yorkshire, to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds. I can perform this dual task. I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments, as I have already done, not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ. Ten days ago I was in Westminster, so you can see, Mr Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties. Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin. I have already appeared before the French Senate. Therefore, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will go directly to see the national parliaments too. With regard to the dialogue with our citizens, it is not a question of propaganda or marketing, nor even of communication. I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue. So, after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform, those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion. I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States. I sincerely hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate. Mr President, I should like to join Mr Barnier' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with. It is not much fun, of course, having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself. In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier said, during his presentation in Parliament, that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but, when I look at page 63, I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say, the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination, the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and, with a few exceptions, of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting. Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States' election processes? It is, of course, these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments. Can such matters be controlled from Brussels? Is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning?	fr
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology. I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala. Thank you, Mr Lannoye. I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative. Madam President, I should like to make a request in connection with today' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report. I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point. I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL. We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning. Madam President, to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made: Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane. I have a lot of sympathy with that protest. I have, however, no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity. I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane. I did not hide behind any immunity. I took the punishment that came to me. Mrs Lucas should do the same. Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow. In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee, and, given that it is a major Commission proposal, which refers to the agreements we reached last year, I consider it admissible. We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible. Does anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel' s request, as supported by Mrs Ghilardotti? If not, then we will proceed to the vote. (Parliament approved the request) Madam President, under Rule 29(4) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group. Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People's Party or does the Austrian People's Party continue to sit in that political group? Mr Corbett, I have not received any notification. Madam President, I am amazed at Mr Corbett' s reaction. He should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here. We are solidly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past. They have our full support. (Applause) Agenda With regard to the agenda for Thursday, following a request made yesterday in plenary, I propose extending the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance by half an hour to 6.00 p.m. when the vote will take place. (Parliament gave its assent) Commission's strategic objectives and legislative programme The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 2000. I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a five-year programme is an extremely important undertaking, and this is why I preferred that you be given the unabridged text of the speech, which is available in four languages. To respect my speaking time, I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme: a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century, when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective, a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation.	fi
The two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves. In order to change this undemocratic arrangement, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have tabled Amendment No 6 in which we request that the rapporteurs appointed to produce reports and consultative documents, together with the members of working parties, should be appointed in accordance with clear, democratic rules. In this context, account ought to be taken of the smaller groups, and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements. Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the quality of his report, which appropriately reflects the tenor of the debates in the Joint Assembly he so effectively co-chaired. The eradication of poverty was central to our work and many speakers highlighted the need to preserve an essential tool for achieving that ambitious aim, to whit, preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries within the framework of the Lom√© Conventions. The challenge was immense. Globalisation, free trade, and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy, were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue. So we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development, and personally I am convinced that the work of the last Joint Assembly did have a decisive influence on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations, as did the new climate created by the events at Seattle. However, while I welcome the renewal of the agreements, what I find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close. The European Union seems to me to have finally emerged from the old paternalist, or frankly neo-colonialist, logic where those giving aid are all too eager to start giving lessons, following a formula our friend Michel Rocard is so keen on. The Union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners. By refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool, in the hands of technocrats, for imposing new sets of conditions, the European Union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty. We have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events. What right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history, values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own? Personally, I prefer the willingness that is clearly flagged up in these agreements to extend the partnership to new agents - local authorities, non-governmental organisations - which seems to me to represent the only possible way the people of these countries can progressively achieve ownership cooperation. In short, this is the only way they can emerge from humiliating and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves, the proof of success. Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the accuracy and rigour of the summary in his report.	el
Fourthly, a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people. Fifthly, the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now. Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission. In relation to this, I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds. I should like to mention a few specific points. Mr Berend, you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly. Well, we are coming to an end of the zoning phase. Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy' s turn. You may therefore be satisfied on this point, since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by Objective 2. Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and, as Mr Cocilovo mentioned, there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data. To a certain extent, they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and, in any case, I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics. Mr Berend, you also mentioned, as did Mr Aparicio S√°nchez, the lack of reform in the fisheries sector. On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context. This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries, under Commissioner Fischler. Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns. Several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion, and your rapporteur mentioned some of these. I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy.	fr
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States' programmes? Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly? The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. As the EQUAL initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States, what will Greece's contribution amount to? The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people. Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace. The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin, where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action. This is an important aspect of this initiative. The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation. This is the same as the Social Fund regulation, i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation. It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament' s opinion next month. I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy. The Member States, i.e. the national governments, have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control. Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation, while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control, the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors. The last question concerns the amount granted. Greece has been granted ECU 98 million. The contribution commitment is 80%, rising to an 85% contribution from the initiative for the island regions, especially the remote Greek islands, and a contribution by Greece of 15%. Mr President, I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative, especially the four actions described in it, will result both in complicated bureaucracy and, paradoxically, a non-transparent structure. For example, one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity, as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines. At the same time, the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation, the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures, as these are the only structures which can meet such demands. However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic. Finally, if you consider the overall amount, which is on the small side, - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are, I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing. First let me say that it would be a great help to us, now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament, if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account.	de
I appreciate the fact that Parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services. I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way. I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs. I can therefore partly, and in principle, approve Amendments Nos 43-46, together with Amendment No 85. I believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector. This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured. I therefore support the overall thrust of Amendment No 105, which is in line with the Commission' s original proposal. I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources. We are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals. This must not, however, be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution. We intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question. I agree with Parliament that the common position' s sixteen-year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced. The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years. Amendment No 28, cancelling the third extension period, is an important step in the right direction. This proposal can therefore be approved. A period of ten years, as proposed in Amendments Nos 24 and 26, among others, is, on the other hand, too short. I believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided. The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water. This applies to Amendments Nos 6, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 78, 80, 102 and 104. These Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found. To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29, to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension, would be going too far, and these cannot be approved. Another important area is protection of the groundwater. We need both a starting point and a final goal if we are to reverse the upward trend in pollution. We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring. The most important parts of Parliament' s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle. The new definition in Amendment No 72 is, however, too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose. I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution. Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater.	de
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the European Union. Clearly, governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial, geostrategic or economic interests. We have established requirements for the countries which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support, because we believe in democracy and its values. A free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy. There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion. Yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted, detained, threatened or put under pressure. We rightfully condemned the behaviour of UNITA which threatened the peace process in Angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace. Rightfully and with the full weight of our authority, we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the Government of Angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society. Mr President, how much longer can we continue our cooperation with Angola? Human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time, not only by UNITA, but also by the government itself. The legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle. The Angolan Government must immediately authorise a substantial UN presence which can mediate and can report on human rights. Additionally, European observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists. Europe, as a major donor, has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola. If the Angolan Government continues to refuse to cooperate, measures will need to be taken. Without national reconciliation, reconciliation with Europe is not possible. This being the case, Angola will unfortunately remain a very rough diamond. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this House. The repression of both Angolan and foreign journalists in Angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment. However, this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that Angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them. Yet this is not the situation. Angola does not enjoy rule of law. It is a repressive dictatorship. It is at war, and a bloody war at that, which is dragging on and on. The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept. The repeated appeals made by the Angolan church and, for example, by Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki, for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this House. As another Member said, we must have a general debate on Angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country.	fr
Unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection, there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years, and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies. Besides, we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the Union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries. What has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the Danube and its tributary has been instructive. Consequently, I consider that support for environmental action under the LIFE financial instrument will help to further Community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfilling the Community' s mission of achieving a high level of environmental protection and improvement. Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment, ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening. Two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic. So I will simply appeal to the Commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue. For five years, I have been the representative of the Committee on the Environment in a regional organisation, which assuredly does not have Parliament' s broad perspective. The environment is in a parlous state. Like a number of previous speakers, I, too, wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects, which, in my view, should be incorporated into the pubic domain. As regards funding, EUR 613 million is not enough. Even EUR 850 million is not enough. At the end of August 1999, I took part in a meeting of the Committee of the Environment in which it was said that EUR 2 million, or ITL 4 000 billion, should go towards eliminating or, at any rate, reducing smoking. However, the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking. EUR 850 million - assuming that such a figure is actually agreed - believe me, is not enough, in practical terms, to allow any type of project to be carried out. In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established. But creating parks with very limited financial resources, without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual. I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the beginning of 1999, discussions have taken place between the institutions on the subject of the proposed regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment known as LIFE. I would again thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have had on this matter. As a result of this, I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	el
This would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by showing how remote we are from the real world. I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal, which was very well-balanced, stand unamended. Mr President, we are unable to vote for this report. The European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe. Social rights should determine economic choices, and not the other way around. This is why, when it comes to social protection, we are opposed to schemes copied from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale: broad economic guidelines, then convergence criteria and, finally, social issues, dealt with as the last resort. The European Union should proclaim one general principle, to wit, that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted. Any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator. In order to strengthen the funding of social security systems, we need a policy of general wage increase, the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State. In order to fight poverty, entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights. Finally, in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity, the European Union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system. I sincerely hope, in conclusion, that social Europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes. For millions of people the situation is too tragic for that. Mr President, Commissioner, the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the European Union is certainly an admirable one. Just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the Luxembourg Summit was commendable. The labour market and social protection are, in fact, two sides of the same coin, that require harmonised policies and rules. If the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment, flexibility and salary discipline, then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function, and vice versa. Until recently, the European countries fixed, it could be said in an autarkic way, the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets. Budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability. With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency, budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness. The structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot, therefore, be rebalanced through budget deficits and trade. That being the case, in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union, and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level, it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria, the so-called exogenous asymmetric shocks.	fr
"Support the Purvis amendments and the United Nations Gothenburg table of national emission ceilings. Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Myller for her report and her ambitious treatment of the directive proposed by the Commission. Even if the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy appears rather as if it had been caught napping and has only just woken up, the fact may, at all events, be conveyed that the problem of acidification is scarcely a new issue. Instead, it has been with us for as long as industrialisation - for 100 years. Research into the question has been going on for 30 years. None of us ought to be in any doubt about what the sources of acidification are, nor about what we should be doing regarding this issue. Some accuse the Commission' s proposal, and also the report, as being excessive and far too costly to implement and say that the calculations that have been made are utopian. This is, however, wrong because we know that the Member States themselves have contributed to the report which serves as a basis for the whole directive. There is more justification for criticising the fact that we have not included the energy scenario we have emphasised elsewhere, for example in the Kyoto protocol, and which involves burning fewer fossil fuels in order also to solve the climate problems we are facing. With all due respect to the Gothenburg protocol - and despite the fact that it has taken its name from my home town - I have to say that it is, in fact, just not on to compare this with the directive which we have to take a decision on tomorrow. One might well wonder why the Commission' s directive appears only a month later, rather like a punishment directed against this UN directive, but that has to do, of course, with nothing other than our own sluggishness in dealing with the issue. If we had been a little quicker off the mark, the present directive would have been on the table - signed, sealed and delivered - long before the so-called Gothenburg Protocol. The word ""impossible"" has been used about the directive. I should like to say, however, that what is impossible is the situation which we have at present. The impossibility lies, therefore, not in the directive but in the current situation. Mr President, my congratulations to Mrs Myller who I know has thought long and hard about this report. It seems to me that the debate comes down to this: do we believe that the Gothenburg Protocol was the best Member States can realistically achieve? I recognise that the Commission and environmental groups believe that in practice much more can be delivered but nonetheless some Member States have committed themselves to significant reductions in air pollution - though that is certainly not true of all of them. Some Member States seem to have gone into the negotiations with a few calculations on the back of an envelope and refused to compromise in any way to set themselves any realistic targets. Others have not even used the same methodology, the same basis of calculation as others. So the protocol in many ways is a nonsense. It can give us no confidence whatsoever. It is a messy political compromise and nothing more. I do not know how much more the Commissioner can achieve but we should be seeking reductions in air pollution and we should be giving her our support in her efforts to negotiate them. We should support this report and give her our backing. Mr President, Mrs Myller has produced an excellent report, and our group too thinks we should go at lot further than the Gothenburg Protocol on this. In all probability, drafting this directive was like a national auction, and the end result is very modest when we think what the real challenges are. But, in any case, it is important that the European Parliament should now defend at least that policy which the Commission has chosen. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposes that even stricter goals should be set for 2010 than the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has recommended. We want to emphasise that an integrated strategy must be adopted to reduce emissions. We have to remember that, in any case, we have the implementation of the Kyoto commitments ahead of us, which will mean insisting on more efficient use of energy and simply using less of it."	fi
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities, since they must be taken into consideration, under each of the objectives, to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions. I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made, ladies and gentlemen, and firstly on procedure. It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date. Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a draft in February 1999, in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text, my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, presented them to Parliament immediately. Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999. Here in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned, your observations will certainly be taken into consideration. And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account. Now to the form. On the subject of the role of the guidelines, Mrs Schroedter, you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives, often very precise ones, should be provided. I shall not list them all, but they include implementing intersectoral policies, increasing efficiency in the use of public funds, assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together, etc. The Commission takes note of these, but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents, such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document. Drawing to a close, I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated, Mrs Schroedter. I am thinking, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations. This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring' s negotiations. The Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations, which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad, indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies. I actually quoted the text itself, in quotation marks. Moreover, the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes. You then mentioned, Mrs Schroedter, the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development, pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.	fr
We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member. We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up. There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area. We will raise that, too, in the representations we make. A number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern, such as the effect on displaced farmers. On the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the Commission is participating in any form. Question No 39 by (H-0036/00): Subject: Drafting of Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century. What are the Commission's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)? Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?) Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda? What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes? What are the Commission's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union? Like the honourable Member, the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government to start the process of drawing up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In the conclusions of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even established the broad outlines of the Charter' s content. According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights. The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The second is the rights reserved for citizens of the European Union. The third is economic and social rights, as contained in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the Union. The Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given by the Cologne European Council. Having said that, this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources. As I have said before in this House, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances, particularly technological and social changes.	fr
That is absolutely crucial. It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women. Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children. Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today. Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves. What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides' surrendering power. The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden. Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark. And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark. In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland. We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing. I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources. It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term. In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated. The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures. One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments. I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures. In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up. There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally. The first is the issue of the media' s influence. I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish. Do we have a special problem in this regard? I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question. I have a suspicion that this is the case, but I am not certain. The second point is the enlargement of the Union. I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned. I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner' s statement; it is time that fine words were translated into action.	fr
Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it. The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South. Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States. If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities. Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation. The Union' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy. A large section of the Union' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots. Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented. Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union. The first is the fundamental, central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion. We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously. We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union' s fundamental objectives. Secondly, I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention. In future, we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as, in my country, the islands of the Azores and Madeira. I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament? Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made. Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes. However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas. Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities. I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.	el
This requires anticipation, timely preparation and careful management of these processes. Thirdly, nothing can justify the absence of timely, effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers' and employees' representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced. Worker involvement is always, and particularly in the event of corporate restructuring, not only a basic right but a necessary precondition for the social acceptance of such operations. In the end it is also a decisive factor of their success, as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust, dialogue, partnership and solidarity between its different components. These basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in Europe. This is what intelligent restructuring is about. It is more and more rare to see companies embark on damaging restructuring operations ignoring these fundamental concerns, as unfortunately was sometimes the case in the past. We have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the European Union. We have set minimum requirements at European level, which all Member States and all companies must observe when contemplating job losses, especially when they are massive, or preparing other decisions likely to affect workers. The collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings directive and the European works council directive constitute our legal framework, protecting the workers' rights and ensuring fair standards in the field of information and consultation at national and transnational level respectively. As regards the national and/or local level of employee involvement, the Commission wishes to underline again the need for proper information and consultation of employees' representatives before any redundancies are decided or implemented, as provided for in the collective redundancies directive and in other national provisions. I wish to recall that it is, in principle, up to national courts to deal with possible violations of these rules, if and when they are brought before them by national representatives. However, even when existing rules or arrangements are formally respected this does not mean that management' s attitude is socially irreprehensible. In fact, the Commission has argued for some time now that the rules we have established are not sufficient to deal with the challenges of today. In a world characterised by permanent change and in the context of high levels of unemployment, the rules in force seem to us to be outdated as they do not allow or promote the key ideas behind our employment strategy and our approach to change, anticipation, risk prevention and employability. That is why in November 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support. We thank you for that. Unfortunately, the other branch of the legislative power, the Council, has not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begun working on it. I hope that this debate contributes to reminding Member States of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative. We have recently heard from the Portuguese Presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched. The forthcoming French Presidency also seems willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserves. The Commission sincerely hopes that Parliament and the Council quickly finalise this important dossier which constitutes, in our view, the most effective answer to the concerns raised by cases such as the ones which brought us here today. As for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their European workforce. They may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force. The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this. In any case, I wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them, notably through relevant national jurisdictional instances.	fi
Mr President, we need to take an important decision today. Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer' s liability, that is to say that cars, once they have reached the end of their lives, are the responsibility of the car manufacturer? No, according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. 38: car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50/50. It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50/50 compromise is included that this does not work. Packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment. Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45. The common position stipulates 2006. According to the group of the Greens, this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations. I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists. If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply. The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic. This is ultimately cheaper, also for the consumer. For twenty years, the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener. Today, this green position is being threatened under pressure from, in particular, the German and French car industries. That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45. We, the Green Group, by and large support the common position. Mr President, the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area. With this directive, we have the chance to take a big step forward, but this presupposes that the Council' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament' s reading of it. If they were adopted, many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive. This applies, above all, to amendments from the Group of the European People' s Party but also, unfortunately, to some of the amendments from Mr Lange, as I see it. It is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries, for example in Germany, went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted. For ourselves, it is crucial that the following principles should apply. The polluter should pay. This means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility, financial as well as otherwise, for recycling vehicles. There must be rules governing existing vehicles too. Where this aspect is concerned, we cannot accept any weakening of the Council' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force. There should be no falling-off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years, and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead. We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations.	de
This is why, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange. These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints, since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States, and some of them work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate. Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector. Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive. Cars are also part of our cultural heritage. I think we would all agree on that. Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force. Parliament' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic. The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling. The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road. This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses. Like my group, I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel, offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection. Mr President, the European Parliament is today facing an important decision. Will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or, as the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others cause me to fear, will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry? The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake. It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection! The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious: to sabotage the directive! The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation. In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more. This is totally unacceptable. I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today! The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive.	fr
But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group: social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation. They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation. I think that it also a good thing if, moreover, the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001. I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group' s idea and we hope, Commissioner, that we can also count on your support. Finally, we urge the European Parliament, both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process. The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support. Mr President, the four chief objectives which the EU countries' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows: that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable; that social integration should be promoted; and that sustainable, high-quality health care should be guaranteed. These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them. Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from. The Commission' s communication, which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November, is a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union. We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets, which is a problem for many Member States. If reforms are not got under way, we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security. It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda. In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression social convergence. As liberals, we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies. It is not, therefore, about harmonisation but about common objectives. It is, of course, a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy. We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and, in spite of there being many points of similarity, there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned. It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern. National policy is, of course, subject to a number of common parameters. That is the case with minimum social entitlements, which are established by treaty.	de
That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure. The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments. We attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector, in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium-sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change. Dovetailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the EQUAL programme. We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme. The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators. This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has already been mentioned today that the first URBAN initiative was an unqualified success. The fact that this initiative will now be continued in the form of URBAN II, albeit with a smaller budget, is something for which we have to thank individual, committed Members of this Parliament, including in particular - as far as I have heard as a new Member of this Parliament - the rapporteur Mrs McCarthy, whom I should therefore like to thank very much for her dedication and of course also for her report on URBAN II. A new feature of the URBAN II initiative is that it has been tailored to small cities or parts of cities. This is important because it is precisely small cities which often find it harder to access aid. And yet the problems which give rise to the urgent need for regeneration can be particularly acute precisely in cities of this kind and thus have a proportionally adverse effect. To increase the effectiveness of individual measures the number of projects for URBAN II has been limited to 50. I think that it is important not to stick rigidly to this arbitrary quantitative restriction and instead to leave it to the Member States to decide between how many projects they each wish to divide the support funds to which they are entitled. In any case it is necessary to ensure that in small Member States in particular it is not only areas of large cities which are again in receipt of the support. There URBAN II would only be a drop in the ocean; its success would be doubtful and the whole thing would be a flop. Just as important in my view is not to broaden the selection criteria for URBAN II too much and thus water them down. It is precisely a strictly defined list of criteria which is essential if the programmes which are funded are to be models and be transferable to other problem cities in the future. From my own experience of local government in an old industrialised region beset with problems, I should like, in conclusion, to ask for your particular support, ladies and gentlemen, for two points in the report which alongside the social policy aspects are, I believe, essential. Firstly, environmental protection is essential for sustainable urban development and the inclusion of this aspect should therefore be a general requirement for a project to receive funding. Secondly, preventing and combating routine urban crime and crime related to drug dealing must start at local level. These are essential steps towards increasing the quality of urban life and must therefore also play a central role in the URBAN II initiative.	de
At national level, we are exceptionally keen that taxes on business and labour should be reduced towards the levels which prevail in our competitors' countries, but an issue such as that should be decided by the Swedish Parliament and not by the European Parliament. Through a situation in which different countries seek different solutions concerning tax and welfare policy, the opportunity is provided to adapt policy to the characteristic features of the individual nations and to test out different forms of social security systems. Tax harmonisation at European level should only take place in exceptional cases, for example in the cases of certain environmental taxes and taxes on capital. Even if we agree that a certain degree of tax harmonisation is necessary if the internal market is to function properly, Amendment No 4 is altogether too far-reaching and undifferentiated when it comes to this issue. Joint resolution on the shipwreck of the (RC B5-0181/2000) Mr President, we voted in favour of the resolution on the wreck of the Erika out of solidarity with the victims of this ecological disaster. We do, however, deplore the indecisive nature of the resolution. Confining oneself to deploring the disaster and expressing sympathy for its victims without applying some restraining measures in order to oblige Total to make good all the direct and indirect consequences of the pollution for which it is entirely responsible is tantamount to doing nothing. It is disgusting to see Total leaving the reparation of the damage it caused to volunteers and local authorities. It is equally disgusting to see the State releasing funds, inadequate funds moreover, which represent nothing more than a backdoor subsidy to this firm and its criminal dealings. Confining oneself to discussing merely the issue of flags of convenience is dodging the main issue. Whatever the flag of convenience used by Total, the oil company responsible is widely known and represented in all the countries of the European Union and the authorities concerned could, if they were so inclined, seize all of its assets until the company makes payment. We feel we must condemn, above all, this economy in which, in order to make extra profits, a firm can ruin a region with pollution in the same way that it can ruin a region by closing factories. Mr President, partly on behalf of the Breton partner of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Union Democratique Br√©tonne (UDB), I am asking for an effective policy to prevent further disasters of the kind involving the Erika. Legislation and controls should not only be tightened up but also applied to the letter. It was made painfully clear that a number of players need to be removed from the pitch in order to ensure that the Erika was the last unseaworthy ship to pollute the Breton coast. This is the seventh time that Brittany is having to deal with an oil slick since the Torrey Canyon shipwreck. No other region in the world has had to pay such a high price for the transport of polluting or dangerous substances by sea.	fr
Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that, in her report, she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes, which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now, to supplement and improve the text. It is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to spoil this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting - and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made. We have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it. So, in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting, to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions, the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do. We are also concerned with the question of cooperation. We need to define the precise responsibilities of the ECB, the national central banks, the Commission and Europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro. I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work. In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities. Aside from the report, which we welcome, many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved. I hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification. Mr President, Mrs Cederschi√∂ld, ladies and gentlemen, how safe is the euro? That is, after all, a question the people often ask. And that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 January 2002, the date when they will have euros in their pockets. For the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but, in fact, also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting. That too is a concern of the people, for, as has rightly been said, this will be a new currency for them, new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used. Of course all the citizens of the EU Member States will also be faced with the novelty of a currency that is valid over such a wider area, and even beyond Europe, as a reserve currency. They will need time to get used to that too. So it is clearly necessary to ask what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting. And that is what we are discussing at this late hour. This really is a subject that is close to the citizen, so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour. But that cannot be helped. Of course, the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time.	fr
In the age of globalisation, which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers, the European Commission cannot forget solidarity, and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man. Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart. We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, 'Shaping the new Europe' is an ambitious objective both for the Commission and for us all. Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries, but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union. What sort of impression will an interested public, as well as the rest of the world, have of this five-year programme? My reply would be: a new start, a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the Union in the 2000s will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously. The Commission is correct in stating that the Union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation. It foresees a just and more effective Europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self-interest. Consequently, we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom. I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document. However, there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work. The first concerns women, gender and women's rights. You talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth. That is important, but equality is not only necessary for productivity, but also to make our societies more democratic. It is therefore noticeable that 'equality', 'gender' and 'women' are barely mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'. You mentioned 'women' in your speech, but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals. Is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women? What other explanation could there be for omitting women? The EU must not take on a masculine persona. My other question concerns Africa, which is the only continent not mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'. Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world, the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic. I know that Commissioner Nielson and some of the other Commissioners are doing a fine job, but the rest of the Commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent, partly by including it among its strategic goals. Finally, I welcome the Commission's statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the EU is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets.	el
What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report? He proposed an ambitious report, based on an optimistic Europe, which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve. And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets. Why, for example, was the proposal to increase Europe' s active population to 75% of the total population removed, when we currently have levels of around 60%? An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries' levels of production with such a low rate of employment. We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive. As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training. We also need investment to grow at a faster rate. We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce. I would like to counter this with the example of Portugal, where employment laws are not flexible, and where unemployment stands at less than 5% - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing, with Community support of course, at a rate considerably higher than the Community average. What we want, therefore, is for Europe to enjoy economic growth, but also be prepared to address social issues. Mr President, like many others, I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report. When I read the report and see the picture of the EU' s economy that is described there, I think it is quite a worrying picture. Investment levels are too low, unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth. It is not, therefore, perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies, in spite of rumours to the effect that the European Central Bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it. The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself, which is something I agree with. There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development. As far as I am concerned, EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy. My conclusions about this differ completely, however, from those of the previous speaker. I believe we have to place our confidence in human resources, partly through a macro-economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly - and perhaps above all - by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training, democratisation and good social conditions. In this context, I can, in fact, see the EMU project' s main weakness, for it is true that you cannot act like Superman and raise the European economies from above.	el
I refer, Mr President, to point 38 and points 41 and 42 of the Haarder report. Point 38, which was amended for the worse by Amendment No 22, cited again today in the Chamber, imposes on Italy - and who knows why Italy should be singled out - in order to guarantee the impartiality of judges, not the separation of judicial and political authorities, as advocated by Montesquieu, but the separation, within the judiciary, of the careers of judges responsible for giving rulings and investigating magistrates. The consequence of this absurd step is that, as is the case in Italy, anyone who is part of the judiciary as an investigating magistrate will become dependent upon the decision-making authorities, with the genuine risk that it will not be possible to conduct inquiries into corruption and the abuse of political power without fear of political pressure. With reference to points 41 and 42, I appreciate the fact that no citizen, not even a male descendent of a former ruler, can be deprived of the freedom to enter the country of which he is a national, but I do not understand why this only applies to Italy and Austria: there are other Community States which have rulers and sons of rulers living abroad. In particular, with regard to Italy, to lay down a period of not more than six months within which to apply the sanctions would be against the Italian Constitution, which, in fact, provides for the adoption of a constitutional resolution. Mr President, the annual reports on human rights, racism and xenophobia give the House an excellent opportunity to make a critical or, to be more precise, a self-critical appraisal of the countries in the European Union. Candidate countries and their Members of Parliament, and I am thinking of many a member of the Turkish parliament, have a great deal to learn, such as how independent representatives of the people act and must act when it comes to human rights in their own country. We have to admit, however, that we still have a lot of homework to do. Self-criticism is not enough. It does us credit, but alone it does not suffice. Although, in our reports, we condemn cases of torture and maltreatment of detainees or prisoners by the forces of order or officials in charge of executing sentences, we must admit that so far little has been done about it by those in a position of responsibility. The same applies to the way in which many refugees are treated in many Member States. How many more times do we intend to debate the conditions in numerous detention centres as a problem of which we are aware but which has yet to be regulated? If we want to win the people in the detention centres over to our society, then we must admit that most European detention centres are not at present suitably equipped for the task. We are right to criticise human rights violations and discrimination in candidate countries such as Turkey or some of the Eastern European countries when it comes to the Roma and other minorities, but that is precisely why we must set an example when it comes to human rights in the European Union.	el
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century. Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere, culture or cooperation with the third world, excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity. Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy? We are convinced that the opposite is true, and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive. Excessive in comparison with what iron rule, what criteria of efficiency? Finally, after Seattle, do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO? Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness. Jonckheer Report (A5-0087/1999) I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU, and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report, and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information, both general and specific, publicly accessible via its website. I am happy with the rapporteur' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this. There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition. Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union. However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158). Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission. The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997, including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector. This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector). This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German L√§nder. Like the rapporteur, I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid. The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible. It must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time, which is to say in time for the ninth report. I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State. I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid. In order to compensate for this situation, the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us. I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous: the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another, with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU. This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment, industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries. Langen Report (A5-0073/1999) In the important debate on competition this morning, I expressed my views on Mr Langen' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code. Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996, the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation. Establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable, even though Article 4(c), of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry. This, indeed, is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code. At the same time, it is, of course, essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid. It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development, environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure. In the same way, it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings, as stipulated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code.	fi
It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments, in fact, the majority of them, appear to be downward adjustments, the remainder being improvements. The lion' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans: eleven restrictions and two improvements. In the case of unemployment benefits, we came across six restrictions and five improvements. The reasons for adjustments are, for example, to improve employment, reduce social security expenditure, but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria. Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries. The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries. All in all, both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole. This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches. To use a figure of speech, cappuccino is not always good for us. Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled. The European Union' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy. So far, social policy has remained limited in terms of set-up and resources. But under the influence of the free movement of employees, of the internal market and of the euro, the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated. This has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent. Cross-border workers, employees on secondment and migrating employees, as well as job-seekers, students on placement and other students, experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement. This is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection. In fact, the same phenomenon occurs in tax law. In order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping, the Commission has, in my opinion, developed a well-balanced approach which steers a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention. On the one hand, binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand, programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion. Based on a number of recommendations, reports and communications, the Commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high-ranking officials. Both proposals have already been accepted by the Council and it is thus a matter of endorsing this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time, with knowledge of all facts and/or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be reorganised in the European Union. Indeed, expansion, globalisation, a sharp increase in the ageing population, individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable. Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection. With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists, I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection. Indeed, if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition, this would also harm social protection as a production factor.	el
And therein lies the paradox. Political and monetary convergence in Europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems. But, at the same time, the single currency and the absence of labour mobility, as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy, force us into a situation of non-convergence in terms of salaries and welfare, in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels. Hypocrisy and fine-sounding words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernisation and concerted action are not going to extricate us from those contradictions. Either the European Union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources, genuine free movement of workers and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regimes, or it would be better not to deceive and be deceived by hopeless paths to convergence which sound impressive but which, in reality, only cause harm, above all to the most vulnerable. That is something we would do well to recognise. Mr President, unlike several of those who have spoken in today' s debate, I am inclined to endorse the Andersson report, one of the reasons for this being that I can see clear differences between the report and the Commission' s communications. In particular, I am referring to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the European social model' s approach, which is one based on solidarity. I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping, together with the right to a basic level of social security, the goal of social convergence, and, in particular, the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy. I can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state, model. All in all, though, I deem this report to be worthwhile. Mr President, I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection, which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe. This message is contained in the excellent report by Mr Andersson. Europe, the European Union, although it is very strong in economic and political terms, will remain shaky, weak and limited, perhaps inadequate, if we are not able to strengthen it from a social point of view. I believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it, but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged. Bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income, I believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the European Union. Let us not forget that, in 1999, 717,000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate. In social terms, it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain.	fr
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option. Commissioner, I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties, but I believe that, it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy, especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition. What is being done may well be very important, but it is still not sufficient. Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave. It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that. It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense. I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views. I also assume that you, Commissioner, want to honour the reputation of, and the work put in by, your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective. I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner, but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless. Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application. In general, I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market. The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application. It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way. The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities. But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward. So, I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible. Secondly, I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty. Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern. This instrument will fall by the wayside in future. In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next? Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy. I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection, as is already the case, one has got to admit, within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector.	fr
A5-0037/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on a financial contribution from the Community towards the expenditure incurred by the Member States in collecting data, and for financing studies and pilot projects for carrying out the common fisheries policy (COM(1999) 551 - C5-0303/1999 - 1999/0224(CNS)). The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome. So is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other. I understand that they have been some five years in their gestation. With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002, it is important that swift progress is now made. To take first the proposal for the Council regulation, this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations. Both biological and economic information are included. The proposal also makes provision for Member States to produce such data in aggregated form. Exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation. The implementing regulation will establish a minimum Community programme and an extended Community programme. It appears that these programmes will not cover the whole range of potential data but will be selective, for example, by type of fish stock. The proposal for the Council decision allows for the making of the financial contribution by the Community to Member States engaged in the collection and management of data. It also allows the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects. The only apparent sanction for Member States that do not completely fulfil the requirements of the minimum programme under the regulation is that they will not be eligible for any financial assistance in respect to the extended programme. Two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the Committee. The first relates to the degree of involvement of the Commission. The original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations. The Commission would only receive a copy of any such transmissions if it requested one. Since, however, the Community is funding the exercise, it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment. Thus, Amendment No 6, while maintaining the freedom of Member States to transmit the data to international organisations, requires that it also be sent annually to the Commission. This change is taken in conjunction with Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 7. Amendment No 1 clarifies the point that, although the data are to be scientifically based, they are being collected for wider decision-making purposes. Amendment No 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally. Amendment No 7 calls on the Commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation.	el
We must work to ensure that, in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally, the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords. It is true that economic aid is, in this respect, certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level. Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we, the Members of the European Parliament, must fulfil our own obligations in this regard, while ensuring, of course, that we are not the only ones to do so. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for his report. If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on. The Council' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret. The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should, and must, provide help swiftly, however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random. I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point, which clearly emphasises that it is only possible, and permissible, to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public, communal and other authorities and institutions, which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK. Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations, in particular Pillar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place. What is to be done with this money? I would like to highlight the issue of human rights. The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today? We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit. Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians. I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life. These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated. I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo. There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again. It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo. It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo. What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together. We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough. We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights. All of this needs to happen, and quickly too. If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise. That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available. Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary. . (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue.	fi
However, many of us feel we cannot realistically and sincerely oppose an agreement like the one before us today, primarily because we believe it will create objective conditions for further development and greater democracy and because, in addition, this agreement includes a suspension clause for non-respect of human rights. I also think measures can be introduced to monitor its effects at all levels, not just on tariff changes and so on. I am more worried about the points Mr S√°nchez Garc√≠a made: for example, that the agreement we are signing cannot be implemented because there are insufficient resources and services; that it will have perverse effects because we have not provided financial instruments for companies. So let us do all that and let us be vigilant about preventing what we want to prevent: the continued violation of human rights. Mr President, first I want to congratulate Mrs Ferrer on her excellent report, but despite that I also have to record that, regrettably, we cannot vote for it this time. Our decision has nothing to do with her work, it relates to the situation in Mexico. Three weeks ago I met with President Zedillo in Madrid and expressed our concern about the news we were receiving on violations of human rights in Mexico, the situation at the university and the situation in the indigenous towns of Chiapas and other localities. Mr Zedillo promised to let me have full details to prove to me that our concern was groundless. The days have gone by and still the information from Mr Zedillo has not come. Meanwhile, information is reaching us from many sources indicating that serious human rights violations are continuing in many places, increasing our concern. We quite understand that the economic content of the agreement is intended to bring about improvements, but we also recognise that we have not been able to achieve our aim of shifting the tremendous weight of North American influence that bears down on Mexico and other Latin American countries like a jackboot. Last time, we consulted with the parties on the left in Mexico on how to vote and we decided to abstain. This time we cannot even abstain, because the Mexican Government needs to be sent a signal - in friendship and solidarity - that it must be serious about respecting human rights, complying with the San Andr√©s undertakings and restoring democratic normality, as laid down in our democracy clause. Mr President, I will not discuss the content of this agreement since many speakers, including the rapporteur, have already covered it. I just want to highlight the political significance of the signing of this free trade agreement between the European Union and Mexico. First, from the strategic and political angles, it is important for the European Union to build up its relationship with a country that is so important in that part of the world and which, above all, is making progress in terms of respect for the values of human rights. Mexico' s membership of the OECD was just mentioned, and its observer status at the Council of Europe should also be remembered.	el
Firstly, proper port reception facilities for ship-generated waste have to be constructed at every European port unless it already has them. They must therefore be provided. Secondly, all ships, regardless of the flag they fly, have to dispose of their waste. Thirdly, the costs must be borne by the ship. We agree on these points. In fact, together we want to put a system in place so as to avoid there being financial incentives to dump waste into the sea. Firstly, we wish to protect flora and fauna and secondly, there are a large number of coastlines along which, on the one hand, tourists enjoy themselves and on the other jobs are to be created. That means that we want to have an effective system. So where do we differ from the Council, apart from on minor details such as the fact that we wish to exempt museum ships from the bureaucratic rules and that we are a little stricter where large fishing vessels and recreational craft are concerned? The really decisive difference is the issue of how the disposal costs are charged to the ship. Mr Bouwman has, of course, already explained this. There are two precedents. The first is in the Baltic Sea area, and this is not the experience of an individual state but the experience of the entire Baltic Sea area, and it says that if a large proportion of the disposal costs is covered by the general port dues then there is obviously no incentive to dispose of the ship-generated waste at sea. Surely if people have already paid the disposal costs then they will actually dispose of the waste in port. The other system is the pure polluter-pays principle: anyone who lands ship-generated waste has to pay extra for doing so. This second system has proved to be ineffective, otherwise why would the Mediterranean Sea be so dirty? Why would the North Sea be so dirty? Because for lack of adequate controls the polluter-pays principle does not work! That is why a broad majority of the committee - not a large majority; the representatives of the minority view will be speaking shortly - said, as Parliament as a whole did in the first reading, without any dispute, that the 'no-special-fee' system was the best system because it, as it were, offers ships a financial incentive not to dump their muck into the water when they are at sea but to dispose of it in proper port reception facilities. That is the decisive issue. We are prepared to reach an agreement with the Council. But so far the Council has rejected any serious agreement with us. That is why I call on the House to support our amendment whereby a significant proportion - up to 90% - of the costs have to be covered by the general port dues. This would give us the opportunity to reach an agreement with the Council in the conciliation procedure, whether it be on 75% or whatever. That is also why I would make the following request of the Commission: Madam Vice-President, think carefully about which side you stand on! I believe that in the interests of protecting the environment and of a permanently thriving tourist industry in many countries of our Community it is better to have an effective system. For these reasons support our 'no-special-fee' system. Perhaps then we will reach a reasonable compromise with the Council in the conciliation procedure. Mr President, I am pleased that you are the one chairing this debate because I know that as a Bavarian you always offer a sympathetic ear where ports and maritime matters are concerned, and I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, for the work which he has done and also for cooperating with us in the run-up to tomorrow's vote.	de
How would you describe this? What establishes a recognised minority? If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision? The Commission? The Council? And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this? What is the role of the scientific committees? What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up? Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way? These are my three questions. . Yes, Mr President, that is true. There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions. Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers? Well, that depends on who the legislators are. This is part of risk management. They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case. However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle. It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete. That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science. It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base. We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future. You have to see this as a tool for risk management. You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available. You have to assess all that and evaluate the science. Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not. So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today. Mr President, I have a question concerning an actual, concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle. It is about brominated flame retardants. It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered. There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment. There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks, while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are. Recently, both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants. I am wondering, therefore, if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative.	fr
"This certainly holds true for globalisation, which permits greater growth in wealth, international trade and productivity. However, unregulated globalisation, which is what we have today, or globalisation in which large sections of the world' s population do not benefit from significant investment in people, is also a factor in exclusion, in division and in widening the gap between rich and poor. This also applies to the knowledge society, which may give rise to a new equality of opportunity, but could also be a factor in the increasing gulf between those who have access to it and those who do not. This also applies to the relationship between the old and new economies. This is in fact not the first time that a technological transition has changed the social model and the model of economic organisation. At such times of profound change, problems, particularly those concerning employment in the old economy, have been resolved by turning to the new economy and its resources. To give an example, in Europe we have a textile industry. We must maintain a textile industry in Europe, but this will only happen if we are able to apply the technologies of the information and knowledge society. It is quite extraordinary that at the moment, in the so-called ""new economy"" sectors, there is a shortfall of around 800 000 qualified people for existing posts at the same time that there are millions of people unemployed. This means that we have not yet managed to use the resources of the new economy to resolve the problems of the old economy. We will never find solutions to those problems if we approach them with the mindset of that old economy. Lastly, I would like to answer a question that I have been asked, which is whether I am speaking here on behalf of 15 or 14 countries. The answer is simple: I am speaking on behalf of 15 countries. One of the things that the Portuguese Presidency has guaranteed is Austria' s full participation in the workings of all of the Union' s institutions. This does not prevent the Portuguese Government, and many other European governments, from being not so much in dispute with a particular country, as being engaged in a battle to preserve certain principles and values. Strangely enough, these very principles and values existed even before political movements such as the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats. I am talking about principles and values which come from the Enlightenment and which affirm the supremacy of reason. Because, if modern societies have one enemy today, it is irrationality in political behaviour. We could call this irrationality political populism, or excessive nationalism, or religious fundamentalism, or racism or xenophobia. This is a key issue: unless these values are respected, we may have a healthy economy, we may have jobs, but there will be no Europe. , Commission. (IT) Mr President, Prime Minister, just a few quick comments to close this debate, which has been lengthy but extremely important and constructive. Firstly, we are not starting from scratch. Anybody who may think that we have been too optimistic in this debate must understand that we are not starting from scratch. Europe has the advantages of the single currency and the single market to build on."	de
And more than this - and this is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive, that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require. It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded. My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of a long road. Following the conciliation stage, our institutions can now formally adopt the new 'Culture 2000' framework programme. We shall thus, in the course of the next five years, have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear, well-structured and, I am sure, successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector. It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this 'happy ending' in this House, and I thank you for it. I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process. I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, particularly to its rapporteur, Mr Gra√ßa Moura, its chairman, Mr Gargani, the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups, the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr Imbeni. They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution. Throughout the negotiations, they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time. We now have a framework programme, the first of its type for the cultural sector, and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive, but also more thorough and detailed manner. I would like to express my delight, with you, at this pleasing outcome. In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions, these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani has just said, that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment. It stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision, it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme, and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the Community financial perspectives. If need be, the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision, and this should be achieved by 30 June 2002. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a formal commitment, not just words on paper. All this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area, within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features, in all their diversity, but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them. It is thanks, too, to Parliament' s action, preferring a number of small-scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale. This is going to lead us to make 'Culture 2000' the programme of the citizen.	de
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has, however, adopted two important amendments. I welcome these even though, in my opinion, they do not go far enough. To tell the truth, I feel that this is not an acceptable compromise and that the use of vegetable fats has been made an acceptable commonplace while not giving consumers sufficient information, ignoring the problem of the analysis method' s lack of reliability, removing subsidiarity and complying with the requirements of multinational chocolate manufacturers, while ignoring the concerns of small specialist chocolate-makers and SMEs, consumer rights and the future of the millions of farmers involved in cocoa production. I am thinking in particular of the cocoa producers of West Africa, numbering more than ten million, whose future has clearly been compromised. Why should I say that when there is a proposed annex in the common position which appears to answer the problem? It is true that there is an annex restricting the list of permitted vegetable fats to six substances, which include shea nut butter, which is a product gathered in some poor countries of Africa, such as Mali and Burkina Faso. Unfortunately, this restriction does not provide any guarantees for the future. Firstly, it is in fact possible to manufacture cocoa butter substitutes without shea nuts, and I have no doubt that such solutions are being investigated on the grounds of the cost and reliability of the product. Secondly, there are industrial processes, involving chemical or genetic engineering methods, which make it possible to obtain cocoa-butter equivalents, using a low-cost base material which is one of the six permitted, i.e. industrially-produced palm oil with a market price ten times less than that of cocoa butter. By setting the shea nut producers, who deserve our consideration, against the cocoa-producers, the proponents of vegetable fats, with the support of the European Commission, and I deplore this utterly, are concealing what I hold to be the undeniable reality, which is that the only parties to gain from the entry into force of the text proposed by the Council in its current form are the multinational chocolate manufacturers, whose aim is to increase their profits by favouring cheap vegetable fats and intensifying the pressure to reduce cocoa prices. I therefore think that a number of amendments tabled on the initiative of Members from various political groups, particularly Mrs Thomas-Mauro, Mrs Ries or Mrs Isler B√©guin, are intended to re-establish the position which Parliament adopted at first reading and to give added value to the text. Let me cite, in particular, the compulsory identification of any vegetable fat content on the front of the product; the requirement for preliminary validation of a reliable analysis method; the principle of subsidiarity, which was removed by the Council even though it had been proposed by the Commission from the outset, the rejection of methods of genetic engineering and chemical methods - I would point out that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is in favour of rejecting the use of genetic engineering - and, finally, last but not least, a proposal for a serious impact study, which will not be carried out long after the directive comes into force but rather as soon as it comes into force, on the socio-economic situation of the cocoa-producing countries who are likely to be the first victims of this legislation.	el
Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time. I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy. I also appeal to the Austrian President, that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces. Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group, Francis Wurtz, reminded us of just now. I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes J√∂rg Haider' s party. The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because, as you know, we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit and the Member States' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans. Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today: this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational, neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary. This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe. We are talking about us, not Austria. We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe. Not only the Alpine region, but all our countries are involved: the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat. The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation. Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past. Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak on this, making the value of the presidency' s position even more apparent. This is the change we must impose on the Commission' s action. Madam President, despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, which opposes fascism, nazism or communism, both new and old, and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament. In the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party, there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms or the rule of law, enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties. I would, however, like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office, who has been so critical of Austria, has recently consigned the inhabitants of Macao to the sovereign rule of the People' s Democratic Republic of China.	fr
We must ensure that the main avenue for protecting rights is in the national courts and in a supervisory jurisdiction as exercised at European level. If we do not succeed in that, we will fail in everything. The conventions are, of course, concerned with the relationship between States and citizens and, since the EU is not a State, the fact that the EU increasingly behaves like, and is acquiring the powers of, a State is a problem. In that way, a loophole has appeared in connection with fundamental rights, and this loophole should, of course, be closed. In our eagerness to make things right, we are, however, in danger of doing a lot of damage. The EU is faced with a number of choices. Are we to secure our own rights? Are we exclusively to look after ourselves and our own? Or are we to reinforce human rights throughout Europe? The EU must not start competing with the existing authorities for resolving disputes, such as the Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg. That would, of course, weaken the latter and damage the situation regarding human rights throughout Europe. In my view, the EU' s Court of Justice should therefore be kept away from the project concerning fundamental rights. Instead, the EU ought to take Strasbourg' s judgements seriously and demand that present and future Member States ratify the European Convention on Human Rights, the ILO conventions and the essential UN conventions, as well as having economic and tariff agreements depend upon the parties adhering to these conventions. In that way, the EU would reinforce the existing conventions, and that is something there is a need for. I would like to join with my colleagues in congratulating the two rapporteurs despite the fact that I do not agree with everything that they have set down and suggested. At the same time, they have been given an impossible task to try and square a circle that cannot be squared. In the brief time that I have, I would like to concentrate on one specific point which the previous speaker has mentioned, as indeed have other speakers. That is the potential conflict which could arise between this Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights. Let us not forget that each Member State has ratified the European Convention on Human Rights, has incorporated it into its own national law and is bound by the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Over the last 50 years, the European Convention, with the decisions of the Court, has grown and evolved to accommodate new rights, new entitlements and new freedoms that have developed with society. Also, in case Members do not know it, under a strict legal interpretation any EU legislation supersedes any constitutional provision or any other national legislative provision in any one of the Member States. Therefore, if this Charter were to be incorporated into the Treaties, it would supersede the European Convention on Human Rights, it would supersede any national constitutional provisions and would also supersede any national legislative provisions.	el
Unfortunately, there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy, i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years. We know that lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made. Here, unfortunately, the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry. I am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicles. I found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and I am pleased that it failed, that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large Member State did not gain a majority, by which I mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the European Parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries. Madam President, although I too have spent most of my life in fast cars, I agree with my colleague, Mr Florenz, that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included. These splendid cars do not constitute waste. That is why I voted in favour of the amendments. Neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country' s statutes to another' s. In this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations. We cannot forget old car enthusiasts either, of whom there are more than 50 000 in Finland alone. They are involved in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance. - (SV) The parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing, to say the least. Before the vote at the plenary sitting, new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the Committee. In the divided situation which has now arisen, we therefore consider that the Council' s wordings are the best. We need a directive in this area, and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure. The directive concerning end-of-life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation. It is therefore important that the manufacturer' s liability should be clear. This should not in any way be jeopardised. Today, Parliament is examining, for the last time, this text on 'end-of-life' vehicles and what is to be done with them: their destruction, a commendable intention with regard to our environment. There are, however, two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text. First of all, who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction? We must all ensure that it is not always the same person, i.e. the vehicle owner, who pays. He or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle, which is a bottomless pit in financial terms. We have recently had cause to talk about the 'polluter pays' principle. We should apply this principle rationally and calmly, correctly targeted and without ideology. Another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vintage vehicles from its scope. One might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point, but I feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts. So let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry. These old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe, if we are not to water down each of our specific identities. There is no lack of examples amongst European texts, and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision. I only need to mention the case of Directives 79/409 and 92/43. The precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis. It is not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena. That would not be fulfilling our mission.	fi
The new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active Community support. Secondly, a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. In comparison with the current procedure, the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process, with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation. In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements, measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified. Thirdly, the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption. This is a real innovation, both in the EU/ACP context and in international relations in general. This procedure will be applied, not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money, but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development. It is thus not confined to EC activities. This is a very important aspect, taking into account the fundability of public finances. By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement, the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors. Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration. We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area. This new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999. The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions. The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration. We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration. The EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining, within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country, the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party. This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons. These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance. The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid. We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters. We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned. Negotiations will start no later than 2002. This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries' capacity to conduct trade negotiations.	de
We share with all the Basque citizens the sufferings of our people. We are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the Basque country. Twenty years have passed since the Northern Ireland question was first raised in this Parliament. May I ask: Quousque tandem - Noiz arte? Madam President, thank you for giving me the floor. I must say that it is very hard for me to follow on from the last intervention. When Mr Puerta mentioned some of ETA' s victims, he made no reference to someone who was killed by ETA 16 years ago. I believe he did this out of respect for me. The person I am talking about was a socialist senator who was also a member of the Basque regional parliament. His name was Enrique Casas. (Loud applause) Madam President, Senator Casas was my husband. I was left a widow with four children, the youngest of whom was only eight months old. My husband was an Andalusian by birth and a senator for the Basque Country. He had been sent by the Basque Government to defend the Basque Country in Madrid. His only crime was that he was a socialist and a democrat and nothing more. Madam President, I have never spoken of this here apart from on the day that ETA declared the cease-fire which I welcomed as a ray of hope for all Basque people and for the whole of Spain and Europe. This was the only time I had spoken of my husband' s death but I must do so again today and I do it willingly. Madam President, I was born in Germany, educated in Sweden and married to a Spaniard. I know what democracy is because I had the good fortune to grow up in a country like Sweden which has a long democratic tradition. I arrived in the Basque Country keen to integrate and, despite what has happened to me, I am convinced that some day the Basque Country will achieve the peace it desires. To those who believe that there is conflict in the Basque Country, I would say that the only conflict in the Basque Country goes by the name of ETA and must be eliminated. As for the other problems, we can talk about these. (Loud and sustained applause) We democrats can solve the other problems by allowing everyone to put forward their ideas, because freedom of expression, free elections and freedom in general do exist in the Basque Country. The only restriction on this freedom is ETA which must therefore be eliminated. Then we democrats can talk. (Loud applause) Thank you, Mrs D√ºhrkop D√ºhrkop, I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect. Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments? We are about to discuss the subject of reforming the Commission and you will recall, Madam President, that at the beginning of the last session, I raised with you the question of whether, in the interests of openness and transparency, the Members' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the Internet. You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening. I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and, if so, whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so. I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve. But we shall have a decision very soon. (The Minutes were adopted) Reforming the Commission The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission. I shall give the floor straight away to the President, Mr Romano Prodi. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission.	fi
It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish. As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts. The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes. The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects. There are some minor amendments: Amendment No 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to Member States can cover not only the costs of collection of data but also those of its management, compilation, aggregation, etc. Amendments Nos 3 and 6 aim to smooth the timescale given that Member States will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programmes actually involve; and also to bring the timescale into line with the dates and the regulation. Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority. More significantly, under Amendment No 1, the Fisheries Committee accepts the recommendation of the Budgets Committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1(b) rather than heading 3 of the Financial Perspective. Although in its preliminary draft budget the Commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 'Internal Policies' , Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion. This provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available. ) Mr President, I believe we totally agree with Mrs Attwooll' s statement at the beginning of her excellent report that these two Commission proposals, intended to shed more light on the scientific and socio-economic situation of the fisheries sector, come at a critical time. The proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner. This will only be true, of course, if the data can actually be obtained because, as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur, the Commission' s proposal does not establish any element of compulsion on the Member States. The sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance, which is not very significant anyway, will not be received. In view of our experience of the submission of data in the fisheries sector, as evidenced by the reports on compliance with the MAGPs, I believe that instead of obtaining a full picture of the situation in the sector, we will end up with total confusion. For example, some Member States will provide scientific data but not employment data while others will provide data on employment but none on the situation of resources, according to whether they can or want to obtain and send this data. I am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management. This has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory, as with the MAGPs.	fr
Hence the Commission supports, in principle, Amendment No 16 but prefers the wording of Amendments Nos 19, 20 and 21.  Concerning the duration of the regulation, our position has been to support an unlimited duration subject to periodic revision following evaluations. However we are aware that if unlimited duration were to be approved here, this would lead inevitably to a conciliation process. In this context we consider that the duration of seven years, proposed by the Council, is adequate and hence, in the interest of avoiding conciliation, we do not support Amendment No 18, which places an unlimited duration on the regulation. The final important issue common to both this regulation and the forest regulation are the amendments concerning bank guarantees. We concur with the view of Parliament that the Commission should not place bureaucratic barriers to the access of some NGOs to financing from Community funds. For this reason the Commission took a decision in July 1999 only to require bank guarantees for advance payments of over EUR 1 million. Hence the problem has, to a large extent, been resolved. Furthermore the Commission considers that such matters are best addressed in a horizontal manner rather than through specific regulations. For these reasons the Commission does not support the proposed Amendment No 10 on bank guarantees. The remaining amendments of the environment regulation can be placed in two categories: on the one hand, amendments which consist of reformulating elements of the scope of the proposed act or its means of intervention; and on the other hand, amendments concerning the management of the actions to be financed, in particular financial aspects. With regard to these two types of amendments, the position of the Commission is as follows. With the aim of finding a compromise solution which would make it possible to avoid conciliation the Commission could support Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, although it considers that they bring little added value to the text overall. Careful reading of the joint position will show that most of the concerns behind these amendments have been taken into consideration but following the structure of the regulation. The second type of amendments pose more problems to the Commission which therefore does not support them: Amendment No 9 - coordination with the local partners, as formulated in the report - is not supported by the Commission, not because of disagreement with the principle, but because the article in question is framed in the context of the Treaty which only refers to coordination with Member States. Amendment No 12 proposes the raising of the threshold for submission of projects for consideration by the Council from EUR 2 million to EUR 5 million. Given that most projects are already under EUR 2 million this amendment is considered not relevant. Furthermore we are concerned that its adoption would lead to a conciliation process. Therefore the Commission does not support it. The amendments on procurement and access to the markets - Amendments Nos 13 and 14 - would mean a departure from standard and carefully agreed formulations.	el
The fundamental point that we have to bear in mind here is that whilst Europe has made enormous progress in economic terms, as regards the single market and the single currency, nothing or next to nothing has been done in the field of justice and home affairs. We still have an almost purely national framework for justice, although certain situations are in practice clearly of a transnational nature. We constantly find ourselves having to deal with this contradiction, particularly as regards the rights of the child, an area where there are cases in which more than one country is involved and in which the victims are not only not notified by the state where the judgement is made, but are also deprived of legal support. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to thank you expressly for stating during question time that Austria has not been found guilty of violating Articles 6 and 7 and that, in the case of Austria, it is a preventive sentence. My question relates to the ad hoc decision by the Prime Minister concerning bilateral sanctions taken without consulting the foreign secretaries of the governments and parliaments of the states of Europe. All the European Union institutions were bypassed and presented with a fait accompli. Hence my question: what will happen in the future if we disregard the case of Austria now? Will the national Prime Ministers of the countries of Europe pass judgement in future? Will a majority of eight votes suffice or will a different majority be needed? In what way do the European Council and the European institutions lose power and the potential to formulate policy as a result? Is this a question of new competition between the European institutions and the national states? Mr Casaca, I can assure you that despite everything I am not pessimistic about the way in which the European Union has been progressing towards establishing an ethical dimension, and in particular towards equipping itself with legal mechanisms to enable it to cope with new situations such as the ones you have mentioned. When it comes to the development of the Treaty of Amsterdam, I think it is important for us to bear in mind that transfers of power have taken place, and that further transfers of power remain to be made over the next five years from what was the old third pillar to the first pillar of the Union, particularly as regards visas, judicial cooperation in civil matters and customs cooperation. We still have judicial cooperation in criminal matters under the third pillar, but at the moment we are working towards establishing a European area of freedom, security and justice, and we hope that the Commission can respond to this by presenting a scoreboard giving us a catalogue of pertinent measures. On the other hand, I would like to stress that the European Charter of Fundamental Rights that is being discussed will very probably help to strengthen these new aspects and will certainly help to give the European Union a more solid body of legally arguable principles, which some of us, and the Council in particular, would like to see.	el
As I have already said, the Commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council. This scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning. It will also, and above all, be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the European Union' s institutions towards the public. It is for the public, therefore, that we are developing the area of freedom, security and justice. The progress made will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council, nor even to the European Parliament, but to a combination of European institutions and to the Member States themselves, in as much as - as has already been pointed out here - specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity. In the coming weeks, I shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs. I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project. And we hope, during the Portuguese Presidency, to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council, taking account of the soundings that I have just mentioned. It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions, and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny. For this reason, and I believe that this is a challenge we are all facing, I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship, for legality and, ultimately, for democracy itself. In addition to the scoreboard, I would like to anticipate the following initiatives that the Commission intends to present during 2000 - and I would like to emphasise that I am delighted the Portuguese Presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom, security and justice as a priority in its work programme. I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, which is also the political message of Tampere, and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies. Regarding immigration and asylum, the Commission intends to present proposals for creating a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees; to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the Dublin Convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the Union; and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers.	fr
Mr President, we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate the sensitivity with which you are addressing the issue and your effort to establish contact with the Turkish Cypriot side, but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use did not leave one suspecting that you might be attempting some kind of indirect recognition, even though you stressed that this is not the case. For example, I would not refer to the government of Nicosia. It is the Cypriot Government, Mr President-in-Office, not the government of Nicosia. That government has proposed a way in which the Turkish Cypriot side can take part, and I think it would be right for the Council and the Commission to urge the Turkish Cypriot side to take part institutionally in the framework of the negotiations conducted by the Republic of Cyprus. On the other hand, the way that the issue of the end of the protocols and the pre-accession strategy has been addressed so far creates some doubts for us. I cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently, nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies. Nor can I understand the pressure applied by Parliament to include the funds in Chapter 7 for the pre-accession strategy. How can the whole of the European Union treat, in this way, two small countries situated on its periphery? Not only are they countries which the European Union needs, but they are also countries which are fully qualified to operate within the Union and are already considered capable of participating in economic and monetary union. As the Commissioner said, and I agree with him, it is a matter of political decision. This is a small political decision which would bring major benefits, especially in helping the two communities effectively to constitute one state, to achieve effective rapprochement - because the two communities were once close - and for the Republic of Cyprus, genuinely, to be rid of occupying forces. Mr President, we are required under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations within the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta. This proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and, once it is implemented, will replace the financial protocols which have now expired. Pre-accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the Community acquis. The Commission' s analysis has in fact shown that, although classified as high income countries by the World Bank, Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity. It was pointed out, during the discussion of Mr Brok' s excellent report in committee, that both countries can also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest. I would be grateful if the Commissioner could explicitly confirm that.	de
The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work. This involves both equality in accessing work, which implies equality in training, and equal pay for the same work, so often defended and yet far from being achieved. We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole. Women always have a different viewpoint from men. This serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us, who are dedicated to active politics, undertake to solve. The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making. In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women. However, this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men. Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent. The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women. There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women, who are ready and able, to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process. There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system. Some Members have even come out against this. Personally, I would not want to feel like a quota, to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman. This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference. Mr President, I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for good speeches on their part which I think provide hope for real optimism, especially given the will and commitment radiated by both women. I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women. It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear, what we are concerned with here. I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission - but then, of course, she is young and full of energy. I am convinced that it will be hard work, when all is said and done. If the Commissioner asks for support from Parliament, she can in any case count upon the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality.	el
In particular, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 6, 16, 21, 28, 31, 33, 34, 44, 45, 46, 48, 52, 53, 65, 67, 68, 75, 76, 78, 80, 84, 85, 88 and 102. The Commission can accept in part Amendments Nos 8, 18, 27, 29, 42, 43, 47, 54, 60, 62, 93, 94, 104 and 105. The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 30, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 50, 55, 56, 57, 58, 63, 69, 73, 79, 86, 89, 96, 99, 106 and 108. But the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 81(rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107. Thank you for your attention. (The President declared the common position approved as amended) Report (A5-0033/2000) by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection (COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution)President. That concludes the vote EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000) . (FR) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE. I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries, whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean, countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have, for the most part, been retained in the common position adopted by the Council. As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%). In my opinion, the most important amendments concern the following: LIFE' s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment, particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies, as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment; Improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE, procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public, and procedures for cooperation between recipients; The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere; The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation. I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe. The other candidate countries (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries.	fr
"We also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Iceland and Norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention to those two countries. The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and ultimately, in December, it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund. In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the ""communitisation"" of certain conventions. These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I), the convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (Brussels II), and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters. In 1999, we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the European Union, which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at Tampere. This communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime, in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation, including the cost of justice. We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment. In the field of European Union legislation on combating financial crime, the Commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering. In 1999, Europol took up its duties and we in the Commission, echoing the Portuguese Presidency' s statement today, sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam, there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between Europol and the relevant judicial institutions, and in particular Eurojust. In 1999, the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs, which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council. This list of actions, which is not exhaustive, should, here today, in the presence of the Council Presidency and of the Members of this House, help to make it clear that, while 1999 was a year of consolidation for EU action in this key area, it also - I very much hope - represented the start of a new phase, marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. For this reason, 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the EU' s institutions respond to our citizens' demands for guaranteed freedom of movement, with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection. In other words, 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council, for Parliament and for the Commission."	fr
And less social protection means less purchasing power, fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees. In respect of the super-Europeans, I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable. The discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions, rightful claimants, revenue or benefits, etc. It is thus impossible to bring all States into line. The path which the Commission is walking is, in fact, obvious. It has the advantage of clarity, and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid, comparative indicators and put forward recommendations. I endorse this view. I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter. Mr President, Mr Andersson' s report contains a lot that is of interest. Unfortunately, what is most interesting is that the report, which purports to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy, instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere. Social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States. Even though the socialists, now that there are so many social democratic governments, talk much less about unemployment than they used to, the unemployment in question is still high, and this in spite of the trade boom. Something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so-called European model into a parody. Social policy must facilitate employment, creating incentives for employers and employees to, respectively, provide and accept jobs. Mr Andersson' s report demands social convergence, that is to say that systems should be increasingly standardised within and throughout the EU. The EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria, which would be binding and of real effect. Mr Andersson also wants to see efficient and ambitious tax coordination, that is to say supranationalism in the fiscal sphere. The EU should also, on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty thresholds, table recommendations concerning what is called the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the Member States. The EU should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created, whatever that may mean. It is certainly not going to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulations and forms of interference. Those structural problems which make unemployment higher in Europe than in the United States will become even greater. There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area. The Member States can devise their own systems in the social sphere, each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences. It is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the EU. Mr Andersson thinks that the less wealthy Eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too. It is obvious, however, that these countries, impoverished within a Communist economic system, cannot cope with a social policy like, for example, Sweden' s.	el
A paper this short is a farce. A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand. A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard. It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard. We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme. What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand. We want instruments to prevent abuse. We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime. We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation, on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group. This is not the case in other areas, as has already been pointed out. We share these views because we are in favour of world trade, but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards, common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind. This aim is that trade should benefit development, and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world' s most dynamic and competitive regions. On the other hand, what does this statement tell us about principles? This regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation, in other words, increased wealth, but when we look at how this wealth is distributed, we see, unfortunately, that the gulf between the world' s richest countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase. It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves, what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve? What good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation works, if they cause trade to increase on the one hand, but on the other, they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow? That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission outlined here for the Seattle negotiations and for later ones. We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious. We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations.	de
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns, Mrs Peijs. Concerning Mr Evans' point regarding the implications for businesses, it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted. The purpose of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources. We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business. We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation. There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. This was raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs. Many speakers have underlined this. The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs. We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs. Why? Is this simply a political gesture? No. In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations, as in the field of vertical restraints. Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share. We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81(1). We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs, and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system, and secondly, by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which will benefit SMEs in particular. The fourth group is legal certainty. Mr Evans, legal certainty is, of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses, not just for the legal professions, although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe. Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a subject, the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market, including, in this case, competition. I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons: by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3), it will permit authorisation, without a prior decision, of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty. (FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers. Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982, as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof.	de
The free recovery system, for example, for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly. Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council' s common position definitely must not be amended. It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable. Mr President, like so many others here today, I believe this is a good measure. This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need. Most of the technical issues have been resolved. There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved. We have arrived at the final question. In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament. That is quite simply: Who pays? The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost, not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said. In fact perhaps as little, the lawyers tell us, as 20% or one-fifth of the cost. That is not unreasonable. If you look at the UK consumer for example, who buys a Rover, as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars, over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should they pay? They have paid already. Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers, pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from? I cannot accept that. There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case. I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it. The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer. It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal. The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government. The common position is a reasonable compromise. Some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road. I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments. Mr President, there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life cars, although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy. It is disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter. Firstly, Herr Trittin, the Environment Minister, was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet, then Chancellor Schr√∂der blundered in like a bull in a china shop, having no expert knowledge of this process.	fr
I support the enlargement of the Union, but such a process cannot take place until key EU institutions, including the Commission, the Council, and of course Parliament, reform their internal decision-making operations. As a Member of the Parliament from the constituency of Connaught Ulster in Ireland, a peripheral part of this Union, I strongly believe in real and tangible representation for smaller Member States within the EU structures. At present, the five larger Member States have two posts within the European Commission and there is one each for the smaller Member States. Whatever the reform, it is vitally important that smaller Member States retain their right to nominate a Member of the Commission. Undoubtedly, the European Council, representing the fifteen governments, will have to reform its structures. From an Irish perspective, I strongly believe that Member State governments must have a veto over tax changes at EU level. No changes at present can be agreed at EU level concerning tax policies without the unanimous support of all EU Member States. I believe this is an important right, which should be left in the domain of national Member States. In my own country, the tax regime is quite innovative in many ways. The tax burden on middle and lower income workers has been steadily reduced, while sensible tax breaks have been given to encourage business enterprises. This cannot be said of many of the other Member States. Any proposal to give the European Council the power of qualified majority voting on justice and home affairs would be, I believe, very unwise. In conclusion, can I say that I am very pleased that the President has, this morning, referred to fisheries. He said he believes it is lagging behind - that real progress must be made in the year 2002, because fisheries are established in areas where there is no alternative source of employment. Of course we want to ensure by the year 2002 that the countries that suffered most when the common fisheries policy was put in place in 1983 will in future receive a fair and equitable share of the resources. In conclusion, can I say that on a broader level it is important that the European Union, as an economic entity, does not fall behind in the global search for e-commerce opportunities. The Commission must support educational and training programmes, to ensure that business structures take account of the opportunities which can be secured from the Internet and e-commerce in general. An information technology revolution is certainly upon us. We cannot be passengers when these changes take place. We must be leaders of our business communities and of our educational institutions, so that information technology initiatives are incorporated into all key social and economic sectors of our society. Mr President, Mr Prodi' s Commission will not last for five years because people will not, in the longer term, put up with detailed regulation from Brussels. It is perhaps difficult to know who is going to provide the salutary shock, and when.	el
However, more work is needed on this. Mr President, may I commence by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on his report. It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality. The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health. The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future, for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform. But even in this crucial area of administration, Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility. In Agenda 2000, we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens: food safety, water quality, environmental protection and rural development. If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence, the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs. I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds. Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely. I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety, Mr Byrne. He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House, as well as to the concern of consumers. I am particularly pleased that my own country, Ireland, is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability. This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production. Mr President, Commissioner, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group. It is therefore specified that, through the adoption of a regulation, the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation. This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question. A coherent legal framework must be re-established. As of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70/524/EEC for the replacement of the authorisations. However, we must ensure that competition distortions are not created, as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi. Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this. The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision. This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget. There must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety. I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	el
There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that, after a few months, a police force is needed rather than a military force. Then, in the final moments of the crisis, it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police. In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission. I am not going to say much more on these issues. Many other events have taken place in recent weeks which I should like to mention, such as in Kosovo, the Middle East and Chechnya. There are also many other issues which I should like to discuss with you. However, I would prefer, Madam President, to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that I have time to answer them. However, before this happens, I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya. Mr Gil-Robles returned this morning from Chechnya where he visited Grozny. When we spoke he gave me his initial impressions which are not good, as you can imagine. The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating. In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations. In Grozny, there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat. Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you. Mr Gil-Robles told me that, when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night, the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities. The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well, if feasible. These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment. I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities. Madam President, this brings me to the end of my speech. I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning. I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission. This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations. Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world. Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana. I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Thank you, Mr Poettering. Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes. Commissioner, would you like to speak now or a little later? (The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later) Very well, thank you. Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Javier Solana, usted no es una persona loca, todo lo contrario (you are not mad, quite the opposite). We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit.	fi
Madam President, great importance has been attached to the reform process, which deserves to be acknowledged, although this may be somewhat premature. My question is this: there is a need for reform, due not least to the accession of new countries, and thus to the enlargement of the Union. How can we - the Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively, taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries? The delegations are actively engaged - as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic - but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another. How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission, and the work they perform together, more effective? I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that, apart from its own inherent merits, reform will be made necessary by accession, the enlargements, and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in. It is essential that we have that reform, both for the sake of the current Union, and certainly to facilitate accessions. In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started, together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously, of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States. We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering. I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities, the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market, it will be difficult to see the joins. That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see. All I can do now is to promise to strive for it. Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David' s Day. Thank you for the presentation. It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public. That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time. It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome, but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork. Excessive paperwork. Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control? That is a clear complaint that we get. That needs to be addressed. The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee. This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure. Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee' s work? Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words.	de
"The 1995 Convention, on the other hand, authorises the filing of secondary proceedings, thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the Commission would like to see accepted. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted, one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings. Nevertheless, I do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the 1995 Convention which was, moreover, based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years. Consequently, the Commission has refrained from presenting an amendment. Instead, it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues. The Commission feels, for this reason too, that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation, but I would nevertheless like to convey to you the Commission' s opinions on the amendments under discussion. The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner. On the other hand, it does not accept Amendment No 4. Indeed, the Commission feels that Parliament should instead support Amendment No 4 by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which would allow the annexes to the regulation to be modified by the Commission, assisted by a regulatory committee, in accordance with the on-going procedure of Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC. Therefore, with regard to the amendments proposed by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 3 and 4. On the other hand, it does not accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2, on the idea of ""centre of the debtor' s main interests"" . With regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person, this idea is clearly defined in Article 3. In all other cases that have not been specifically addressed, we feel that the reference made in Recital 13 should be sufficient. Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. (The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m.) Shipwreck of the Erika The next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Commission, on the shipwreck of the Erika. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today. Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments. He must have reconsidered and, in so doing, has, as usual, shown great respect for this House. I thank him for this. On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker Erika. There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue. Firstly, we must show the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident."	de
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament' s modus operandi. Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them. Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors. And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe. Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers, I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months. Mr President, Commissioner, the oral question tabled by Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠ shows that this House is taking a firm stance. Indeed, six months after the election of this new Parliament, we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe. I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this. We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice. Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems. This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres. For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged. A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism, xenophobia, nationalism and extreme-right racist movements. We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees. The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable. All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect. Last week, and somewhat by chance, I witnessed, at Roissy airport, a scene of rare violence in which two young women, admittedly illegal immigrants, were being returned to Conakry. They were treated like the worst criminals. They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair, surrounded by a horde of state security police. The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour. Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships. The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed. Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund, we could take the decision to set this up. The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though this summit provided an important basis. Likewise, we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action. The laws against racism must be harmonised. What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty? What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women? How do you aim to eradicate homophobia, racism and sexism?	fr
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency. As far as we are concerned, after producing the opinion expected from the Commission, according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated. We know, I know myself, that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us. I would just like to make a few comments, after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups. Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda. I understand this anxiety, this fear that the agenda may be too limited, and yet I feel, as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki, that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate. Indeed, it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate, which the Commission framed for its own opinion, but using all the terms thereof, plus everything between the lines. We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label. I do not like the term 'leftovers' any more than Richard Corbett does. It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects, and difficult, so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth. As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects, even though I do consider them as priorities, and consider that they must be dealt with now. They are the first but they are not the only subjects, Mr Seguro, that the conference must deal with. We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference, if the Portuguese Presidency firstly, and then the French Presidency, so wish, in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement. We are ready for it, whether it is a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which work has started, the CFSP and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations, or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work: reorganisation of the Treaties. I have heard many comments on the Commission' s opinion, which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth, with specific indications of new draft articles, but no one has said that we were going beyond the Helsinki mandate.	de
Mr President, Commissioners, when this House is called upon to debate human rights it is taking a chance, if you will, that is reinforced by the conditions that prevail when we are called upon to discuss such a crucial issue. The absence of the Council, as well as of the majority of MEPs, shows just how great the divide is between our noble, elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day-to-day policies when it comes to human rights. I believe that, as a beginning, Parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the Geneva session to narrow that divide. It should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support. We must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the headlines or abuses are being punished. The role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on, particularly at the level of prevention. In that sense, we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law. It seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed. Nowadays, there are many, perhaps too many, treaties on human rights. If those treaties remain mere expressions, they are no more than useless depositories of people's thoughts. The time has come to move on to a new and crucial phase, namely a phase in which the provisions of the treaties are applied on a daily and binding basis, although we ought not forget that some basic treaties are still to be transposed. I refer to the Rome Conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 Member States of the Union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court. In my view, we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally. We have often employed instruments which, at the formal level, make us feel comfortable, but which, in terms of practical results, are totally ineffectual. By that I mean the use, and often abuse, of embargoes during recent years, and the over-cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the European Union and third countries, where there have been human rights violations. In particular, we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded. Globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process. Many countries are currently questioning the principle of the universality of human rights. The belief is widespread that many human rights, including the right to life, contradicted as it is by the death penalty, depend on certain variables, while globalisation, which often has a negative connotation, is in danger of becoming the catch-all for rights, actions and policies everywhere in the world.	fr
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways. On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fishing industry, to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected, and also by asking them to demand, of international bodies and of themselves, tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience. In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag. On the other hand, prevention is essential. Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea. I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal - technological, structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future. Lastly, Mr President, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, who reminded me of old times when, as the then Mayoress, I lived through similar situations. We must thank those who, while defenceless and lacking in resources, have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks. Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, for her reaction to this incident, which has really shaken the whole of Europe. We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication. In addition, I should like to make a number of comments: First, the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA, the Italian shipping register, because we need to know if Community law was applied. That should be the starting point for our efforts. Secondly, apart from the shipowners' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage. Once we have done that, our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified. However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct. I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact. This legal framework is fairly advanced, at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied.	de
"""We are not 'globalphobes' they write at the end, ""but we want globalisation which benefits mankind and a fair world order without social exclusion"" . We here in the European Parliament do not oppose an agreement with Mexico. On the contrary! We are unable, however, to vote in favour of this agreement for the reasons stated and must continue to fight for better agreements in the future. One last word: we need a critical voice here in Parliament which continues to support the rightful concerns and demands of Mexican society. Mr President, we regard the title of the agreement which is the subject of Mrs Ferrer' s report as at best incomplete, at worst dissembling. It would in fact be more accurate to refer to a European Union-NAFTA agreement rather than an agreement associating the European Union with Mexico only. For this agreement, which the rapporteur herself describes as the most important one the European Union has ever signed with a third country, will not only affect our relations with Mexico but will also have implications for our relations with the North and Central American countries as a whole. The Ferrer report, following what is clearly now the fashion in this Parliament, sets itself the objective of helping to create a new framework that will enable European enterprises to compete on equal terms with the United States and Canada. That is a totally unrealistic objective for the near future and it is quite obvious for whose benefit the measures advocated in the text are designed. Indeed, it must be quite clear to everyone that the decline in European exports to Mexico is the result of the NAFTA agreement, which turns the entire area into a single free trade area. Does anyone seriously think, for example, that whatever the details of the system we set up, European textiles and cars, which are currently taxed at 35% and 23%, will soon be able to compete on equal terms with American exports of the same products, which are taxed at 1.8%? Under these conditions, how can anyone justify the fact that the respective markets will be liberalised at different rates, to the detriment of the Europeans? Finally, there is a real fear that this will have an immediate and tangible impact on employment in Europe in the sectors opened to Mexican products, especially in already vulnerable sectors - such as textiles, to name but one. These sectors do not need to face further competition, in return for opening up to markets blocked by the Americans. Moreover, the supposedly reassuring formulation of the rules on protecting designations of origin, and more generally on intellectual property, are more likely to have the opposite effect; their vagueness and wording seem more of a threat than a guarantee. Mr President, the conclusion of trade negotiations between the European Union and Mexico, considered from a positive perspective, could mean a new and durable framework for the institutionalisation of political dialogue and cooperation, provided that this trade pact works to the benefit of both sides. Unfortunately, the experience of NAFTA shows us that this target was not achieved automatically, because there is evidence that free trade has had an adverse effect on the lives of many people, exacerbated environmental damage, and marginalised wide sections of the Mexican population - all the more so as Mexican human rights NGOs have also reported a deterioration in the human rights situation since the interim agreement came into force in 1998. So, all in all, the on-going agreement has not allowed Mexico to protect vulnerable labour, intensive sectors and minimal environmental standards. In the light of this we cannot be optimistic, because the procedure followed in the recent negotiations, without effective control either in this House or in the Mexican Senate, provides ample evidence that the agreement lacks those mechanisms absolutely necessary to ensure that the damage currently being done will not be repeated again in the future. Mr President, Commissioner, we are about to vote on one more step down a new road, begun in mid-1995, when, like anything new, it met with quite a lot of criticism and quite a lot of reluctance."	fi
- (FR) Europe is facing real difficulties today. Like it or not, it is not the path of glory it aspired to be for the citizens of the Member States. It reflects what it is, namely a remote and restrictive machine whose sole purpose seems to be to enact finicky legislative rules obviously aimed at centralisation and standardisation. It is against that background that this year, as ever, we are once again debating human rights in the world and in the Union, accompanied this time by a debate on countering racism in the European Union and the candidate states. That could have allowed us to inject a little 'soul' into a system sadly in need of it. But that was not to be. The rapporteur, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the plenary have served us up documents that smell of death. These pseudo-defenders of the rights of man have quite simply forgotten that man is not a concept, a point in a political programme. The human being has a dignity, a mission that are far superior, if not contrary, to what is being put before us today. Respect for the human being means recognising that his legitimate rights correspond to legitimate obligations, that he must exercise his freedom responsibly, that his natural dignity presupposes moral points of reference. It is not a question of restricting that freedom but, on the contrary, of becoming aware that man lives within a family and national community, that his humanity imposes rules on him, failing which civilisation becomes synonymous with barbarism. I would not so much say that the European Parliament has missed an opportunity as that it has once again been true to itself, libertarian and, in the final analysis, liberticidal. - (FR) I could not vote for the report by Baroness Ludford and I want my abstention to be perceived as an expression of strong contempt, because of the incongruities and exaggerations contained in certain passages of this report. Various exaggerated statements and demands, especially those concerning third country nationals residing in the Member States of the European Union, are of a provocative nature and lead to reactions that the report terms racist. Yet the majority of the citizens of our Member States often cannot understand why it should be absolutely essential for third country nationals residing in the EU to enjoy the same rights as them, including the right to vote, when there are no reciprocal rights at all for EU nationals residing in those third countries. I know that in making these points I risk being demonised by the media and falling into the trap some sections of the report are setting for those among us who still dare express their opinion in the face of the exaggerations on which Baroness Ludford' s report bases what it sees as a rise in racism and xenophobia. - (FR) Today, the European Parliament is presenting us with the new man in a new world. The Ludford report is not an account of the good or bad situation as regards racism in the European Union; it is the political programme of an extreme left-wing libertarianism that, in the end, shows little concern for the natural rights of man.	el
It also, of course, damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital. The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference. It is, however, important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States. It is the Member States' parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty. It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification. Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text, which I shall vote for, even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it. Nevertheless, the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right. The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world. This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution. The amendment of the Treaties was, however, limited to a review of some internal rules, which was necessary and important, but did not answer the fundamental question: what is Europe, what are its common principles and therefore, its objectives and limitations? However, politics exacts its revenge, and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda, it comes back in, as a matter of fact, through a door, and through the front door in the case of Austria, since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intolerance, xenophobia and forms of racism. And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this. I belong to a world, the world of Liberal Catholics, which is not left-wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values, and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values. The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in a European Constitution, then we shall construct a Europe without a solid, lasting base. Commissioner Barnier, I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values: make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles, because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe.	el
"We know what actually happened. Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old. We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea. This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium. Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the ""polluter pays"" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate ""natural disasters"" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds. I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group. Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning. It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time. We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice. These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things. No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances. This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation. However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that. In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system. Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response. Many thanks for this. This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today. The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best. The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money. Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members. During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more."	fr
"The fact that the Russian tanks which withdrew in 1994 were often daubed with the words ""We' ll be back!"" did little to foster understanding between the Baltic states and Russia. And yet, despite this history, there has not been one single incident of violent clashes between the majority and minority sections of the population since they regained independence. We should therefore voice to the Estonians and Latvians our express recognition of the fact that they have managed to keep a cool head and that they are receptive to our arguments when it comes to adapting their legislation in this area to European standards. I therefore take the view that the express call to continue measures to integrate the Russian minority contained in point 14 of the Belder report is unnecessary. This is already happening. This express reference creates the erroneous impression that this is not the case. Madam President, it is a fact that over recent years, as immigration has increased, a climate of prejudice has started to creep in, racial violence has become more and more frequent and even political parties have been set up on the basis of racist ideology. In other words, a social climate is developing - and it made its appearance in a wing of our House this morning - which suggests that the protection of human dignity, respect for those who are different, democratic values and social solidarity have not yet been fully mastered. Our action to foster respect for human rights and create a fair society of creative coexistence therefore needs to be examined against a backdrop of policies and measures which seek to improve economic and social conditions for everyone and combat unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. The new multicultural Europe needs a policy which ensures that immigrants and different social groups and minorities are integrated into the social, political and economic life of national societies. What we need is a common European asylum and immigration policy based on European humanitarian values. Of course, the education sector is also important and we need huge improvements in education for the children of immigrants and gypsies. At the same time, the mass media need to help fight prejudices and to demonstrate the beauty of modern multicoloured, multicultural society. Of course, within this framework, respect for those who are conscientious objectors, for example, and who do not therefore wish to serve in the army, should be guaranteed. I should like to take this opportunity of assuring the European Parliament that the problem which used to exist in Greece no longer exists, following the adoption and application of legislation on 1.1.98. The reference in question, therefore, in Mr Haarder' s otherwise excellent report, is therefore irrelevant today. I must protest about the use by the United States of America of the death penalty on an almost industrial scale. This is the most powerful country in the world which claims to embody the cutting edge of civilisation. Regardless of the risk of judicial error, a society which uses this machinery of the law to knowingly and coldly perpetrate such a barbaric act, in order to wreak revenge for vile and barbaric acts committed by individuals, can only be regarded as behaving in a way which is worse than that which it condemns. The abolition of the death penalty worldwide is the very least that we should be calling for if we really want to defend human rights."	el
"When it comes to acceptance by the Council, I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible, even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals. I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis. Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments, one of the essential differences is that, in place of a ""service provision card plus notification for each individual contract"" system, provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract. This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms. However, in order to compensate for this, all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued, and as the Commission' s proposal would have it, more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued. An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection, not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter. This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident. Likewise, the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued, namely under the terms of an opposition procedure. What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States, rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States. I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs. I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months, and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting. However, we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months. When it comes to self-employed persons, in addition to the amendments already described, we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent, and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment. I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee' s amendments, which they adopted unanimously. I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions. I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament' s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted; whether or not one should use the number or date alone, or both, and how extensively to quote from them. Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report."	el
I also welcome, therefore, the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual, without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility. In practice, only 9 cases were rejected, 94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished, non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines, which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related, staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement To conclude, I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform: fair competition and equal competition conditions, legal certainty for all enterprises, consistent application of competition policy, procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop, coordination of the national - and to me, independent - competition authorities, close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission, along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law, and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies. I am in suspense as to how the discussions, which were broadly based, will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal. The Commission report confirms that, with the exception of Germany, state aid to businesses is increasing. The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition. As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes. Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business. Take, for example, the car manufacturing sector, where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period. With what aim? Not to save jobs. All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies. Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse. Did these firms need state aid to survive? No, car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years. State aid is not only counterproductive because, as the Jonckheer report acknowledges, it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another, but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders. It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed. In voting against the Jonckheer report, I wish to assert the need for another policy, to wit, ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff. Mr President, today' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market. In accordance with the principle of competition, the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94, competition policy in the strict sense, and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition.	fr
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative, opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area, even though it is true that more could have been expected, particularly with regard to access to the various strands. For a long time, probably a survival of our colonial heritage, our regions have fixed their attention on the European mainland, ignoring and even scorning their closest neighbours. That time is now past. Our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to, not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples, hence the intensely expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment. This increased awareness does not, however, affect identity alone. It is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets. So, for example, the island of R√©union is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia. It cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area, lest it miss out on a historic opportunity, and the same applies to our regions in the Caribbean. At last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment, the source of so much despair, if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the European structural funds. INTERREG appropriations may be used to make our regions into veritable European Union bridgeheads into these geographical areas, giving it worldwide scope. I am counting on the Commission, and specifically on you, Commissioner, to allocate adequate resources for effective action. Mr President, Commissioners, I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG, but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas. I understand the Commission' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation. Nonetheless, there are many maritime areas between which links are already established. Various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this. INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation. In consequence, I seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B. These adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects, particularly those of an infrastructural kind. Such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the EU. I hope for their adoption. Mr President, our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that, if you are a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group: you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems, rather than being defined as the problem. There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared. We also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level. We are concerned, therefore, as others have said, at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society' s most excluded, by aiming for a very narrow definition of ""refugee"". My group will not be supporting those amendments. We are also concerned at the number of amendments which, in seeking to introduce greater flexibility, run the risk perhaps of obscuring responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative. Mr President, I am very pleased to see URBAN orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems. Yet, there is some risk of dilution of effort. If we pursue too many objectives, our overall effectiveness suffers."	fi
A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged, which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments, which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies. We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas: Firstly, there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players, by which I mean donors, requiring greater coordination, greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems. At the same time, however, there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate, particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems, together with a need to focus special attention on these countries' own policies for reducing poverty. The second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development. This means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy, but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance, trade and investment. Furthermore, this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries' own policies. A third aspect of this new model that I would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives. Since 1995, following a concerted international effort between the main donor states, involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD' s Development Assistance Committee, it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies, both at national and international level. As you will know, the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50% by 2015, by increasing compulsory schooling, by significantly reducing child mortality rates, and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective. This would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world' s population lives, and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively. And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise. Particularly in recent years, development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter, and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership. The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here, as has the Bretton Woods system. I have in mind, in particular, the important impetus given to this debate by the World Bank, especially through its Comprehensive Framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund, where, for the first time, an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto unimaginable link, for a body of this type, between debt relief and poverty. This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context. The Portuguese Presidency has highlighted the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies, and to create greater scope for coordination, in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system. If we are to strengthen the European Union' s role in international development policies, we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action. Firstly, we need to make the EU' s development policy more effective. As you know, an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies, and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency. The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues. The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies, the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union' s present cooperation policies, the need to make the EU' s aid management more efficient and, in particular, to review its mechanisms for intervention, and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid.	fi
For this reason it may be necessary, as I have stressed, to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies. In this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention, which succeeds the Lom√© Convention, is an important instrument of renewal, and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process, as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle. . I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate. I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion. We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence. This discussion is not new. We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it, as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence. I have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda. This also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the Commission system which may very well include, as suggested by some of the political groups in Parliament, the setting up of a special intra-service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission. I have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything. I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist, and we certainly do have them. Much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every Member State, as has been very honestly said here in this House: people more or less identify with their spheres of interest, and all this is legitimate. I would, however, warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system. This exists, but it is only a small part of what we are discussing. The major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on, and this is the problem. Mr Mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low. This is true in our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective. They farm, not just for a living, but in order to live, and this makes a difference.	fr
This is why, Madam President, I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words, so that nobody, absolutely nobody, can use this message, which is unusual and unwise, to say the least, to contribute, and that includes counter to the intentions of Mr Prodi, towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in Austria a commonplace. Thank you, Mr Wurtz. I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, not to start a debate at this point. This was just a procedural motion. Let me remind you, Mr Wurtz, that we shall be seeing Mr Prodi tomorrow. He is going to make a statement on the Commission' s programme. Naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement, just as Mr Prodi will be perfectly free to answer you. I suggest that you clarify this matter at that time, if you so wish and if Mr Prodi agrees. Madam President, it is with great regret that I have to trouble you yet again with an issue that I have raised here twice before. I have already told you on a number of occasions that we, on behalf of the Dutch contingency, would like a Dutch television channel. There are now 28 channels here in this Parliament, including two Greek, one Portuguese, one Finnish and one Belgian, but still no Dutch, and as many as seven English, six German and six French. I was promised back in September that there would be a Dutch channel by January. It is now February and we are still waiting. I would ask you once again to work on this. I wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a Dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite. Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, let me say how disappointed I am, because I personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago. I have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti has an answer for you. I shall therefore, with your permission, give the floor to Mrs Banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion. Madam President, as my dear friend Elly will know, I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleagues happy. I would like to assure you as quaestor in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio, and I have already started mailing colleagues in this connection. If it is of any comfort to her, the Irish have not got their channel yet either. There seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this. I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel. I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can receive their own national channel. Thank you, Mrs Banotti, and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this. Madam President, I should like to tell Mr Wurtz that the Commission' s doctrine is not the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty and that, until proved otherwise, we are not in the situation where Articles 6 and 7 would be applicable. Austria, therefore, is perfectly entitled to form its government and the President of the Commission is perfectly entitled, and even duty bound, to offer Austria his best wishes. Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party, the French Communist mayors, were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France. Agenda The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure. a) Sittings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Relating to Wednesday: President. In view of the fact that no Council representative is able to attend on Wednesday evening, a number of groups - the Group of the European People' s Party, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left - requested that the Council statement on the Cyprus question and Mr Brok' s report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta were dealt with during the joint debate and that these two items plus Mr Swoboda' s report were brought forward in the agenda.	fi
I believe that it is important to point out one thing: expenditure effected under LEADER+ is eligible from the time that the Commission programme starts running. For all programmes submitted before 30 April of this year it will be possible to backdate the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 January. Finally, under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines. Having given them thorough consideration, I can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2, 4, 5 and 7 are acceptable to the Commission and are adopted. The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under LEADER+ is a maximum of 5 months. The amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has, in our view, been overtaken by events because, following consultations with the representatives of the Member States in the STAR Committee, this point has already been reworded along the lines proposed by Parliament. That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3. The Commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the Commission itself had originally proposed. I must add, however, that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the Member States. An amendment was therefore made in the committee, but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form. It will also continue to fight for Member States' acceptance of this. I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled. Here there are only three which the Commission cannot accept, Amendments Nos 3, 12 and 13. It can accept all of the others either in full or in essence. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time. Recently, because of political developments in Austria, there is growing unease within Europe. Political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue. It is worth stressing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies. We need specific proposals, both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies. So I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package as soon as possible. I now come to the EQUAL initiative, which is, of course, based on Article 13. The EQUAL initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of Article 13, namely the fight against discrimination based on race, gender, age, and special needs. I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs Stenzel, because her effort to reach agreement on the EQUAL initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex, both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue. The first comment, which has been made by many others too, is whether women should be mentioned separately. I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about, but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place. So on the basis of the Treaty as it stands today, the EQUAL initiative is structured in that way. I would like to remind you, however, that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared, the fifth programme for equality between men and women. I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups. Firstly, the enlargement of the thematic areas. As in employment strategy, there are four thematic areas: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament' s proposals. To answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination, I will say that the initiative states clearly that the Member States must submit one thematic category for each group that is suffering discrimination.	fi
Mr President, I have to say that I am most impressed by the principles which the Commissioner has set out. If we can limit these changes to the rules on qualified majority voting in connection with the operation of the single market to minimum provisions and to practice developed by the Court of Justice, I believe, in fact, that it may well be possible to implement these changes with the approval of all the countries, which is of course incredibly important. At the same time, I have to conclude that, if the Commission wants to adhere to these three good principles, then it must, at some point or another, disagree with the note which the Presidency has submitted. The Presidency has, of course, tabled the proposal that qualified majority voting should also apply to those areas dealt with in Article 137, paragraph 3, subparagraph 3, concerning the defence of employees' and employers' interests, and in Article 137, paragraph. 3, subparagraph 2, concerning the cancellation of contracts of employment. I have difficulty in seeing what the justification is for this on the basis of the three principles which have been laid down and which have been emphasised by the Commission. In the light of this, may I conclude that the Commissioner does not wish to comply with the Presidency' s note on these proposals? Commissioner, you are proceeding with the utmost caution, and that is an approach which I support. With reference to the argument of subsidiarity, I should simply like to tell you that, in my opinion, it is also important to put forward the argument of citizenship in fiscal matters. After fifty years of building Europe, it is unacceptable that the citizens of Europe should not be equal in the eyes of the law simply due to their being classed as resident or non-resident. The concept of citizenship is common property, on behalf of which we must move beyond failures such as Helsinki. I have three specific questions that I would like to ask you: My first question is this: do you anticipate that the instrument you are proposing might be applicable to the integration of financial markets and the requisite tax regulation thereof? My second question is: does the instrument that you are proposing in the area of environmental taxation provide for qualified majority voting? My third question is: would the instrument you are proposing enable the Council to put an end, by qualified majority decision, to the tax havens which exist within the European Union? Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement. I am sure that none of us here will object to fraud and tax evasion being tackled but I must say that it is necessary to maintain the confidence of citizens in the Union, and I think that many Member State governments will be wishing to look very carefully at any extension of QMV before agreeing to it. It does strike very much at the heart of what is perceived as the national ability to conduct one's affairs. I am thinking in particular of things such as the withholding tax, which it would have been quite unacceptable to have subjected to a QMV regime. I hope those points will be borne in mind when you look at the practicality of getting the package through. We are very happy to combat fraud and tax evasion and to improve social security legislation, but there are some points where there will be difficulty in convincing all the Member States to follow. Commissioner, I have some very simple questions for you, which require just a 'yes' or 'no' answer in each case. Can you guarantee that the Commission will not seek, under any circumstances, to use qualified majority voting to impose the withholding tax? Can you give the same guarantee in relation to the proposed tax on aircraft fuel, which was discussed in ECOFIN this week, and can you give the same guarantee in relation to corporation tax in the European Union? Are there any circumstances where the Commission would seek to use qualified majority voting on any of those issues? Can you guarantee that the Commission will not use qualified majority voting on any of those issues? Mr President, I can imagine that according to some Members, the citizens are sensitive to European intervention in tax and social matters. I can tell you that in my country, many citizens lie awake at night, worrying about the fact that Europe leaves social and tax matters well alone on account of this unanimity.	fi
However, people in the field complain about the limited role the EU is playing and the confused nature of EU funding for de-mining. Could the Commission provide me with a breakdown of the funding provided by the EU for all activities relating to anti-personnel mines? How much money goes into mine action programmes and how much into R&D in de-mining technology? Could the Commission draft an annual report on its APM policy to eliminate the existing lack of clarity? Could the Commission tell me what progress is being made with regard to introducing a regulation on anti-personnel mines, which would provide a legal base for these activities and bring them together within a single transparent framework? Question No 113 by (H-0251/00):  Subject: EU action to combat mines Will the wide range of action programmes to combat mines have to be financed solely from budget line B7-661, which is now more justified than ever? What provisions will be taken to ensure that NGOs enjoy effective access to Union funding? With reference to the conditions making aid conditional on accession to and compliance with the Treaty of Ottawa, what criteria and procedures will be used for the implementation of EU actions to ensure that, in the field, some vulnerable communities are not victimised twice? I hope you will excuse me that in answering the questions together, I take slightly longer. I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to reply to Mr van den Bos on anti-personnel mines today. I will also take this opportunity to respond to Madame Carlotti' s question. The Commissioners today adopted a communication and a draft regulation on European Union action against mines with the aim of achieving better coherence, greater effectiveness and more visibility in the very considerable activities in this area in which we are already involved. In doing this, we are responding to and building on the initiative of Parliament to create a specific budget line for mine action. Anti-personnel mines create appalling casualties in many of the poorest parts of the world. But they are not only a constant and treacherous threat to life and limb. They are obstacles to economic development and to the implementation of a range of Community programmes in support of reconstruction, rehabilitation and development. That is why the Union is already involved extensively in mine action across the globe and why we were so active in the negotiation and conclusion of the Ottawa Convention on the prohibition and destruction of anti-personnel mines which entered into force a year ago. Over the past eight years, European Community support for mine action has exceeded EUR 180 million. We have intervened in all corners of the world. We have supported action by national authorities, international organisations, and not least NGOs. We have contributed to de-mining and mine destruction as well as to victim assistance and research into new de-mining technology. But until now, we have not had a coherent overall approach to our mine action. To take full advantage of the diversity of our instruments and funding mechanisms, we must make sure that we have a framework in which we can formulate the necessary horizontal guidelines and priorities in order to ensure effectiveness and consistency in what we do.	el
The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making. In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women. However, this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men. Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent. The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women. There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women, who are ready and able, to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process. There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system. Some Members have even come out against this. Personally, I would not want to feel like a quota, to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman. This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference. Mr President, I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for good speeches on their part which I think provide hope for real optimism, especially given the will and commitment radiated by both women. I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women. It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear, what we are concerned with here. I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission - but then, of course, she is young and full of energy. I am convinced that it will be hard work, when all is said and done. If the Commissioner asks for support from Parliament, she can in any case count upon the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality. I would say to the Portuguese minister that I completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power. That is absolutely crucial. It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women. Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children. Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today. Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves. What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides' surrendering power. The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden. Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark. And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark. In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland. We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing. I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources. It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term.	fi
We note your concern and will pass this on through the appropriate channels. Violence between ethnic groups in Mitrovica and Albanian prisoners in Serbia, notably the plight of Mrs Flora Brovina  Mr President, Commissioner, we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons. First, because Mr Sakellariou, who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote, vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender. I have no doubt, and I am sure that you have no doubt, that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance. The other reason is that this text does not, unfortunately, go very far. I think that it manages, through a series of clever devices, to carefully avoid addressing the central issue, i.e. the final status of Kosovo. I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia. I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of Kosovo. I also doubt that any of you think that, as things stand, it is not in Milosevic' s interest to pull out all the stops and destabilise Kosovo, as he is doing and as we have seen. Finally, I do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to Kosovo. I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution, which you no doubt overlooked. You condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troops. I would not want you to be birds of ill omen, but I fear that, by failing to confront the real issue, you will end up being just that and I shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen. On the contrary, I think it is our duty to call on the Commission and the Council, which unfortunately is not present, to insist that the United Nations consider the question of the final status of Kosovo, of the multiplicity of micro-states in the region, of what happens post-Dayton and, finally, the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be built up in these countries and give the European Union a policy in this region. Finally, I would stress that we have been asking the Council and the Commission since July to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 Kosovar prisoners and Mrs Brovina, Mr Jurti and Mr Hoti. I note that the Union is preparing to lift certain sanctions and that we have not seen even one of these prisoners released in exchange. Why not? Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible. Violence begets violence, and revenge begets revenge. The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on. The Chief Commissioner of Police, Svend Frederiksen, has expressed his desperation at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed.	de
We do not have much idea of how the responsibilities can be divided between governments and Commission, or what role trade unions and civil society can play. So we want supplementary analyses taken into account, we want firmer commitments, we want a specific point about strengthening employment and social cohesion in the information society - because there is nothing about that in the Commission' s communication - and we want a strategy with guidelines, recommendations and indicators. We want adults mentioned, not just young people, we want disadvantaged groups mentioned and we want you to remember equality of opportunity too. The new society must not exacerbate inequality between men and women. Commissioner, there are great opportunities here, but they must reach all the people. And we want the European social model to be defended. So we are asking for a step forward, with more specific commitments and far more adequate political and financial efforts. Mr President, Commissioner Liikanen, the e-Europe initiative by the European Commission is to be welcomed in principle. We all agree that new technologies will lead to extensive change, not only in our business life but in all aspects of our social life. It is also true that the evolution from industrial society to information society cannot be halted and that it therefore makes political sense to prepare Europe for the information society as best we can. I therefore expressly welcome the statement in the e-Europe initiative that its prime objective is to accelerate the positive transformation to the information society in the European Union and gear the transformation towards social and regional integration. The European Commission sets out ten measures in its communication on the e-Europe initiative, which should level the playing field in the run up to the information society in Europe. As welcome as the individual measures are, they need to be structured as a whole and clear priorities need to be set for our policy. This includes clearly differentiating which tasks the European Union can and must take care of itself and which tasks come within the jurisdiction of the individual Member States, taking account of the fact that some Member States and regions have been promoting the new technologies and fostering their acceptance by their citizens for years now. In this respect, the summit in Lisbon should table recommendations to the individual states, without imposing comprehensive obligations or heavy financial burdens. What must the European Union do within the framework of the e-Europe initiative? In my opinion, the following priorities should be taken care of by the Union and should have been addressed as core points in Mrs Read' s report, for which I should like, at this point, to thank her. First: we must create an open, modern, high-performance multimedia infrastructure. The policy objective must be to ensure that Europe has a modern, high-performance infrastructure which allows valuable quality telecommunications services to be supplied and demanded from the telephone via the PC and television. This includes cheaper Internet access for all the citizens of Europe, which means fostering even more competition in local networks, for example by unbundling customer access.	el
The first principle means creating a new 'pact' between farmers and society, making the farmer 'steward of the countryside' and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside' s recreation value. The second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector, so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented. In this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the CAP. The LEADER Community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs. The following objectives were set: improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas. LEADER I applied to the rural areas covered by Structural Fund Objectives 1 and 5b, and 217 local action groups participated in it, with financing of EUR 1 155 million. LEADER II (1994-1999), for which a total evaluation has, unfortunately, not yet been completed, had a wider scope than LEADER I: there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated, after reallocation of resources, probably amounted to over EUR 4 000 million. In October 1999, following the success of LEADER I and LEADER II, the Commission decided to extend the initiative. For the 2000-2006 period provision has been made, unfortunately, only for a total contribution of EUR 2 020 million, and an indicative allocation for each Member State has been set. LEADER+ differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible. It is also more ambitious, and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet. The main changes are as follows: all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from LEADER+; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes, such as the use of information technology, improving the quality of life, and adding value to local products. I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because, as I was saying, it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious, even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population densities. I believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the Union and I repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence, such as the Carrefours. I share the Commission' s preference for the use of global grants while urging, however, that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and painstakingly defined. I regret the delay with which LEADER, as was the case with the other three initiatives, was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure. Finally, I am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated, if you consider, in addition, that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the Union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous LEADER II. I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation, and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative, whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market. The report was a major undertaking because it also incorporates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.	fi
That cannot continue. When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem, those responsible are liable. Mr President, it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority. My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed. You are unclear about this in your White Paper. What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list? When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof? The final part of my question is as follows: when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States? That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper. Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement. I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality. The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one. Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs. However, as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years, I have to ask: if Europe has the safest food control system, as you have said, why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives? Secondly, will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States? We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this. Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws, given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003? President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper. I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised. Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability. That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability. Once that is done, issues such as liability can be addressed. I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved. But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration. Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list. That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation, and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material. At the moment the list is, as I say, a negative list and it is added to as required. The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it, 2002 in fact. The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation. Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed. This is unfortunate and it is wrong, and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done.	de
Furthermore, as regards consultations with Parliament, Commissioner Bolkestein will meet the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism next Monday. The studies were sent to the committee and to the MEPs who requested them, in September 1999 and are, in any case, still available. They can also be consulted on the Commission's Internet website. I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein will listen carefully to all Parliament's comments. The Commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector. Furthermore, the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation. I can confirm that it is Commissioner Bolkestein' s firm intention to present a proposal to the Commission by the middle of the year, to be forwarded to Parliament and the Council. The date set for completing the next phase, which the Commission intends to keep to, is 1 January 2003. The proposal will take account of the studies and, in particular, the need to maintain a universal service, to develop efficient safeguards for consumers, to create a climate favourable to new jobs and to solve any problems relating to competition. The role of liberalisation in modernising and improving postal services throughout the Union with the help of new technologies will be examined in order to identify potential benefits for the industry as a whole. The proposal, when it is put forward, will take account of the points of view of Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties, all of whom have been involved in an in-depth consultation process. The aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the European Union. Mr President, the postal sector continues to be an area in which old, outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition. And, in the absence of any energetic action by the Commission, the situation has gone on for far too long. The EU' s competition authority has intervened in all other areas, but not in the postal sector. We have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the Commission to put forward proposals, so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new, modern Europe-wide postal system. One of the EU' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market. We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States. That requires greater efficiency which, in turn, is dependent on competition. Today, one area after another is being compelled to introduce deregulation and liberalisation, an exercise in which the EU often leads the way, while the Commission's determination to make progress serves as a model. The Commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects. It is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and, moreover, because it will lead to lower prices. All that, we are assured, will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market. It has been done in a number of different areas but, unfortunately, the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now. It can hardly be because customers are satisfied. We are all familiar with the much-criticised price hikes, and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion. If we really want a functioning internal market, we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services. A number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services. The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have travelled furthest along this road. During the 1990s, they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved. Moreover, Sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus. The process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement. Experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which, as customers, we are all entitled to expect. Prior to this discussion, a letter was sent out by supporters of the old monopolies.	fi
Europe is full of Haiders. We are Haiders when, to give the minor example of an incident which took place in Rome last week, Bosnian Roma refugees are deported with the approval of the mayor and sent back without aid to places of conflict; children and mothers, brothers and sisters separated, without even the time to gather together any belongings to take with them; children born in Italy snatched away from their schools where they have become integrated and made good friends with the other pupils. We are Haiders when, in Rome, parties of the right-wing opposition and the new centre incite the people to hatred and prevent the authorities from accommodating the Roma safely in places with running water and electricity. And this does not mean that I do not condemn the unlawful behaviour of many Roma and other immigrants. I would like to be able to share with everyone my conviction that, in our countries, no one is a stranger. For this reason I give my full support to the proposals contained in the resolutions which promote and lend support to all those elements which contribute to a culture of peaceful coexistence and all-embracing citizenship. Mr President, I should like to concentrate mainly on certain aspects of the Belder report, which contains an excellent analysis of the current situation in the candidate countries. As far as these candidates are concerned, and this has already been said, we must avoid creating the impression that we demand higher standards of them than we meet ourselves. We should compare the actual situation in these countries with the reality in our own countries rather than with our perfect legal texts, otherwise the candidate countries will always come off worse in practice. Certainly nobody contests the fact that candidate countries which, for example, only acquired their independence recently, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, have the right to redefine and articulate their own national identity first. As the Communist dictatorship under which they previously suffered obviously did not foster a culture of pluralist debate, many forms of expression of national identity appear to us to be overstretched or even to be directed, indirectly, against minorities within the country or in one or more neighbouring countries. We should not look down from our high moral horse and condemn this phenomenon as long as it is only a question of temporary manifestations on the path towards self-definition. However, we should give these countries en route to the EU the specific support that they require so that the self-awareness which they need to find is not based first and foremost on negative restrictions on minorities or neighbours. I should like to use the situation in Estonia and Latvia as an example of a positive development between two sections of the population which is by no means self-evident. It is not self-evident given their history of illegal occupation and deportation and the politically motivated transfer of people into their countries, accompanied by the suppression of every expression of national self-determination up to the end of the 1980s.	el
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures. Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States. Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement. What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this. For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States. After five years only four have done so. This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office. There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity. We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised. The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process. We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals. In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established. I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment. The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings. The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF. The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency. The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and to OLAF' s relationship with the national authorities. There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States. The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts. In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called corpus juris, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared. Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men. The Commission, Mr Barnier, Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea. I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority. We can set another example here, to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular, fraud, and to mete out punishment where necessary. Mr President, I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato. I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well, and the result, which we have received today, is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area. This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4). If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand, least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought. The Treaty is a collection of complex articles. However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.	fi
After all, it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting. As has also been pointed out, in summer 1998 the Commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken, such as information, further training - an important area, cooperation between the euro-states and of course even beyond them, and measures under criminal law. That is what this framework decision is about. Mrs Cederschi√∂ld, let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the Commission and, above all, let me also thank Parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time. I certainly appreciate that. The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences. Of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and, as was emphasised, what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced. Naturally, the Commission is also glad that the European Parliament' s prompt decision - and I hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now, so that we can begin to transpose it. For the Commission has been asked to report, as it will in the first half of next year, on the progress in transposing it in the Member States, on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action. It has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law. In that respect we must recognise this innovation, this step, even if, as Mr Schulz just pointed out, simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step. In reply to the question whether the Commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the Treaty, the Commission believes that the right basis is being applied here. The framework decision will, however, have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future. The Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with Europol. That proposal will establish a duty to cooperate, and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify Europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, so that effective measures can then be taken. On the question of coordinating the various measures, since early 1998, the Commission, followed now by OLAF, has been working with experts on the subject from the Member States, the European Central Bank and Europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance. As Mr Karas just pointed out, a few weeks ago the Commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro, to which it proposed allocating as much as EUR 32 million. That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	fr
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined. The truth is that the single market is not yet complete. During my six months as a Member of this Parliament, I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project. We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe. But all this, in effect, is so much rhetoric when we look at the national, regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market. That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission's proposals. I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti. We look to him as the man to root out cartels. But he would recognise that, as for everybody else, we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination. That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr von Wogau. I want to congratulate him, sadly in his absence, for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side! He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support. So although I may not share his conclusions, I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address. The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy. I know that the Commission is set against this, but the potential exists. I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities. I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process. I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation. Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court. Well, we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment. We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment, in which we have the support of the Commission. Unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point, in the Factortame case, in which the British Government was the defendant, it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling. So, judicially, something needs to be done. I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area. In relation to legal certainty, I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen. It is important that business has legal certainty. I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently. He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers.	fr
"Finally, it needs to be borne in mind that - whatever happens - the real solution to the problems of comitology for the European Parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the Treaties, and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an anomaly that severely restricts the Commission' s executive power and may prejudice the European Parliament' s legislative powers. Mr President, comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means. It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies, which is the way things used to be. In fact, it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission. The procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures. Up until the Amsterdam Treaty, there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures, which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens. On the contrary, for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed. For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees. Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors. A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases. It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny. With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced - as the European Parliament had long wanted - to three procedures, the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure. Now, following the Amsterdam Treaty, the rights of information and control granted to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement. Mrs Frassoni, our rapporteur, has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within Parliament. A key problem is the time factor. When the European Parliament is informed, it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks, should it so wish. In matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be in a position to react very rapidly, if necessary within a few hours or days. Nevertheless, the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react. Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties, which I and my group can only support in full. I just have one more request. In the German version, paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather misleadingly and I urgently ask for clarification, which I would also like to see in the printed version later. In my view, instead of ""weitergef√ºhrt werden m√ºssen"" the wording should be ""erhalten bleiben m√ºssen"" ."	de
This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state. But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters. Moreover, this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms. According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor is needed, in particular, in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office, OLAF. At the same time, however, we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court. In this way, a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one, and a medium-sized one may hide a large one. Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one, as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then, why not a European Minister of Justice, supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament? I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform, which appears to be quite specific. In the final analysis, we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form, organised around a superstate. The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on the other hand, wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network. And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities, for example, and the creation, if necessary, of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances. So the legal framework, Mr President, is already in place. It is fine, in principle. It need only be fine-tuned. Mr President, Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason. Public opinion, although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows, is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution: a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General. Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI, the European police, in the form of OLAF. All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible. And indeed there is a twofold shift. Firstly, the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift, a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomatic service, a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor. All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion, while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Generalised System of Preferences, free trade areas, customs presents to Chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource, GDP, as a result of the budgetary rationing pact.	de
Did anyone find work? How many people found work? If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before. What has been done about training? Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees? Do we have any figures? In other words, do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece? Mr Papayannakis, the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies. Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and, as far as I can see, an increase in productivity. The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines. As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated. They concern access to training, the ratio of men to women with access to training, and special action for the long-term unemployed. The Commission will endeavour, for all these specific guidelines, to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006. Question No 36 by (H-0782/99): Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy? The Danish pension scheme, the Efterl√∏n, only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire. Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire. The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law. It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are, however, still pending before the Council. There is, as yet, no European Court case law on Efterl√∏n, but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality. The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach. The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark. I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission, but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been. I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission. The Commissioner also more than hinted, of course, that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions, due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system. I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter, for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate. So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question. Honourable Member, I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law. This is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter, to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who, as things stand, have a right to this pension. Briefly, just to follow on from that last point, I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission's objections, such as they are, would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme, but simply that the Commission has a concern, which it has the right to have under Community law, to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify.	fi
We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit. Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians. I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life. These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated. I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo. There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again. It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo. It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo. What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together. We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough. We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights. All of this needs to happen, and quickly too. If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise. That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available. Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary. . (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue. This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned. I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight' s debate. Firstly, although much progress has been made, and we could mention customs administration, bank administration or tax administration, it is true that we must continue to move forward. However, in moving forward, what should we be financing? This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement. In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds, for example, Amendments Nos 3 and 5. In our view, however, in both respects, greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which, on the ground, is more aware of the reality than we are. We believe that to prejudge, at the moment, where resources should be directed, would create more practical difficulties.	de
"Let us not forget that, in 1999, 717,000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate. In social terms, it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain. We must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes, mergers, take-overs, new technologies etc. What is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs, for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity, because sometimes, as the title of the film states, the postman always rings twice. In my humble opinion, it is the responsibility of all European, national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion. It seems to me, Commissioner, that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities. Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work, which is the reason why there is broader agreement, and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution. I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said. First, I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled: ""The future of social protection"" and there have been statements from the European Parliament, those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk. Today, we have the statement by Mr Andersson. I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection. The second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate. You know very well that the Treaty provides no legal basis for policies at European level, but there is the agreement expressed at the last Council, there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience, as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the Member States. The third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses, which relate to paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social convergence and lastly quality in health care, there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies. The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken. As you know, a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency, which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June. The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things: sustainable pension systems and social accession. I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group. Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems, the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States, I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion."	de
"With all due respect to the Gothenburg protocol - and despite the fact that it has taken its name from my home town - I have to say that it is, in fact, just not on to compare this with the directive which we have to take a decision on tomorrow. One might well wonder why the Commission' s directive appears only a month later, rather like a punishment directed against this UN directive, but that has to do, of course, with nothing other than our own sluggishness in dealing with the issue. If we had been a little quicker off the mark, the present directive would have been on the table - signed, sealed and delivered - long before the so-called Gothenburg Protocol. The word ""impossible"" has been used about the directive. I should like to say, however, that what is impossible is the situation which we have at present. The impossibility lies, therefore, not in the directive but in the current situation. Mr President, my congratulations to Mrs Myller who I know has thought long and hard about this report. It seems to me that the debate comes down to this: do we believe that the Gothenburg Protocol was the best Member States can realistically achieve? I recognise that the Commission and environmental groups believe that in practice much more can be delivered but nonetheless some Member States have committed themselves to significant reductions in air pollution - though that is certainly not true of all of them. Some Member States seem to have gone into the negotiations with a few calculations on the back of an envelope and refused to compromise in any way to set themselves any realistic targets. Others have not even used the same methodology, the same basis of calculation as others. So the protocol in many ways is a nonsense. It can give us no confidence whatsoever. It is a messy political compromise and nothing more. I do not know how much more the Commissioner can achieve but we should be seeking reductions in air pollution and we should be giving her our support in her efforts to negotiate them. We should support this report and give her our backing. Mr President, Mrs Myller has produced an excellent report, and our group too thinks we should go at lot further than the Gothenburg Protocol on this. In all probability, drafting this directive was like a national auction, and the end result is very modest when we think what the real challenges are. But, in any case, it is important that the European Parliament should now defend at least that policy which the Commission has chosen. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposes that even stricter goals should be set for 2010 than the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has recommended. We want to emphasise that an integrated strategy must be adopted to reduce emissions. We have to remember that, in any case, we have the implementation of the Kyoto commitments ahead of us, which will mean insisting on more efficient use of energy and simply using less of it. So, in our opinion, this directive must take into consideration that added benefit is to be had from an integrated strategy as regards implementing its objectives."	el
In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility. Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party. My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand. I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions. This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about. May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament. A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly. If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality, six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants, you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales, which is a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom. Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in this House at the moment; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen. Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700, bring in 26% more population over time, and then adopt the Commission' s, I think ill-considered, proposition, that there should be a European list of candidates. What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here? It will become totally invisible! Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones. A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view. Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times. This time, however, it is true. We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement. The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not. Will we enlarge with or without deep reform? That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method. It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place. That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand. The Council must realise that, if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further.	fr
These are serious matters on which this House must act. We are about to advance into new territory where attitudes and symbols are of great significance. A political community is reflected in the justice which it hands out. This is why this report is so important. It represents a step towards the area of freedom, security and, particularly, justice to which we all aspire. It is also an important step towards European natural justice. This will be built on mutual confidence between the Member States and their respective legal systems and on the confidence of the European people in any European court. It will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular. It is in this respect that this House has significantly - and in my opinion rightly - altered the balance proposed by the Council by firmly and decidedly supporting a reinforcement of these guarantees of fair trials in all the amendments. Mr President, as the rapporteur said, this House has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the Convention. On behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have tabled an amendment to the motion for a resolution which asks the Council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible. The regulation of phone tapping in the Council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate. Yet a lack of regulation is also inappropriate and may lead to abuses in the telecommunications field. In fact, we are aware that these are already happening widely. The other point which I must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video conferencing with regard to accused persons. Again on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have asked the Council to produce a convention as soon as possible in order to clarify and supplement the regulation of this issue, which is frankly unsatisfactory. Apart from a few exceptions, the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party will vote in favour of the committee' s amendments, and of course our own. Mr President, it is our opinion that one facet of the construction of Europe hinges on the construction of a common judicial system, for the Europe that we want to build, which comprises administrative law, civil law, both substantive and procedural, and criminal law, both substantive and procedural. The Convention on Mutual Assistance and Criminal Matters, which we are examining today, is but a stitch in the great fabric of the corpus iuris of Europe, which has its natural foundation in fundamental human rights and freedoms. Thus it is that legal cooperation and cooperation on criminal matters must also strictly respect fundamental rights, principles which lie at very root of our culture and our civilisation: I am thinking of fair trials, and more particularly of the rights of the defence, of the impartiality and integrity of judges, of the length of legal proceedings, for which my country, Italy, unfortunately has the worst record in terms of the number of sentences handed down, of the cases pending before the European Court of Human Rights. Restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law. The report that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has substantially amended with regard to its original formula, taking up many of the amendments we have presented, still leaves room for a certain confusion, in relation to the way in which the interception of telecommunications and video conferences are to be regulated. The news received in recent weeks on the way in which modern technologies facilitate interceptions mean that greater attention must be paid to this issue: we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and troubled than the dark scenes depicted by Orwell. This is only the beginning of a great project in the field of law, which should advance hand in hand with the growth the type of Europe we want to see. Mr President, committee amendments and political group amendments may be tabled in plenary, but not amendments from individual Members.	fi
The text of the proposal for a Regulation has been amended quite extensively in the Committee on Fisheries. All the members of our Group voted in favour of these amendments, both in committee and in Parliament. Amendment No 1 serves to clarify the text considerably. Specifically, the data collected must not be intended for purely scientific use. Scientists must process this data and pass it on to the relevant political decision-making authorities. It is, however, crucial for the data collection method to be carried out in a scientifically justified manner. Amendment No 2 amends the initial Commission proposal. What the Commission proposal suggests is drawing up extremely detailed studies of individual vessels and individual businesses. In addition to the extremely high cost of such a proposal, the cumbersome nature of its management may cause some administrations to use its complexities as a pretext not to provide the information in due time and may give rise to a certain feeling of suspicion among the people working in the sector if they have onerous additional bureaucratic constraints foisted upon them in this way. Regarding the second part of this amendment, it is important that job losses in the industry are counted and identified much more clearly. Let us not forget that in the administration of a common fisheries policy the statistical analysis used must include the social aspect. Amendment No 3 makes it possible to add an important aspect: the collection of environmental data. The value of this can be gauged from the particularly serious effects caused by failing to take data of this type into account, for example, in the case of the decision on the prohibition of drift gillnets, which is totally unjustifiable from the environmental standpoint, since they are one of the most selective types of fishing gear that exist. If this environmental dimension were not incorporated into the management of data, then the Commission would be able unilaterally, just as it pleases, to prohibit the use of any particular type of fishing gear. Amendment No 4 specifies the obligation upon scientists to process all the data and pass it on to the relevant authorities, including national and regional authorities, in order to contribute to the decision-making process. Amendment No 5 serves to mitigate the Commission proposal. Effectively, the information requested from the authorities must be reasonable in order to allow an operational overview of fishing activities without compromising essential rights to confidentiality, for example, in fiscal matters, where the Community has no jurisdiction. Amendment No 6 is intended to tighten up the Commission' s participation in the inspection procedure. It is essential that all the data is sent on an annual basis and that the Commission should produce regular reports of the aggregated results. Finally, Amendment No 7 requires the Commission to produce a report by the end of the year 2001. In fact, because the reform of the common fisheries policy is scheduled for 2002, it is essential that all the political participants should be given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the information which will form the basis of the Commission proposal. Hudghton report (A5-0036/2000) - (FR) The amendment to the directive as presented by the Commission is an important one since it deals with a specific disease, i.e. infectious salmon anaemia, a contagious viral disease. It is a water-borne virus and is transmitted via organic substances such as blood, faecal matter, mucus, etc. There is no scientific proof of the possibility of vertical transmission of the disease through roe. It is, however, recognised that other species such as trout, eels or herring, may be carriers of the virus without being affected by it.	de
"We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date. We have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater. We believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near pristine standard. The foregoing is the reason for our vote. . (FR) Water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed. The framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area. It has clear, ambitious objectives. We share them. It sets environmental parameters close to zero. But we feel that it would be wiser not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet. We need a timetable, by all means, but a more gradual timetable. The legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation, i.e. to stop discharges within 20 years, would in fact mean a ban on all identified substances. Such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross-border areas and in candidate countries, thereby complicating enlargement. I should like, naturally, to refer to a specific sector to which I am very closely attached, i.e. agriculture, the main water-consuming sector. Agriculture must accept its share of 'polluter pays' charges, and has in fact already started to do so, but account must also be taken of its special characteristics and constraints, especially in arid regions. As regards the amendments concerning radioactive substances, I am of course in favour of controls, but the question arises of the legal basis, which comes under the Euratom Treaty. Andersson report (A5-0033/2000) The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the Andersson report. This does, of course, contain a number of good observations. For example, it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that ""the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the Member States make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the Member States' social security systems"" . Now, the concept of ""uniform harmonisation"" is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question. It is also true, as it states in the explanatory statement, that harmonisation could be damaging as ""it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security. No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation"" . The situation, however, is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation, and uniform harmonisation into the bargain. Paragraph D points out that ""the Union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria"" , and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the Ecofin Council and the Social Affairs and Employment Councils. Finally, paragraph 7 emphasises that ""the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination"" . And, in this regard, we approach the heart of the matter. This project, with its social harmonisation, does not constitute social policy."	de
(The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. for a formal sitting on the occasion of an address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic and resumed at 12.50 p.m.) VOTE (continuation) We shall now continue with the vote on the Stenzel report on the EQUAL initiative (A5-0034/2000). (Parliament adopted the resolution) Recommendation for second reading: (A5-0027/2000) by Ms Lienemann, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067(COD)) Before the vote: . (FR) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE. I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries, whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean, countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have, for the most part, been retained in the common position adopted by the Council. As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%). In my opinion, the most important amendments concern the following: LIFE' s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment, particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies, as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment; Improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE, procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public, and procedures for cooperation between recipients; The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere; The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation. I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe. The other candidate countries (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries. The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004). The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million. I support Mrs Lienemann' s firm stance. The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created, even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement. If the report is adopted in plenary session, then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme. This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions!	de
So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success. It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures. Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States. Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement. What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this. For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States. After five years only four have done so. This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office. There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity. We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised. The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process. We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals. In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established. I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment. The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings. The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF. The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency. The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and to OLAF' s relationship with the national authorities. There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States. The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts. In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called corpus juris, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared.	fr
B5-0272/2000 by Mrs Schr√∂der and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance; B5-0278/2000 by Mr Salafranca S√°nchez Neyra and others on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the Western Sahara. Mr President, this Parliament has long been calling for compliance with the United Nations resolutions and for the European Union, that is the Commission and the Council, to become more deeply involved in solving the Sahrawi problem. Although we are going to vote in favour of this resolution - which I regard as a good consensus resolution, calling for the obvious once again - I would perhaps have worded certain points differently. I refer to the statement that both parties, Morocco and Western Sahara, must make equal efforts to resolve the conflict. We believe there should be more emphasis on asking Morocco to concentrate its political will on resolving the conflict, because the Sahrawis have demonstrated time and again that they want it finally resolved. They have released prisoners and accepted the United Nations rulings on eligible voters. It is the Moroccan Government that has been putting obstacles in the way of resolving the conflict. The latest obstacle to delay this referendum indefinitely has been the introduction of 76 000 appeals to the United Nations from possible voters in the referendum on Western Sahara. If obstacles continue to be put in the way, we may be responsible for a more serious conflict. Some people are shocked that the Sahrawi people are now saying they are left with no alternative but to take up arms again. I am not shocked. I can understand it. It is a solution nobody wants, of course, but it is one we are forcing them into. Mr President, the European Union - and Parliament within it, of course - must strive to avoid a new conflict in an area which is already troubled enough. We do not want Western Sahara to become another East Timor, Mr President, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are circumstances which make Western Sahara a highly topical issue and they are relevant this evening. The first is the United Nations Security Council' s urgent resolution of 29 February, which agreed to extend the MINURSO mandate to the end of May. Secondly, there is the food crisis facing the Sahrawi refugees in the desert camps. Mention must be made of serious incidents which have recently occurred in the occupied territories of Western Sahara, where pro-referendum demonstrations have been suppressed by the Moroccan authorities. Mention must also be made of the visit the Maghreb Delegation will be making to Morocco next week and the King of Morocco' s favourable attitude to the European Parliament visiting the territory of Western Sahara for the first time. The instability that could become endemic in this part of Africa could affect some of the outermost Community regions, like my region, the Canary Islands. Our citizens want a peaceful solution to the conflict in Western Sahara and they want the Sahrawi people to hold the referendum under conditions of freedom, transparency and equality. And finally, one of the objectives of the European Union' s common foreign and security policy is the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of international security. And here the High Representative for the CFSP, Mr Solana, ought to play a more active role in achieving adequate guarantees for the Sahrawi people through an active presence and direct participation in the stages of the peace process and the referendum. That is why we support the motion for a resolution. Mr President, first we must express our concern for the Sahrawi people, many of whom have experienced long years of exile and suffering. Solving their problem means respecting the deadlines for holding the referendum that has been postponed again and again. If there were to be another postponement it would seriously aggravate the problem.	fi
Firstly, fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, there have been direct provisions, the code of good conduct in particular. This has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca 'time goes by' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances. In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions. Firstly, it is necessary, in drawing up the legislation, to produce clear and complete rules. It is probably horrendous, especially in this particular raft of legislation, that there are confused rules, regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts. This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities. Thirdly, it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission, in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies. Fourthly, and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed. We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world. The principle of competition must now be universal in its application. We must monitor compliance with environmental standards, employment standards, in order to prevent dumping in this area, and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid, which in many industries - as has already been said - distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory. To sum up, we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid, internal distortions by other countries, from being transferred to the international arena, in other words, through trickery. Mr President, Commissioner Monti, there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors. First of all the report reveals Parliament' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly. Many of the report' s conclusions, however, are cause for concern, at least for our group. For example, the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this. Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages, thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective, uneconomic division of Europe' s meagre resources. The form the aid takes is important. Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported. For example, state guarantees, on which the Commission has just publicised its position, must naturally be considered state aid, but they are, in my opinion, a better option than granting aid directly to companies. The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency, which affects competitiveness.	fr
"I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated. I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union. I urge the Commission to be less cautious. In this resolution, Parliament is assuming its responsibilities. Having said that, in my opinion, the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum, the very least we could do. Personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line, and I supported Amendments Nos 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group. In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party. Including J√∂rg Haider' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe, and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries. The Austrian People' s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this. It is our fundamental values which are at stake here. As the democratically elected representatives of the European people, we have no choice. We must reject what is unacceptable, as our constituents demand. Because, when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces, failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation. I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution. I condemn J√∂rg Haider' s racist and xenophobic policy. However, I cannot accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State. I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution, and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution, even though it would be a vote against the extreme right. - (SV) Obviously, the political leaders of Europe have a right and a duty to react against Mr Haider and his party. The political leaders of Europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another Member State, just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority. Finland' s experience, however, is that integration, rather than isolation, is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces. I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution, which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights. The EU Presidency' s ""common reaction"" against the formation of the government in Austria is legally unjustified. The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States. Nor should we isolate the forces in Austria which wish to work for human rights. Despite these objections of mine to the Council' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactics, it was important to show clearly where the European Parliament stands on questions of racism, which is why I voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote. That concludes the vote. Adjournment of the session"	fr
Of course, if consensus could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference, there might eventually be progress. It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this. We will soon see, and for our part, we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue. Mr President, I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency. I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it, you would consider it. Well, I, and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it. I appreciate that it is a provocative question. It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves. We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens. I cannot think of a better way to do it. Can you? The issue is whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the Treaties. This is an issue which, as you will understand, will have to be addressed at IGC level and is an issue that only a Special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue, because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place. Intergovernmental Conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree. It is therefore not out of the question that these issues, which crop up again and again, and which are passed from one conference to another, may be addressed. The problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue being included, particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included, other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference' s agenda. Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion. I would ask him to be brief. Mr President, I understand that I have to do this very quickly. I liked what Mr Seixas da Costa said about Father Christmas. In Spain they say a letter to the three kings. I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports. Now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings. As I suspected, it was not exactly a procedural motion, but more a closing of the debate. We thank Mr Seixas da Costa, but he can also write his letter to the three kings. I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one. The problem is that in this case Father Christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so.	de
"The Commission is not able to approve the first section of Amendment No 14. If the word ""untreated"" were to be deleted, it would no longer be possible to use mixed household waste in co-incinerators, something which would also apply to waste which had undergone extensive pre-treatment. The second section of this amendment is, in principle, acceptable. By introducing an explanation of the word ""untreated"" , the paragraph can be made less ambiguous. The European Parliament' s Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 7, which are aimed at introducing provisions concerning the treatment of waste, cannot, for reasons of principle, be approved. The Commission' s proposal is aimed at introducing limits for emissions and at establishing operative conditions for all waste incinerated or co-incinerated, and this should not influence the legislation concerning the treatment of waste. The Commission is not able to approve Amendments 5 and 15 which are designed to introduce links to standards of air and water quality. Legislation of this kind already exists or is at present being prepared, for example the directives concerning air quality and coordinated measures to prevent and limit pollution, together with the proposed framework directive concerning water. The amendments would involve the provisions in these acts being duplicated or becoming more ambiguous. Amendments Nos 3, 16, 30 and 33-35 are not compatible with the directive' s structure and cannot therefore be approved. There has been a certain amount of confusion concerning Amendment No 13 where a number of language versions have been changed but not the English language version. This amendment cannot, however, be adopted by the Commission. Articles 12 and 15 of the proposal concern access to information and reporting. They are now worded in such a way as to guarantee that all players have access to the information they require. The Commission therefore considers that Amendments Nos 20 and 21 are unnecessary. Amendments Nos 36-39 are designed to tighten up the requirements with regard to measurements. The Commission is not able to accept these because they would place an additional burden upon those responsible and because no justification of their real value can be provided. Finally, Annexes II, IV and V are, as you know, the heart of the Directive, establishing the limits for emissions in the cases of coincineration and incineration. As I have already mentioned, the Commission accepts the proposed limit of 500 milligrams for nitric oxides in new cement kilns. This is also justified from the point of view of cost-income analysis. Any further amendment for the purpose of making the limits stricter or of removing from certain plants the right to be regarded as exceptions would threaten the delicate balance achieved in the common position. The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments Nos 23, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32 40, 41 and 42. With regard to Mrs Jackson' s question about the incineration of dead animals on farms, I would provide the following clarification. The incineration of dead animals is not included under the directive, and this in accordance with the exceptions defined in Article 2.2."	el
"When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen. I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon. On 14 February, we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000. This is a big task but it can be done. I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement. In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important ""Amsterdam leftovers"" . These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe. In relation to the latter point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining. We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission. I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point. At the IGC, we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution. We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty. In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions. So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully. We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents. The Treaty of Amsterdam, Mr President, has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe. Mr President, I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution, which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible. In any case, this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon. I think that, under the present rules of the Treaties, the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation. On the contrary, we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms, in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposals are worthy of note. We must use dialogue at every political level, including of course dialogue with the national parliaments. That way, we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms. Parliament' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that, with the Union' s institutional changes, we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union. They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone. The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive. It may be easy to come up with solutions, but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term. I will mention two point that may create tension. One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries. Europe is not, nor can it become a classic federal state. The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union, which is a union of states and peoples. The other area of conflict is more difficult. Owing to the imminent increase in membership, the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective. This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly. By its very nature, however, the European Union is, and will remain, a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution. Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist. Of course they do, but they are not unlimited. If the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness, then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer. I am, however, optimistic."	fi
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services. The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises. The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr Wieland on this - are essential, for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts. Why do I think we need the directive so much? Three reasons and they are as follows: on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU, in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market. Therefore, whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions, I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible. My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission. Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations? How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view, as this will have important implications, notably for the accession negotiations and for our country, which shares common borders with so many applicant countries? Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, did not apply to them. Indeed, they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided. There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory. I assume that, although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known, their number will most definitely not be low. So, up to now, their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation. The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card. It seems important, in this respect, to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner, namely within five days of a simple declaration' s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided; and that, also to prevent misuse, this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended. I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner. Having also studied the amendments submitted, I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow. May I, to finish off, thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having, in that way, added an important degree of meaning to her report?	fr
If it is then a question of listing the areas investigated or researching these, they can be found with the rapporteurs, among them the author of the report on this convention. I thus believe that Mr Schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks. As I have said, numerous amendments have been incorporated which guarantee the rights of the defence - I am thinking here of the obligation for interceptions to be requested by a judge - or the prohibition on holding both an investigative and a judicial mandate as part of a joint investigation team. In brief, this Parliament wanted the convention to apply solely to criminal matters; the restrictions on freedom and on fundamental rights set out in the convention can but be limited to criminal matters. We need hard and fast rules. The Council has behaved in an unseemly manner, changing tack in mid-course, and is nowhere to be seen. We would, on the other hand, like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for attending the debate held in this Chamber. As I have said, we need hard and fast rules if we are to have fair trials in Europe - without intrusion from interceptions, without the illicit use of video conferences - because we in Europe should no longer have trials run by magistrates who play politics rather than administer justice, and because punishment should be meted out to the real perpetrators of crime and not to innocent people who someone finds inconvenient. . Mr President, the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is approaching adoption by the Council. Most say it is about time. According to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the Council in April 1997, the work on the draft MLA Convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997. More time will pass before the Convention actually enters into force, given the fact that this requires Member States' ratification. Even with the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, foreseeing its entry into force once at least half of the Member States have adopted the Convention, I would like to urge the Member States to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this Convention. Past experience with ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing. This Convention will not create a new or different system of Mutual Assistance. Instead it aims at building on tried and tested mechanisms that have been in place for a very long time, such as the ones foreseen by the Council of Europe Convention on mutual assistance of 1959 and the Benelux Treaty. The draft that the Council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several Members of Parliament. It is a considerable achievement of the Convention that where at all possible requested Member States shall comply with the formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting Member States. This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court. Furthermore, requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities. Generally speaking, there are two kinds of provisions: those that create an obligation to render assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences, controlled deliveries and on the interception of telecommunications; and those where no such obligation is created and only a legal framework is provided for Member States that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribed, for example, the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert investigations and the sending and service of procedural documents. The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime. It is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations. However, one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence. I very much appreciate that the report of Mr Di Pietro, whom I salute for the excellent work he has done in such a short period of time, includes the right of defence as one of its main points.	fi
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions. At the end of the day, one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue. Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts. But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord. Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses, monopolies law being one example. But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation. Competition yes, restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible. However, since state aid forms the lion' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like, regardless of Mr Jonckheer' s report, to say one more thing about it. It is certainly possible, indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy. Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition. This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible. It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives. My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties. The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors, according to various typologies, such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued. Let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid, on average, for the period under review, is in the order of EUR 95 billion, corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995, a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany. To put it plainly, the level of state aid declared, roughly speaking, is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent, coincidentally, of the Community budget for one year.	fr
"What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making? What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes, so too of course do the types of decisions made. When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender, the word ""qualifications"" also crops up. What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined. It often looks as if men today, as in the past, always have the least defined qualifications. Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence. This way of seeing things I consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today' s decision makers. Earlier this year, we requested, here in this Chamber, that 8 March be made into an international holiday. In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the ""Women' s World Marches"" which are to begin this spring on International Women' s Day. This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world. Finally, I want to say, as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close, that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother. We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found. Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness. Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics. It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible. In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors. The vast majority of them are not members of any party. In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories. In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected. But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates. Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union. That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities. The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system. On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses. The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women. With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions. It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation. The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs. On the other hand, such a policy shows a deep contempt for women."	de
In matters of the environment, investment and ambition come in a variety of forms, and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term. This is the price of the future of generations to come. Mr President, Commissioner, I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that, as far as the Council is concerned, the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE. I shall therefore reiterate that, as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly, LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union' s policy on the environment. This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States. This financial instrument is, furthermore, deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisations. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of LIFE. Through the associations, then, LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly, and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community. Several million NGO members - millions, I say - recognise in LIFE the Union' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage. LIFE is, moreover, the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe into which the Member States have put a lot, pursuant to Community directives on the habitats of rare and endangered fauna and flora and on migratory birds, and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our States. I should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own States bear the responsibility for obstructing European nature conservation policies. This is a pity because everyone within this Chamber knows that LIFE is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by Member States, a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds. Let us not forget that, to date, LIFE amounts to only EUR 100 million per annum, i.e. scarcely 0.1% of the budget of the European Union. For the record, the budget for agriculture, which has a real impact on the environment, amounts, as we all know, to EUR 37 billion. Against this background, my group thinks it essential to increase the allocation to LIFE and unreservedly supports Mrs Lienemann' s proposal to increase the budget to EUR 850 million, since we know, and I think it bears saying, how high the expectations of our fellow citizens on environmental matters are and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the Council' s compromise regarding the budget for LIFE is, especially as the LIFE programmes show exceptional implementation rates and have demonstrated the extent to which they made it possible to bring about new environmental practice. The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those. Mr President, the European Union environmental programme, to which a considerable amount (EUR 613 million) has been allocated, gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds. A financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective, and this is not the case for the following reasons: poorly defined selection criteria, dubious uncoordinated operations, assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy.	de
Mr President, everyone who has travelled here by car, train or aeroplane, has been able to see the extent of the damage, particularly in France, caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month. What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster? Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who, on a daily basis, have had to reassure their constituents, organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services. They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens. Next, I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union' s Member States who, in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation, came to support the efforts of their French colleagues. I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid. If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims, but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so. We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly. I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies, which have been particularly badly hit. As you said, Commissioner, we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to FIFG for investments that have been totally wiped out. Beyond this, I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected. I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and, on the contrary, to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments, which they urgently need. Mr President, the storms which devastated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused, as has been said, 90 deaths and damage to a value of FF 75 billion, i.e. EUR 11 billion. Almost three weeks after the disaster, several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones, 500 000 hectares of forestry land, or 100 million cubic metres of forest, have been ruined, and our historical heritage has also been affected, as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates. It seems quite natural that given such a disaster, national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected. As the previous speakers have said, and as you said, Commissioner, in response to my fellow Member, Mr Martinez, with regard to another tragedy, the floods in November in the Southwest of France, you have certainly noted these disasters with concern, but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued, which has resulted in this shocking paradox. This paradox, pointed out by the previous speaker, is that it is easier, a great deal easier, to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the Union than within it. We know full well that what you are doing, Commissioner, and that is, limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b. These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000. I can show you a copy if you wish. We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission, but also of this Parliament, and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so. But for pity' s sake, and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way, please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms. As a matter of urgency, therefore, we must restore, within the framework of a supplementary budget, the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters. We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union. That, however, is another problem altogether.	fi
I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy? The fabric of Turkey' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities. That would seem odd to me. Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door. Will they also take part in our defence policy? It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least. High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force. However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further. I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference. A word of warning to the latter: this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation. We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management. At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing. Do you think that any of these issues could be included, at least in the agenda of the current Conference? Mr Solana, I am sitting quite close to you, close enough to see your face. I think that you have aged, your face is quite lined. It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers, as Mrs Maes just put it, and what you do not say. You bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another bout of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and yet you have stood up here, while blood is being spilled in Kosovo, and you have not said a word about it. You are Spanish; you are from a large country, Mr Solana. Spain and Franco were not one and the same. Spain maintained its unity, it kept the Basque country and Andalucia and Catalonia and it did well to do so, because no one identified Spain with Franco and no one played around with Spain' s unity in the name of a Fascist dictator. Today, you are identifying Yugoslavia with Milosevic and you are playing with Voivodina, with Montenegro and with southern Serbia. It is you who has created this mess.	de
Secondly, I should like to say that there is a rule here, that it is standard practice to vote up to 1.30 p.m. on Thursdays and to leave the rest until 6.00 p.m., after the urgent votes. We have done so for years and we can be flexible one way or the other pretty much as we please. Perhaps all the members should be reminded of that. Members are supposed to work here through to Friday, so that we can use the afternoons to see our visitors. Mr President, perhaps I can be of help here. The rapporteur has stated that she agrees with your suggestion, i.e. with the President' s suggestion. Allow me to recapitulate: the President said that we are to vote at 5.30 this evening on whether or not to postpone the vote until the next plenary session. Please let us proceed thus. Sarah Ludford has stated that she agrees with that. So, we vote at 5.30 p.m. on postponing the Ludford report to the next plenary session. That is my motion. There is absolutely no problem with that. It is well within the Rules. It can be done immediately before the vote. It is normal procedure. That is why I cannot take it now. The Rules say you move postponement before the vote on the matter. That concludes the votes. EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Graefe zu Baringdorf report (A5-0044/2000)  We need to pay close attention to the issue of animal health, particularly that of bovine animals and swine, hence the importance of sanitary inspections in intra-Community trade in these species. This approach must also take account of the need to put more effort into the total eradication of diseases like leucosis, tuberculosis and brucellosis, and into adequate health procedures. But it is also vital to remember that producers need proper support, with special attention being paid to small farms and family farming given that, as in Portugal, the already low incomes of small farmers are often profoundly affected by these diseases and this is not generally made up for by the low level of compensation. So it is essential that intervention in future makes it possible to protect both the interests of consumers and the interests of producers, especially of small farmers. Ferrer report (A5-0066/2000) - (DA) We cannot vote in favour of the report since there are gross abuses of human rights in Mexico. That has most recently been demonstrated in an Amnesty report from December 1999 which draws attention to, among other things, the serious problems in the Chiapas region. We think it is splendid that the trade agreement has had built into it a demand to promote democracy in Mexico - including the observance of human rights - but, as long as this demand is not followed up by concrete action, it is merely a case of empty words. A democracy clause was also built into the old trade agreement with Mexico, but this was not complied with. Pressure must therefore be exerted upon Mexico through international organisations such as the UN and via individual nations. Only after that, and when there have been significant improvements in the area of human rights, do we think that we can enter into a new trade agreement with Mexico.	el
I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland, a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue. The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves, which have been totally rejected out of hand, for the conservation of their own fish stocks, then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard. At a recent visit in Brussels these fishermen' s representatives, duly accredited, travelled from Northern Ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared. That is scandalous, their case ought to be heard. It should be put on record, and I want to put it on record today. I sat in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the Irish Sea and at that very time haddock had a special, spectacular increase of breeding in the Irish Sea so the scientists can be wrong. As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ruination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union. Mr President, Mrs Attwooll' s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the Member States. This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002. However, the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the Commission' s proposal. This has happened, as previously mentioned, with the MAGPs. These have seriously prejudiced the countries which have strictly complied with them and provided the corresponding data to the Commission, compared with other countries which have failed to comply or simply not provided the data. It should be pointed out that not all the Member States have the same amount of data. Some have different sectors and, in view of the volume of data to be sent, could be prejudiced compared with those which have a smaller volume of data, if the same deadlines are set. These deadlines for submission must therefore be staggered accordingly. Much of this data is confidential, as has also been mentioned, which could affect the competitiveness of the sectors involved and their enterprises. We must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data. Some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises. Finally, Mr President, as I must be brief given the time constraints, I must congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, on the important work which she has carried out within our committee.	el
I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner' s statement; it is time that fine words were translated into action. We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves. I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems. It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this. Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process. In the meantime, we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures. We can learn from the successes mentioned, not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected, but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system. I am pleased to say that in Wales, which I represent, 40% of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but, on the other hand, we have only 4 women MPs from Wales in the House of Commons which is only 10% of the total; so statements of principle, of support in principle, are not enough because they have not worked. If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen. Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness. Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics. It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible. In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors. The vast majority of them are not members of any party. In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories. In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected. But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates. Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union. That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities. The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system. On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses. The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women. With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions.	el
But this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, if negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years. And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia, amongst the Balkan countries, three years hence. A few days ago Mr Racan announced that Croatia' s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000. There are bound to be other applications and this great work, this fine intellectual architecture, will crumble, left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former Yugoslavia for the past 20 years. This would not be so serious if this region of Europe were not so beset by the problems we are all aware of, problems which are being addressed, but which have not yet been resolved, by the new government of Macedonia. There are the problems of coexistence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, the connected problems of Kosovo, the notorious economic problems, the problems of being neighbour to a particularly developed mafia in Serbia, and then there is the problem of the Greek veto which must be condemned for what it is. After nearly 10 years, Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name, and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia. It is absolutely absurd. Apart from anything else it is offensive, in my opinion, to the Greek MEPs and the citizens of Greece. This question needs to be resolved urgently. Finally, by happy chance, a letter from Mr Georgievski, President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler, dated 8 March, has come into my hands. In it, referring to Article O, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union. Why has the Council not informed us of this? Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia? Mr President, Commissioner, the Balkans are not purely a dark cave, politically speaking. The decidedly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves. The gruesome escalation of ethnic violence in neighbouring Kosovo did not reach its territory. Paradoxically, but truly, the war in Kosovo Polje generated exactly the opposite effect: the perilous gap of confidence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority became decidedly smaller. From the point of view of the Macedonian majority, the Albanian minority behaved loyally towards the common state during the international explosion of the Kosovo conflict. In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo' s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme. This remarkable upshot of the Kosovar war negotiations can therefore justifiably be seen as the internal, political establishment of the Republic of Macedonia the second time round. Mr Swoboda' s well-balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level. In brief, the European Union knows what to do in Macedonia: to help this local port of refuge - recently used by scores of war refugees - to fulfil its role properly as a catalyst for the planned Stability Pact in the Balkans. Mr President, as one who has been concerned with Macedonia for eight years, I have to contradict Mr Dupuis. What we are doing here is not hypocritical. We have reached a propitious moment and I think the Macedonians are glad about it. Please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything. I think we should take a more positive approach here. Macedonia did not go through a war. But it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions, as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries. It suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war. So we must admit that developments in Macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines.	fi
"So I and many of my colleagues will be backing most of Mr Blokland's amendments because we want the highest possible standards. I have no problem at all if these prove technically difficult to achieve - no problem, because Britain has a shameful record of having the lowest household waste recycling in Europe and great room for improvement. Many of us believe that any government in our country will encourage the construction of waste incinerators as an alternative to encouraging the alternatives. It would be a case of ""throw it on the furnace"" and putting it out of sight and out of mind which to my mind is a false approach. We have to concentrate on reducing waste, recycling what is left and leaving incinerators as a last resort. Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Blokland for his report which strives to improve the Commission's proposal, and the authors of the other amendments which do so as well. But incineration has to be considered as a last resort and - as has been said already - waste reduction, re-use and recycling are the main things we should be striving for. I just wonder about Mr Bowe's statement about the need to reduce, recycle and re-use waste. Will his position remain the same when he is debating the packaging directive? It will be interesting to see if he sticks to his principles there. The only thing incineration does, as Mrs Evans has said, is to encourage the need for more waste. It will not be economically viable if you do not have enough waste to keep the incinerators going. We also must remember that waste does not disappear. It is turned into dioxins and also toxic ash - what will you do with that? In Ireland, some operators are proposing using it in building materials. What will be the long-term consequences of that? In Ireland, regardless of what my colleague Mr Hyland said, we have an appalling record on waste management. We have one of the highest landfill records in Europe. Now it seems the government are moving from landfill to incineration and it is being presented as the green option. They say: ""We are turning waste into energy - isn't that wonderful?"" when in actual fact they are trying to hoodwink the public into believing that this is something that is ecologically sound. The recent court case in Ireland which decided against the siting of an incinerator in an agricultural area was extremely important. It is very important that we get our act right, that we look first and foremost at waste management. For any government to propose that incineration should be introduced instead of landfill is completely misguided. We have to look at the root causes of why the waste is there in the first place. Mr President, the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy underline generally the high levels of environmental protection, and for that reason many of these amendments are acceptable. There are differing infrastructures for the treatment and incineration of waste in different countries, however, and, as a result, the same provisions are not in fact the same for everyone. In Finland and some other countries the sorting of waste in close proximity to where it originates is very advanced. Thus, we do not incinerate mixed waste, as they do in certain countries. The incineration of mixed waste is bad environmental policy. Sorted waste can be incinerated effectively together with other fuels in a so-called coincineration process. The amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy unjustifiably lump together the incineration of mixed waste with parallel incineration. That might have an adverse effect, as a result of its indirect economic impact, on levels of environmental protection in the countries that sort waste. For that reason, Amendments Nos 14, 17, 18 and 27 should not be adopted. Finally, I would like say that the cement industry lobby should not be put in a competitive position that is better than that enjoyed by the hazardous waste disposal plants. Mr President, I find myself in agreement with Mrs Grosset√™te and Mrs Paulsen and - rather alarmingly for both of us - with Mr Bowe. But I want to make a particular point in relation to an alarm which has been raised in the United Kingdom by the agricultural sector literally in the last few days."	fi
They have more first-hand knowledge of social needs. They have more involvement in the problems and, furthermore, they know how to conceive projects and implement them effectively without weighing them down with bureaucracy, and thereby achieve better results. Lastly, in today' s vote on our four amendments, two have been approved and the other two rejected. This has obliged us to abstain from the final vote, because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedicate, to URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which it has not spent in accordance with Community programmes. Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had an in-depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produced many ideas. As the smallest Community initiative in existence, we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected. We regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects. We should remember that it is these URBAN projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established. The Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place. It should make URBAN projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled 'sustainable urban policy' . Finally, there is currently still no European urban policy within the European Union. Perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reorganisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally has a true urban policy. Mr President, I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development, known as URBAN. As with all other Community initiatives, this is very positive. Europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State, whichever one it may be. URBAN is designed to find solutions to urban decay, and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pensioners' Party. There can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city. I hope that this Community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities. . (DA) The Left' s five Members of the European Parliament have chosen to support LEADER+, the EQUAL initiative and INTERREG, but not URBAN. At a forthcoming review of these programmes, it ought to be established that the EU' s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross-border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the EU. . (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for a Community initiative relating to the economic and social regeneration of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis and designed to promote sustainable development (URBAN). Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think, in general, that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations, as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects. This report contains general points on what is referred to as the urban regeneration strategy for town centres and neighbourhoods affected by the crisis in the capitalist economy and its consequences, i.e. increasing unemployment, exclusion and delinquency. It underlines the fact that, in order to ensure sustainable urban development, an urban policy must be implemented which does not leave out the main victims of the economic crisis, namely the unemployed, immigrants, refugees, women and the socially excluded. However, nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it.	fi
Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America. The Commission shares the growing concern about the missing Russian journalist, Mr Babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in Chechnya more generally. This issue comes on top of our deep worries about the plight of the civilian population in Chechnya, and I have heard Mr Posselt on this subject before. There are alarming reports of human rights violations. Of course, there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict. The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a European Union Troika d√©marche on the eleventh of this month. We underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the Russians to clarify the circumstances of Mr Babitsky' s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights. We await a proper response from the Russians. In the meantime, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council earlier this week have confirmed the message which I have given today. And we are ready to return to the issue at the EU-Russia Ministerial Troika in Lisbon on 2 March, if we need to do so. Finally, on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge: we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes. I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon. We vigorously supported the Troika d√©marche to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong on 4 February this year. The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders. At the same time, we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties. I am encouraged by the optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal. The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year. It has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days. I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead. Thank you very much Commissioner Patten. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m. Danube environmental disaster The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: B5-0164/2000 by Mr Leinen on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, B5-0167/2000 by Mr Maaten and Mrs Thors on behalf of the Group of the European Democrat and Reform Party, B5-0168/2000 by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Grosset√™te on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats,	fr
I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today. As I did not have an answer, I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December. I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it. I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and, in this case, passionate intervention. I would like to remind all of you that Spain is about to hold elections, and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections. It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time, since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again. I do believe it is important to say that Andalusia is going to receive 50% more within the Community support framework and that Spain also holds the record for the use of the Structural Funds, which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different Community support frameworks. Lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question: Do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable? This is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related. Having said this, we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union. I am pleased that the Structural Funds are the subject of discussions in Greece and Spain. We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens, about public debates. The more we talk about Europe and what Europe is doing for daily life, even when we disagree, the better this will be, provided that we talk about this objectively. I am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the Structural Funds Regulation. This Regulation was adopted just last year in Berlin and I will be applying it for the next seven years. We will talk about this issue during the cohesion report which I regard as an important time for making an assessment with and before this House and for outlining future prospects. The time will come at the beginning of next year for any amendments to be highlighted. For the time being, please let me apply the Regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in Berlin. This is all I can say today. Thank you very much for your replies, Mr Barnier. Questions Nos 48 to 50 will be replied to in writing. Question No 51 by (H-0049/00):  Subject: New premises for the OHIM At present the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) is still operating from the same temporary premises, even though its new building was opened in June 1999. In view of this unusual situation, will the Commission say why the OHIM has not yet moved to its new premises? The honourable Member asked a question on this topic in November 1999 and I would like to refer him to the answer given at the time.	el
"Firstly, I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team. This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area. Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster. I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes. Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year. How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it? How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds? How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which, as our resolution points out, causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster? While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards, we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed'. We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively. We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety. The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods. Just as the Sea Empress, just as the Braer did. It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster. My group's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster, just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions. Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea. The time for resolutions has passed. What is now needed is action. Sadly, I fear, the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster. Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again. In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future. The ""Erika"" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected, but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe. Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds, perhaps mainly guillemots, may have died. The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic. We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying. We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the ""polluter pays"" principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced."	fi
And a woman was elected. The second event took place in France, which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in April 1999 at the 'Women and Men in Power' conference, at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio. We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner. A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States. But the figures tell the true story. And the figures still give Europe cause for concern. 24% of members of government are women and there are an average of 22% in parliament, although this fluctuates from 6% in some Member States to as many as 40% in others. The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small. Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%. What we need, therefore, is to promote specific policies. We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively. We need organisation and statistical monitoring. We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture, mentality and specific problems of each area. And, of course, these policies need a budget, they need to be given financial teeth. Increasing the number of women or, as the French prime minister put it, increasing the influence of women in the decision-making centres, is the best way of renewing the policy, of reshaping the approach to the question, of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience: the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up. The recent initiative by the Finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision-making centres is extremely important. These indicators include national parliaments, regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every Member State. I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets, compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool. The programme which I shall present for the fifth women' s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring. Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned, the same cannot be said for the private sector. My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light. There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2% of the directors and managers are women.	fr
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that. I also welcome the White Paper. But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France's refusal to lift the ban? You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting. Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance, similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment? Mr President, you said during last week' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery was. For example, the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters. It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather, publish and coordinate data, make recommendations for improved food safety, and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers. All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union. I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location? In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time. In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board. You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board. This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months. I envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders. Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September. We have not done that yet but it will be done in September. I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work. That would erode the independence of the scientific advice. But it would have an overall remit, particularly, for instance, in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research. Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that. That is an issue for consideration and discussion. There may be a number of views on that. Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board.	fr
I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important. Let me repeat what I have said, we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming. I should now, Mr President, like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur, Francis Decourri√®re, in the same way that I thanked Arlene McCarthy, for the quality and relevance of his work. He stressed a number of points, with which we may indicate our agreement, as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands, cross-border, transnational, interregional; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG, its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures and what, in discussing another debate which begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen, and here, with INTERREG, thanks to INTERREG, is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners. Having made these general observations, I should like to focus on your main comments with regard to INTERREG. The first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative. You comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date, stressing, particularly your rapporteur, the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted. It is true, I admit it, and you are well aware of the reasons, ladies and gentlemen. There is a delay in adopting the INTERREG guidelines in March or April 2000. I accept this; I take note of it as you do. I note, however, that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for INTERREG III and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now. I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January, if the programme is presented before 30 April. So much for the first comment. As to the second comment: regarding the non-comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand B, I wish to inform you, to confirm, that I have asked the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects, particularly in favour of small- and medium-sized businesses and of cultural heritage, in the list of schemes eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one. Third point: interregional cooperation, the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C, interregional cooperation. As your rapporteur has requested, I shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand. Fourth observation: the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office. As you requested, I have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service outsourcing systems. But, ladies and gentlemen, if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TAO at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials' jobs needed to do this work, because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep redeploying the same staff indefinitely, at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre-accession structural instrument (ISPA) and in order to ensure that, the Community appropriations for which I am responsible, often in partnership or on terms of coresponsibility with Member States, are monitored better, with discipline and transparency.	fi
As such, the cost of the equipment for continuous sampling is recouped within the space of a few years. At first reading, considerable improvements were made to the Commission proposal thanks to a great deal of support. It was at that stage that expectations were raised amongst the citizens. I strongly urge MEPs to meet these expectations. A consistent approach taken by the European Parliament will benefit our credibility amongst the citizens, especially those citizens living in the vicinity of plants which incinerate or co-incinerate waste. Mr President, Commissioner, we feel that this directive is far from satisfactory because it involves a combination of two texts, one on the incineration of dangerous waste and the other on the incineration of non-dangerous waste. This raises problems for us at several phases of the incineration process: the reception, processing and handling of the waste. One might well ask what was the point of combining these two matters. We can find the answer in Mr Blokland' s report, which is violently opposed to the coincineration industry. Paradoxically, however, by the same token, the rapporteur is in favour of mixing dangerous and non-dangerous waste. What is the advantage of this for the environment? Our Group has no wish to favour either type of industry, since both are extremely useful to waste management in Europe. The practices of each Member State must be taken into consideration, while maintaining the existing industrial balance and investigating how the environment can be better protected. This is what the common position proposes. Priority must be given to the emission limits for the most harmful substances, i.e. NOx, dioxins and furanes. Moreover, the common position suggests an NOx limit value for the incineration of dangerous waste for the year 2007. Such a thing does not yet currently exist. As regards dioxins and furanes, the limit values have now been made mandatory for all types of waste. Until now, they applied only to non-dangerous waste. It is therefore unfortunate that the Blokland report is putting unrealistic solutions forward when it is known that a good many directives on waste management are not yet applied or are not properly applied by Member States. If one wishes to go too far, one becomes counter-productive. It is completely unrealistic to wish to review the limit values of this directive every three years, if one considers the considerable investment that the industry would have to make. What the industry needs is legal certainty and reasonable time periods. The real problem is that in Europe we do not have a proper definition of what waste is, resulting in ongoing confusion when we have to revise a text on waste or to present new proposals. Commissioner, waste management in Europe must undergo complete reform as a matter of urgency. Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Blokland on this report. We know that waste incineration is a very difficult and highly technical area, but I think that a creditable piece of work has been done in connection with this report. Unlike Mrs Grosset√™te, I think that the common position and Mr Blokland' s report will, as a matter of fact, make a significant environmental contribution in connection with waste incineration, whether we are talking about hazardous or non-hazardous waste.	el
The consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming ashore. These consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself. The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance. They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which, unfortunately, is not an isolated event. The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature, which is nowadays too often being punished by man' s activities. These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities. Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes. Surely the budget would agree, as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these. Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked. Yet on the issue of the Erika he has given the impression, perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vend√©e, that, as the Fisheries Commissioner, he is not always available or, at best, available only on a part-time basis. As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January, the needs of the severely affected fisheries, ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account. We therefore now call upon the Commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds. Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks. We cannot understand how it is that experiences like the Urquiola or Amoco Cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience. Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this. We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen. The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate. It is time that polluters started to pay because, up to now, it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid, and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well. I am therefore delighted at Mr Fischler' s response, particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted. On behalf of the PSE Group, I want to send a message of solidarity to those affected, to the fishermen, farmers and businesspeople who enable the products of the sea to be regularly brought to market. My message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians, to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support.  I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner. Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable.	de
"Mr President, I share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the services offered. But as an entrepreneur myself, I really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of ""privatisation"" and ""liberalisation""! Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all, but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations. Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy. In practice that means the following for the postal services: firstly, priority must be given to employment. I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right. Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services. Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk. Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union. So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent. Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days. On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying. We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile. In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset. Mr President, the 1997 directive, issued on 21 January 1998, which undertook the partial liberalisation of postal services in Europe, envisaged a revision at a later date, in a rather convoluted manner, indeed, since it was to be dealt with in a Commission proposal by the end of 1998, then decided by 1 January 2000, to come into force finally by 1 January 2003. Well, for the time being, the revision has not got off the starting block. The two initial phases were not observed which, logically, ought to compromise the third. My first question is this: surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case? Apparently, they were. It is really not possible to see how the Commission could by the end of 1998, as stipulated by Article 7 of the directive, have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year."	fr
That position recalled that the fisheries agreement which expired in November 1999 applied to Morocco's fishing zone which is defined as waters over which Morocco has sovereignty or jurisdiction. This definition does not in any way affect the status of Western Sahara and its coastal waters. This is a matter which falls under international law, and in particular various UN resolutions, and the responsibility of the UN Secretary-General, whose efforts to find a just, equitable and durable solution have been consistently supported by the European Union. I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner for his kind answer, although I find it to be completely insufficient. The letter which I referred to in my question was very unclear as to the European Commission' s conception of the coastal waters of the Western Sahara. However, you have expressed it with extreme clarity?. There is no doubt that the Kingdom of Morocco is currently occupying the Western Sahara and this territory is currently undergoing a process of self-determination. However, according to international law, it should be considered that Morocco has control over that territory, although it in no way has sovereignty over it. If it cannot have sovereignty over the territory, neither can it have sovereignty over its coastal waters. This would prejudice the future of those waters, given the possibility that the planned referendum on self-determination will support the independence of that territory. What situation would the Government of the Western Sahara then be in with regard to the waters which it would have the sovereign duty to administrate? I agree absolutely that we should reach a fisheries agreement with Morocco which is favourable to the interests of the European Union fishing fleet, in particular the Spanish fishing industry. But I believe this is not contradictory, on the contrary, with a legitimate interpretation of international law which I ask to be done formally. Does the Commission commit itself to formally consulting the Secretary-General of the United Nations? Yes or no, Commissioner? I have many regrets in life and one of them is that I am not a lawyer, so if the honourable gentleman will excuse a scriptural reference, I tip toe on these waters with some nervousness! But I understand that international law is quite clear and that the question of territorial waters is directly related to the question of the sovereignty of a territory itself. That is a question which is being considered at the moment in the context of the referendum and of the UN Secretary-General's initiative. As I am sure the honourable gentleman knows, we strongly support that initiative and if there is any way that we can assist the UN Secretary-General, then we would certainly want to do so. That also goes, of course, for his special representative. As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 40 and 113 will be taken together, at the request of the Commission. Question No 40 by (H-0241/00):  Subject: Landmines In a recent statement in the UN General Assembly the Council Presidency stated that the EU remains the main contributor to de-mining programmes worldwide.	el
Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America. Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr √Ålvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region. However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki. I will speak of this briefly. If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them. The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago. Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent. These were essentially of three types which I will describe. The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management. The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union' s relations with third countries and other organisations. This basically involves relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and relations between the European Union and those countries which, although geographically in Europe, are not part of the European Union, or at least not at the moment. I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events. Firstly, with regard to the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning, 1 March 2000. This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council. Therefore, two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision, a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union. I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch. You can be satisfied with the progress made. The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months. Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration. This Military Committee, as you can imagine, will have various duties. In the interim stage, its basic duty will be to advise the Council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will, of course, try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next.	de
Whatever system is adopted, ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer. The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars. The manufacturers have tricked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals. Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers! If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments. Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is not a technical debate, contrary to what we may think. It has become eminently political. Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate. Today, if 314 Members of Parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers, we should be doing ourselves dishonour. In expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicles, as Amendment No 38 stipulates, even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer, Parliament would, for the first time, not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of Europe, it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies. We cannot accept this. It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas. It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position, whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough. The free recovery system, for example, for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly. Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council' s common position definitely must not be amended. It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable. Mr President, like so many others here today, I believe this is a good measure. This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need. Most of the technical issues have been resolved. There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved. We have arrived at the final question. In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament. That is quite simply: Who pays? The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost, not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said. In fact perhaps as little, the lawyers tell us, as 20% or one-fifth of the cost. That is not unreasonable. If you look at the UK consumer for example, who buys a Rover, as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars, over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should they pay? They have paid already.	el
Although I have signed this question, as an elected representative, I must say that I am not really its author. As the Commissioner can imagine, the question is posed by farmers, in the European countryside, who are wondering, at this stage, whether they, their income and their Community aid, will have to pay the price of enlargement. The Commissioner has not been explicit. However, his services, the Commission, and some of us MEPs, all know that there are studies and estimates covering this issue. The Commissioner is, at times, the master of side-stepping the question, with all the skill of a bullfighter, and failing to provide an answer. However, the Commission, if it wants the countryside to support its positions, must clear the fog, and be explicit. Therefore, I would ask the Commission, if it does not want to talk of its data and studies - which exist - at least to calm this real fear of the farmers and reply as to whether the cost of enlargement will be met at the expense of the farmers' income and, furthermore, whether he can guarantee that it will not have an effect on Community aid. Mr President, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I believe it should not come as news to you that farmers' revenue does not just consist of subsidies, rather they must earn most of it on the market. Therefore the comparison you have just drawn is inappropriate to my mind. Secondly, these are two completely different questions. In your question, which I answered, you asked what enlargement will cost. The question as to whether the Common Agricultural Policy will be amended in the course of enlargement, is an entirely different matter. All I can tell you today is that the CAP that was adopted in Berlin for the next seven years, still holds good. In addition, a financial perspective was adopted in Berlin, i.e. we decided how much money we could spend. You raised the idea of studies: the first studies were made several years back, and we sent these to Parliament. We are in the process of carrying out new studies and as soon as we have the results, we will be more than happy to make them available to you. Question No 50 by (H-0190/00): Subject: Balance between fisheries agreements in the North and South The Fisheries Council of October 1997 analysed the imbalance between fisheries agreements in the North and South, given that shipowners fishing under agreements with countries of the South are increasingly required to co-finance the agreements, which are free of charge for shipowners in the case of the North. It also analysed the fact that agreements with northern countries are under-utilised, despite the interest shown by other Member States in making use of these fishing opportunities. The Council therefore asked the Commission to consider decisions allowing quotas to be transferred from one Member State to another and to examine by what means the financial costs of agreements should be 'equitably shared, on a non-discriminatory basis,' between the Community and shipowners. Can the Commission say what studies it has carried out on the possibility of transferring quotas and what the outcome was? What decisions have been taken to balance the financial cost of agreements with the North and South? What is the Commission's assessment of the above-mentioned imbalances between these two types of agreement? I have asked a question because I previously consulted a series of decisions taken by the Council of Ministers in 1997 on certain guidelines for fisheries agreements and, as far as I can see, they have not yet been complied with in the European Union. I do not wish to have an argument with the Commissioner, but I simply wish to know whether, following the guidelines laid down at the time, on the next renewal of the fisheries agreement with Greenland - where we all know that fishing quotas are not used or are under-used - the fleets which do not have access at the moment to this agreement, will be offered the possibility of using those quotas which are not used or which are under-used. I actually referred to this at the beginning of my answer. It is certainly a problem, for although the Commission shares your view in principle, Mrs Fraga Est√©vez, that under-utilised quotas should be transferable, we still lack the necessary arrangements for doing so, because the Member States will not give their consent.	fi
It is true that economic aid is, in this respect, certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level. Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we, the Members of the European Parliament, must fulfil our own obligations in this regard, while ensuring, of course, that we are not the only ones to do so. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for his report. If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on. The Council' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret. The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should, and must, provide help swiftly, however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random. I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point, which clearly emphasises that it is only possible, and permissible, to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public, communal and other authorities and institutions, which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK. Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations, in particular Pillar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place. What is to be done with this money? I would like to highlight the issue of human rights. The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today? We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit. Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians. I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life. These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated. I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo. There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again. It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo. It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo. What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together.	fr
"I should not, however, wish to start thinking about this until our present initiative regarding essentially all products has reached a sufficiently advanced and credible stage, following talks with our commercial partners, to be able to move on to the next stage. I should specify, finally, that access to the market is not the only requirement for countries that, occasionally, do not have a sufficient export capacity for internal reasons, be they distribution, logistical or transportation capacities. It is therefore necessary to look at what is termed 'capacity building' , i.e. technical assistance measures to be implemented in order to ensure that this access is tangible and not just theoretical. This is the response I wished to give to this question which looks to the future. I am grateful to Commissioner Lamy for his answer, as far as it went. I certainly agree with what he said in the last part of his answer about the need for capacity-building in the least developed countries as well as, perhaps the need for asymmetrical measures, resulting in a certain level of protection for their markets that we do not seek to enjoy in return. But my main concern in asking the question - and I do not feel this has been fully dealt with - is over this matter of exactly what ""essential products"" means. Commissioner Lamy talks about certain agricultural products, but it has been precisely the protectionism of the common agricultural policy that has most offended developing countries and which has held back development for many of those countries in terms of agricultural production. What more specific comments can he make about which sectors and which products will be concerned, and for how long? That is the sort of message we want to hear. I wonder whether it would not be a better step forward, in terms both of winning the confidence of the developing countries and of acting as an example to other trading partners, for us, as Europe, to say: ""now is the time; we are going to offer this now. We do not want to wait for five years; let others follow our example"". There are two parts to my answer to this question. Firstly, I think I gave a clear answer to your question when I said that the difference between 'all' and 'essentially all' affected only a really very limited number of agricultural products. I am thinking particularly of sugar which can effectively constitute an additional resource for several of these countries. You know that the Community, and in this case the Commission, has considered the idea of a complete review of conditions in the sugar industry. These are matters to which we shall no doubt return. But that is something that only we need concern ourselves with. Regarding the more comprehensive initiative that we have undertaken, I would like to try to convince you that at this stage it is more important, as far as these least developed countries are concerned, that the Community should persuade the United States, Japan and a number of developed countries to follow our initiative because, in terms of real export capacity, this initiative opens up a market to them which is, roughly, twice or three times larger than our own."	el
Once again, I would like to reiterate my appreciation of the quality of work carried out, not only by the rapporteur, but by the committee as a whole. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. Closing of the session I declare the 1999-2000 session closed. (The sitting was closed at 10.41 p.m.) Opening of the session I declare resumed the 2000-2001 session of the European Parliament. Agenda Mr President, the second item on this morning' s agenda is the recommendation for second reading on cocoa and chocolate products, for which I am the rapporteur. Quite by accident I learnt yesterday, at 8.30 p.m., that the vote was to take place at noon today. It was however initially scheduled, I thought, for noon tomorrow. I have therefore been caught completely off guard by this, and have not even had the chance to draw up the lists of votes and to see whether there are any roll-calls or not. You know as well as I do that this matter is quite controversial and well reported in the media. I have been a Member of this Parliament for ten years and I have always been given notice, in my capacity as rapporteur, of any changes to the order of voting. I should prefer for this vote to be held tomorrow. It would suit me, personally, and I do not think anyone would have any objection, since it is a relatively brief vote. Mr President, we do not have anything against postponing the vote. However, I insist on the other scheduled votes, particularly those on the Lisbon Summit, going ahead tomorrow. We have nothing against postponement, with this proviso. The competent services have informed me that tomorrow' s list of subjects will be rather lengthy. Mr President, like Mr Lannoye, late last night I too was faced with the fact that the vote on my report at second reading is planned for 12.00 p.m. The groups have emphatically asked me to urge you not to let the vote take place at 12.00 p.m. but tomorrow instead, as they have not had the chance to apply for split and roll-call votes. After all, it came as a complete surprise that the vote was planned for 12.00 p.m. I would therefore ask, also on behalf of many others, to postpone the vote until tomorrow. Mr Blokland, the officials of the competent services have informed me that your report will automatically be put to the vote tomorrow. I now ask the House whether it agrees to postpone the vote on the Lannoye report until tomorrow. If we are all in agreement, that is what the arrangement will be. Annual legislative programme (continuation) The next item is the continuation of the debate on the European Commission' s annual legislative programme for the year 2000. Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, if the citizens of Europe are looking for this kind of Europe, then Brussels, and especially the Commission, is where they will look. Being a parliamentarian, that does not please me, but I have to accept the situation, for the moment at least, and until further notice. But this also means that the Commission faces an immense challenge. If you want to bring about the great turning point you mentioned, Mr President of the Commission, then you had better make a start on this damn quickly.	de
I am also delighted to be able to confirm that I shall be participating in the Joint Assembly' s next meeting, which takes place in March in Nigeria. The Commission is pleased to see the Joint Assembly playing a larger role, especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development. The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty continues to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role. In order to be able to develop, the countries concerned must, however, become actively involved in the global economic system. With regard to trade with our partners in development, the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries' special economic and social limitations. Mrs Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continued with. I do not agree. That system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is, in actual fact, of use only to relatively few of the 71 countries concerned. It operates too slowly, and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future, because this will operate more flexibly. Regarding the future accession of countries such as East Timor to the Lom√© Convention, I can only repeat what I recently said to the European Parliament' s Committee on Development and Cooperation, namely, that the door is open. It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door. Once they have done so, we shall adopt a position on the matter. With regard to Cuba' s application for accession to the Lom√© Convention, the Commission notes that, according to their recent declaration, the ACP States support Cuba' s application. The EU has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards Cuba, as outlined in the EU' s common position, but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex. With regard to the C√¥te d' Ivoire, I can inform you that the whole of the EUR 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities. With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget, I can say that this is being considered. For its part, the Commission supports this, but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the whys and wherefores. Concerning Article 366A, I can say that, during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement, a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed. It is now the case, following adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty, that Parliament wishes, on the basis of Article 300, to be kept fully informed of all decisions, and the Commission will continue to take account of Parliament' s decisions on this subject. There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions. This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty. Finally, I would refer to the South Africa agreement, which the rapporteur also touched upon. In this regard, I am simply pleased - delighted, in fact - here this evening, as a conclusion to this debate, to be able, very appropriately, to inform you that South Africa' s President has today said yes to the solution which the EU' s Council of Foreign Ministers last Monday agreed unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problems regarding South Africa.	de
It is one thing to prescribe sound environmental standards but quite another to comply with these. Compliance requires adequate control which, in turn, requires proper monitoring. Just imagine a situation in which we laid down excellent standards for emissions of dangerous substances such as dioxins but, on the other hand, left the way open for exemptions from all kinds of monitoring obligations. We would then run the risk of not, on balance, making any progress, and the quality of air would not improve. In addition, we also need to avoid a situation where it becomes clear there are long-term health risks for a reason which may not be immediately obvious, namely that the emission of harmful substances is not measured. We cannot justify the occurrence of illnesses, such as cancer or blood diseases, which we have not prevented because there was no obligation to measure the emission of harmful substances by incineration plants. Mr Florenz was among those who were right to point out that clear measuring regulations are vital. I expect, therefore, that we will be joining forces in order to put a sound monitoring process in place. As far as the scope of the directive is concerned, I am pleased to say that, thanks to good mutual cooperation, we have reached an acceptable wording. However, we need to bear in mind that, with this draft, we have deviated a long way from the first reading, in view of the fact that only untreated timber was then regarded as an acceptable exception. Regarding the definition of coincineration plant, it is unfortunate that we were unable to reach agreement on this beforehand. After many discussions involving various Members and the European Commission, a simple solution, which may well be acceptable, has been found in the form of Amendment No 43. If waste were used as a replacement raw material, such as in the recycling of glass, the relevant process would fall outside the scope of the directive. If, on the other hand, only part of the waste were to be used as a replacement raw material, then this process would fall within the directive' s scope. As for the recycling of energy, I would like to point out that, in November of last year, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the integration of environmental concerns into energy policy, in which it was requested that special attention be given to the application and development of the best methods for energy recycling. Consequently, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has made a recommendation that energy recycling by means of combined electricity/heat production should also apply to the incineration of waste. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has asked for ammonia levels to be measured. It is wrong, however, that the standards for ammonia should not apply to all installations. Accordingly, I have, for reasons of consistency, proposed an ammonia standard for cement kilns and for ordinary waste incinerators. As far as the continuous sampling of dioxins is concerned, this appears to be quite feasible. Belgium has started to use such a measuring technique in the wake of its dioxin crisis. A cumulative sample is taken for a one-month period. After this period, this sample is measured and the result gives a good indication of the levels of dioxin emitted during that month. Needless to say, this is a more effective monitoring method than the random measurement method used twice a year. According to experts, the costs are not higher since the measurement of cumulative samples is far cheaper.	el
This basis must include minimum conditions for access to Community waters and ports with regard to the age and characteristics of vessels; a general principle of environmental responsibility making it possible to determine the liability of the various operators, and particularly that of the charterer, and to impose heavy penalties. The Commission should ensure the coordination of information. It should not be afraid to confront the lax attitude of some major ports or major shipowners, and should make the issue of flags of convenience a central concern in the negotiations with Malta and Cyprus. Let me remind you that the Erika was registered in Valletta. All the same, States must clearly not shift their own essential responsibility onto the Union: the safety of all concerned is conditional upon the standards and effectiveness of inspection by the port State (and the resources made available for this). We must, and shall, remain particularly vigilant in the months to come in order to ensure that the victims who bear none of the responsibility whatsoever for this disaster receive compensation in full from the polluter, and to ensure that this time we do in fact learn the lessons from the oil slick in terms of maritime safety, so that polluters are deterred once and for all from gambling with the lives of our coastal populations. The most effective form of prevention is to ensure that any potential polluter is made liable to extremely heavy financial penalties. Katiforis report (A5-0017/2000) We agree that the fishing industry has the most to gain from promoting respect for the marine environment. We must nevertheless bear in mind that there are many factors that contribute to damaging marine areas, such as contamination and pollution by oil tankers and other maritime transport, industrial activity, the pressure of human activity on coastal waters and, of course, uncontrolled fishing activity. It is worth emphasising, however, that small-scale coastal fishing is a good example of how fishing activity can be combined with sustainable development that does not threaten the marine environment. We feel that it is possible to create a fisheries management policy based on conserving the marine environment which is compatible with the interests of fishing communities. But in order for this to happen, we must specifically take account of the fact that there is a correlation between income from fishing and an increase in fishing effort. It is therefore necessary to adopt measures under the common fisheries policy and to provide appropriate financial resources to guarantee the income of those who depend entirely on fishing for their livelihood, such as fishermen, particularly at times when fishing activity is suspended or reduced. Hence the importance of our amendments, which sought to achieve this. - (FR) The Commission communication lists a series of objectives and proposals reporting the need to continue the efforts undertaken in the field of inspection and supervision, to adopt new technical measures under the heading of the selectivity of fishing techniques, monitoring the application of legislation in force, etc. In its communication, however, at the same time the Commission specifies that it is not in a position to ensure that this legislation is complied with. The fact is that there is no lack of existing measures and appropriate means. The Commission has a whole arsenal of restrictive conditions, measures and decisions (at both international and Community level) already in force in the fisheries and marine environment protection sectors.	de
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank. However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side. Furthermore, the tripartite relationship of Commission, Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy, where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures, for which the Commission alone has responsibility. The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this. We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference. The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate. There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to. The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country' s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor. I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights. The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences. What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice. For this reason, we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty. In my view, that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on. If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union. This is the crux of the matter. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage. , chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. (IT) Mr President-in-Office, on listening to the various interventions, you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament' s political groups, the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency, instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference. I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this, last week in the Committee I chair, but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager.	fr
The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform: the issues at stake. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today. I am basically here to speak to you, as indicated by your agenda, on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform. This reform must involve all the actors in European construction, with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner, the Council ministers and national MPs. It must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European construction. This morning, in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi, many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions. Yet it is not just a question of who does what, as one of you said very clearly and forcefully. Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do. We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future, particularly with the countries which will be joining us. We too are concerned about this lack of democracy, and the Commission has therefore decided to launch the 'Dialogue on Europe' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people. This initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference. During the IGC I will have the honour of representing the Commission together with Mr Prodi and of working closely with your two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos. All the Commissioners have undertaken to use some of their time when they go to any country or region, and not just their own, which in my case happens three or four times a month, to engage in direct dialogue with the public, and not just with the √©lite or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course. We also plan to establish direct contacts in universities, schools and factories, to meet the people, answer their questions and listen to them. In this way we will play our part, as will you, in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do. We hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament. We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work. We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organisations, socio-professional organisations and the media. Opinion multipliers, political groups and parties, MEPs and national MPs, elected representatives, as I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved.	fr
I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve. But we shall have a decision very soon. (The Minutes were adopted) Reforming the Commission The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission. I shall give the floor straight away to the President, Mr Romano Prodi. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission. I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July: the outgoing Commission had been in crisis, I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination. The climax of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the Commission, to reform it thoroughly, completely revolutionising the Commission' s way of working. Today, that commitment has been fully discharged: you have the reform here, before you, in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission. I would like to emphasise that, on that occasion too, the Commission voted unanimously, with one voice. Briefly, these are the main points of the reform. One: definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources. This is at the heart of the system, and it is this, the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources, which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board. In order to do this, we have created a completely new policy-planning mechanism, a system which will allow the College to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these, to assign well-defined objectives to the Directorates-General and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control, which is of fundamental importance. In this context, activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives, actions and resources. The second point is human resources. It is the central part of our reform. Our staff are the Commission' s best asset, its richest resource. They are extremely highly qualified, of a calibre which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used. This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission, and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work. However, at the same time, I have found that morale amongst the Commission' s staff is very low. Previously, there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution, but now staff are frequently demoralised by the unceasing criticism. All this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform. Recruitment, career development, mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria: there will be greater emphasis on individual service, credible and, above all, verifiable performance appraisal systems, lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility. These are the areas in which changes will be made. The third point, which was also rather a sensitive, key issue in the recent crisis, is financial management.	de
"Mr President, being the last to speak gives me the privilege, Commissioner, of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total, and, I believe, justified, confidence in you at the helm of this boat. But we all want to be oarsmen on it. We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you. I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform. The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories. Firstly, there is the concern that some have expressed, in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, President of the Committee on Economic Affairs, of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty. I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed. Secondly, we have the issue of companies' legal certainty. It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty. We all agree on this. But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimising the nature of the internal market. On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said. There have only been nine rejections. But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer. How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project, in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante, changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules! This is therefore an aspect to be considered. Thirdly, we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law. In this respect, the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon. I believe that biodiversity is good, as is cultural diversity, but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market, that is to say, competition law. Here improvements should be made. Only in certain countries, Germany for example, is there specialised jurisdiction. Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore, but we must also explore others. What we cannot do, Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way, and give ammunition, to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good, of the rich, and not of the citizen, or the small and medium business, which, in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements, very late, with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call ""le parcours du combatant"", that is to say, after Lord knows how many years, when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement, a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment."	fr
I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February. Can you tell us your position on this subject? Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe. At long last, the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative. The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent. However, if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times, the Treaty must include a flexibility clause. Mr Solana can play an important role in this. He is not stupid. Certainly not! He is a driven man, a competent man. But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence. In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit. One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep, Mr President. From a democratic point of view, I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable. This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is, of course, not a democratically elected politician, but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament. His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten, as has been illustrated again today, in fact. It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold. This too is unacceptable in my view. Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power. Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself. Mr President, peace is the European Union' s very raison d' √™tre. I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly. We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance. But look at us now! We are observing the misery in Chechnya in a position of powerlessness, and regard the wars in Africa with indifference, despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries, given that they are ex-colonies. Some of them are our ACP partners. The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment. In Kosovo, we stepped in with military means, having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia. We are now unable to guide the peace. This is why Europe is not credible as a Union. I do not believe, Mr Solana, that we can restore this credibility by military means. As representatives from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries, but we always needed to fight those who came to oppress us. We are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term. This is not because we are against European defence, but European defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound, democratically-based decision process in respect of foreign affairs.	fr
"Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see. That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform. If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a ""hand-up"". I urge the House to support these changes. Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work. The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions. Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment. These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines. Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life. Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland. In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best. Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that. However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy. Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it. The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South. Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States. If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities. Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation."	de
In view of all this, we also believe the time has come to demand a redoubled effort by the Commission and the Member States, on behalf of those who are now drowning in Mozambique. The EUR 1 million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the Mozambican Government at 65 million dollars. The time has also come to demand greater efficiency. We hope that the debate at the beginning of this afternoon, the Commissioner' s knowledge of the situation in Mozambique and the visit by Mr Nielson will lead to a major effort being made by all sides to help Mozambique. Mr President, the situation in Mozambique is of the greatest urgency. Each day, each hour of delay costs many lives. There are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims. The water levels continue to rise. Starvation and epidemics seem inevitable. It is as if the whole world is looking on, helplessly. The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness. I must admit that I have my doubts about this. Commissioner Nielson is flying out today. In European terms, this may be swift action, but given the emergency in Mozambique, this is probably very late. Unlike a number of Member States, the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far. What options does the Commission have, to offer effective help fast? What could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of? Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far? Why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner? The international community could also help Mozambique in an act of generosity by cancelling its debts, not only because the country has adopted a relatively sound policy, but especially because the extent of human suffering makes this absolutely essential. Mr President, all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting Mozambique. There are thousands and thousands of displaced persons, a large number of dead, a lack of food and drinking water, and homes and crops have been destroyed. And this is happening in a country which, because it is one of the poorest in the world, does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary. It is therefore vital for the EU and its Member States to intervene in a way which will enable us to provide this country and its people with rapid and exceptional help. We know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation, representatives of the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Nielson left today for Mozambique. We are pleased about this development, but what is more crucial than their presence is that they should guarantee that a short and medium-term action plan will be adopted and implemented immediately. This should be done in conjunction with the Mozambican government and this plan must be able to secure the aid that the situation requires. Furthermore, it was precisely for this reason, and also because I am convinced that what we really need now is urgent and exceptional action, that I spoke today to Commissioner Nielson - just before he left - in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. I asked him to join us, as soon as he returns, to inform us about how the situation is developing and particularly about the emergency measures which the EU has already taken, and those which we are going to take.	de
Pensioners will, in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal. Indeed, whilst the young are penniless, the elderly have accumulated money and, since they are keen to turn it to good advantage, harbour great hopes for this directive. If national governments had in their hearts - as the European Union has in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earned during the course of a working life, the pensions time bomb would already have been defused. You too, in your role, Commissioner Bolkestein, have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and of pensioners, a future that I hope will improve once we have finalised this directive, by which I mean very soon, as has been proposed by Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi. . (NL) Mr President, could I first of all express my heartfelt thanks to rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has principal authority, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Brian Crowley and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, whom I would like to thank for their thorough and important work on the refinement and extension of the proposals. Since the approval of Directive 85/611, the investment funds sector has undergone lengthy development and it is now important to modernise the rules. The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors, which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro. Since the average European family puts its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and I would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk-spreading are concerned. The two proposals form a coherent whole. The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities' (UCITS) can invest. As already remarked in this session, UCITS are key players within the modern capital markets. Their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets, in which the principle of risk-spreading is taken into consideration, protected by appropriate supervision. Since diverse types of investment are permitted, private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques. The second proposal expands the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the EU capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector. By allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross-border basis, these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the Treaty of Rome, which they have been denied for all these years. The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas. The Commission will adopt Amendments Nos - and I am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 for the first proposal, and 23, 28 and 32 for the second proposal, since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements.	fr
This is the great challenge, the great importance of Lisbon. I just want to dwell on one or two key aspects that will help us realise that goal of turning rhetoric into reality. Firstly, there is the commitment to having genuine benchmarks, a genuine process of peer review, to the setting of targets, of genuine targets that we can achieve, to governments agreeing to embark upon what is quite a brave process of saying: 'yes, we will allow ourselves to be marked against each other, we will allow ourselves to be marked against the rest of the world' . That really is a brave decision, because some Member States will clearly find themselves towards the bottom of the league table, which is something nobody likes. But this is important if we are to have a genuine achievable outcome from this Lisbon Summit rather than perhaps setting off down another road - a road which I know Prime Minister Gut√≠errez does not want to embark on, because he actually wants to see something achieved in the process of the Lisbon Summit. There are other areas that we must look at. One of these is the challenge of creating an e-Europe which involves all its citizens and does not leave anybody on the wayside. Another is the process of actually having a genuine single market - which we still do not yet have - and skills training that will be the key to delivering that innovative and knowledge-driven society. There are tough choices, but once again in the gallery here tonight, I would like those people listening to this debate to take away with them the belief that we are going to actually have a society based on full employment, that the road to Lisbon will be the end of our journey, and that some concrete results will actually come out of it. I welcome the new strategic goal of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive area. Who could challenge such an ambition? I have to say, however, that dynamism and entrepreneurship as well as social cohesion are a very ambitious target, not to mention the creative tension between those two objectives. I hope that we will achieve them, but I sound a warning note. I note another ambitious objective of playing a proactive role in organising cyberspace. I cannot help thinking this is more a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted! I welcome the emphasis on bolstering research and development in Europe, on developing content industries and on speeding up broad-band networks with all that is involved as part of working towards a knowledge society. Actually, I would prefer to call it an information economy because it is the economy aspect which is the most important. We live in the time of IDEA - the Internet digital electronic age. That sums up what we are trying to achieve on the e-side, the electronic side, of life. But I welcome the fact that this summit is aiming also at a wider emphasis on reforms of our economies in Europe to improve competitiveness and innovation.	el
If the FIPOL ceiling is insufficient, and it has clearly been underestimated, then it must be raised. Our resolution calls for this. If the increase is not enough then the polluter should pay the balance. It would be particularly unfair to have an oil company, whose profits this year amount to FRF 10 billion, refusing to give 100% compensation to its own victims, the great majority of whom are small businesses and employees. Commissioner, the stricken people await tangible expressions of solidarity at European level. Our resolution calls upon the Commission to take the necessary steps to assist in repairing the damage caused in the fishing industry affected by the consequences of the disaster. Maritime Europe and the CFP must today demonstrate that, in addition to imposing constraints on fishermen, it is not unfamiliar with the concept of solidarity. The European Union must also participate in the restoration of the wetland and coastal environments affected, whose biological value is important to the Union as a whole. Mr Fischler has just told us that he would welcome France' s requests. I am pleased to hear it. We must act as a catalyst in this crucial issue of maritime pollution. Twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster laxness and irresponsibility still reign supreme in Europe in matters of maritime safety, resulting in yet more oil slicks. This time, we must not let inertia win the day. A basis for maritime safety must be drawn up speedily, respecting the principle of subsidiarity, and we must at long last put an end to this downward spiral of widespread irresponsibility. Mr President, the economy of the western Atlantic coastline has been devastated, polluted by oil from the Erika. Fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, workers in the tourist industry, and local and regional authorities are growing impatient while waiting for aid and for someone to deal with the time-bomb which the apparently still leaking wreck represents. Having withdrawn the budget line for 'natural disasters affecting Member States' with such poor timing, Europe has a duty to respond, firstly in the name of solidarity but also because it shares responsibility in this umpteenth oil slick disaster. European citizens find it hard to understand why Europe accepts conditions which the Americans refuse and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has until now blocked any measures to do with maritime safety. Europe must pass legislation at the earliest possible opportunity and investigate the matter of this wreck thoroughly, but, in the meantime, the Commission must, as a matter of urgency, harness European funds to aid the businesses affected in order to deal with the wreck, clean up the coastline, increase the capacity of waste storage facilities, ensure that waste is processed or recycled, and set up a research programme into the recovery of oil spilt at sea. Finally, the Commission must reintroduce an appropriate budget line for 'natural disasters involving Member States' , and make the regions affected eligible for Structural Funds. What is the Commission' s view of these proposals? What decisions has the Commission already taken and what decisions does it plan to take?	fr
Although the European Parliament supports this initiative, our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of INTERREG II. However, we are aware that we must not delay this third version further, since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway. The success of INTERREG is clear and that is the opinion of the local, regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects. The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together, of innovation, of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each other. There are many interesting questions relating to it, the monitoring centre, the principle of concentration etc. However, I would like to concentrate on the management bodies. We must create joint, interregional and transnational management bodies, in which all local and regional authorities, as well as economic and social operators, play an active role. There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border. We must create a cross-border culture, and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation, imaginatively overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each Member State, in each region and each municipality. A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication. During debates in committee, we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instruments, such as MEDA, TACIS or PHARE. This Parliament' s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties, making proposals capable of solving them to the Commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes. Mr President, my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative, in Ireland in particular, has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area. It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage. Even in Member States and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos, in situations where there are inadequate facilities, where schooling is very poor, where the physical infrastructure is under-developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife. It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and their families. The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland, as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries. It was quite slow in getting off the ground there, but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes. It is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative. It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme. I should like to make one further point before I conclude: we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious URBAN development policy. This, unfortunately, is not the case in Ireland. I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market. The development partnerships are a very clever idea, even though they are experimental. I have two major concerns, however, about the development partnerships. They should be accessible to smaller groups, accessible for them to be able to devise, implement and monitor the programmes. We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme.	fi
We talked about the importance of the Commission developing a series of headline goals for non-military actions related to crises and, if I may say so, if ever there was a case where that is relevant, it is the disaster which has overwhelmed Mozambique. Let me turn to the assistance provided so far. Last week ECHO decided to allocate EUR 1 million for flood relief, of which 600 000 will be dispersed through the Spanish Red Cross and 150 000 through MSF Luxembourg, for operations in Mozambique and EUR 250 000 to Botswana through the German Red Cross. These NGOs will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care, water and sanitation. ECHO is currently preparing a second decision for a further EUR 2 million This decision will be implemented through UNICEF, Action Contre La Faim, COSV, Nuova Frontera and Vireaid pending, of course, the reception and examination of their final proposals. These NGOs will be concentrating on the areas of water and sanitation, provision of shelter, plastic sheeting, jerry cans, blankets, those sorts of things. They will be concentrating on the reinstallation of displaced people, on the further prevention of outbreaks of malaria, cholera and other communicable diseases, on the provision of supplementary food to malnourished and children at risk, on the provision of seeds and tools, on food security, on the rehabilitation of essential animal health structures and on the training of village livestock promoters. A third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of Commissioner Nielson. The Commission is also preparing a medium-term Community response combining NGO co-financing with European Development Fund operations to help Mozambique to respond to the crisis situation in re-establishing the rapid pace of growth that Mozambique had worked so hard to achieve. It is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to re-construction within a three to four years time horizon. At times like this we are all aware of how much more we need to do to prevent disasters and to deal expeditiously with the disasters that we are not able to prevent. I am not sure that I can add very much at this stage to the analysis of what went wrong and what we can do better but obviously we must learn any lessons that are required from this terrible calamity. I repeat, Commissioner Nielson will be happy to report to Parliament when he returns from Mozambique and the scene of the disaster. Mr President, Commissioner, Mozambique is a young African country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy. The credit for Mozambique' s success story must be shared equally by its government, by the opposition, but above all, by the people of Mozambique. There is a risk, however, that all the effort that has been made in recent years, after all the problems with the peace agreements, with which we are all familiar, will have been wasted as a result of the natural forces that have been unleashed on Mozambique over the last few weeks. The current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying, as the Commissioner has already said: around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees, waiting for a helicopter to come and save them. There have already been hundreds of deaths. The EU and some of its Member States, including my own, have provided emergency financial aid, perhaps a little later than they should have, but they have done so, as have the United States and various countries in the region, particularly South Africa. It is now obvious that the main priority is for rescue helicopters, followed immediately by food aid and other emergency humanitarian aid. Although these floods began three weeks ago, the whole world has finally begun to wake up to the dire straits Mozambique currently finds itself in: there are thousands of people whose lives are hanging by a thread and who will soon die unless we arrange transport, particularly air transport, to get them out of the situation they are in.	fi
The Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations. I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues. I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate. First of all, regarding the observations made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additives in the Additives Directive 70/524, and not in the Novel Feed Directive. This is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives. The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998. But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing. It is before Parliament for second reading. It is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90/220 and in particular, Article 11. Reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies. Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this. There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue. First of all, this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993, so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers. Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product. I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives. Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base, whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152. I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health. This is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the European Court of Justice, which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation. The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this. As an overall comment to the suggested amendments here, particularly in relation to the legal base issue, it would be inappropriate, in my opinion, to change the legal base to Article 152 in these circumstances, as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the Court. A number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling.	fr
Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment. European agriculture would not, for example, be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread. As a result, agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU, with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs. I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is a precious raw material. Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal. It should, therefore, not surprise us that water is the cause of wars. The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs. General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation. Europe is therefore facing an arduous task; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation. I have to admit that in Flanders, where I come from, we still have a long way to go too. We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter. Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way. The common position is in this respect a farce, a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements. The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years. By then, my children will be older than I am now. You have to admit: this is a joke. Tomorrow, we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children. Either we opt for the amendments of my group, of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment. I would like to finish off with this observation. In the past couple of months, we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium. What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers. In our own country, this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations. They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament' s more drastic positioning. I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware. Ladies and gentlemen, fine words are no longer sufficient. We need to change tack completely. During the vote tomorrow, we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy. This can only benefit our credibility. The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.	fr
"The Commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries. In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Mr President, the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union. Will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because, in the final analysis, we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the European Union? My question therefore is this: will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions? The key issue is to support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk group to find a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can. We have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia. Let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union. The situation of Turkey's relations with its neighbours will, as the honourable Member asks, be closely examined in the framework of the pre-accession strategy. As stated in Agenda 2000 - and I quote: ""Enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts"". That statement could not be much clearer. But I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results. Question No 38 by (H-0040/00):  Subject: Implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey Given that Turkey has recently been granted applicant country status, what is the Commission's view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam, given the massive displacement of the Kurdish and the other people of the region that will result? The Commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the region. We will, however, consider raising the matter with the Turkish authorities, together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey. I have a related point. It concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole. As you know, the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to Syria and to Iraq in particular. Given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many commentators that we will see an increased incidence of conflict, of so-called ""water wars"", in the coming decades, what is the Commission's view about the potential destabilisation, both in Turkey and in the wider region, that will be caused by this dam? Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well? We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member."	el
I am, however, optimistic. Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened. The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union. It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union, which will, however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned. The Commission' s former president, Jacques Delors, has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation. He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions, for the sake of clarity. The Commission' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines. Last November, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe: the onion skin model. In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility. Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party. My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand. I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions. This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about. May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament. A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly. If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality, six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants, you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales, which is a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom. Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in this House at the moment; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen. Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700, bring in 26% more population over time, and then adopt the Commission' s, I think ill-considered, proposition, that there should be a European list of candidates. What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here? It will become totally invisible! Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones.	el
Moreover, Europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries, even though it faces increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products. Since the Treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real Community tourism policy, the European Union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment. Vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in Europe especially, as far as tourist service providers are concerned, in meeting multicultural demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers. Employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious, thereby hampering its sustainable development. It is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible. As the report notes, the adoption by the Member States of tax incentives for SMEs in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour-intensive sectors and, consequently, in the tourism sector. This sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions, especially the most remote and island regions, which have undisputed assets in this area. Let us not forget that, in the most remote regions, tourism is the most important industry in terms of income. The income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community. In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it makes us more aware of other European cultures and thus helps respect for European ways of life to develop. It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed rationally in the long term, should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies, while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural, cultural, historical and environmental heritage. I should like to close by stressing the essential role which the European Union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental Europeans to discover the most far-flung destinations in Europe, namely the most remote regions. Mr President, we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance. The basic document is really no more than a Commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment. Not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 April 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old. This document stems from the previous Commission. It is undoubtedly the result of work carried out by Commissioner Papoutsis throughout his term of office and which culminated in the Luxembourg summit and his failed Philoxenia programme. I believe this is the first debate in this House with the new Commission and a new Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, who is of course listening very closely to what we are discussing. I would take this opportunity to ask him a couple of questions directly. Firstly, the governments made a commitment at the Maastricht Conference of 1992 to include a legal basis for this issue in the Treaties. This commitment was not fulfilled in the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 and is therefore outstanding. Yet there is a Council resolution from last June on tourism and employment. What expectations does the Commissioner have that the new Intergovernmental Conference which is starting will include this aspect? My second question is much more direct and perhaps more awkward. Bearing in mind the failed efforts of the last decade, as highlighted by Mr Koch, does Commissioner Liikanen believe that he can do something during his term of office to ensure that the Community dimension of tourism becomes a proper policy, given the importance that all the previous speakers have given to tourism in terms of employment?	fi
"In short, what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy? We fall back on a kind of ersatz army based on humanitarian rights, a kind of army in the service of vague ideas, of an ideal, the dangers of which have many times been shown in history. A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one' s own interests. But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system. Who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the twosome formed by London and Berlin, escorted by their respective henchmen, and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of Washington, seeing themselves at best as bit-part players. Mr Solana, you yourself are a perfect illustration of this, as it were, structural complicity, passing smoothly from NATO to the CFSP as if they were one and the same. Of course, in reality, they are the same thing. It is still the old imperial service. It is not without some amusement that we have seen you, in your pathetic rivalry with Mr Patten, present this delightful and most charming argument: one day you told a German newspaper, ""I am the one that the Americans phone up"" . You might have added, Mr Solana, 'to give me their instructions' , because that is what we see, in fact. In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it. Yes, Jean-Claude Martinez was indeed right to interrupt you, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. In every case, it is follow-my-leader syndrome. Do you think I am going over the top? Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience. Echelon is one of many examples of this, giving an image of Europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here. The experts speak of a cultural problem, I think they might be right! On behalf of the combined European right, I must say to you, Mr Solana, as High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, we do not have confidence in you. You say that you are against war, but as Secretary-General of NATO you started a war. A war of aggression, slavishly carrying out American military policy, in a sphere that was not that of the North Atlantic Treaty, against a state that had never been a member, that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non-interference as well as those governing the declaration of war. Today, even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for. We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern, that is the least one can say. First of all, in your view, does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world? Secondly, if you do recognise this right, then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on? I can already hear your reply: humanitarian standards. In Kosovo, it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia. When the US killed 2 000 people in Panama, it was not to impose their politics, it was to combat drug trafficking. When they landed in Somalia, before having to withdraw in disarray, it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route, it was to restore hope."	fi
The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those. Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the report she has carried out, and also the Commission - why not? - because this report, this position, generally improves on the texts in force. Furthermore, it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent. I would also like to congratulate the services of the Commission, since the evaluation, control and monitoring of the LIFE programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects. However, I would like to insist on certain points. Firstly, its continuity, which, in principle, I am not questioning. Secondly, the financial contributions. Sadly, only 7.2% of the projects requested receive funds. Of the EUR 1 919 million requested, only EUR 784 million have been granted. Now the financial statement shows only EUR 613 million to cover more countries and competences. Parliament has proposed EUR 850 million, but the document repeats the initial proposal of EUR 613 million. Commissioner, our environmental commitments are increasing in all areas, while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicated to the environment is decreasing. Is this not a contradiction? Let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves? Why do we all go on about the environment and are then not prepared to pay for it amongst all of us, but rather expect the usual people, the ones who live there all year, to pay for it and maintain it? Commissioner, we must be consistent. The cost of maintaining the environment, which we all enjoy, must be met by all of us, and the LIFE programme is the only financial instrument aimed exclusively at the environment and whose projects have generally been effective. Mr President, LIFE has been the principal instrument available to the Community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy, both within the Community and in the surrounding third countries. On the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years, an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument. The funding of activities for the implementation, adaptation and development of Community policy in the environment sector and the incorporation of the environment in other policies, particularly ones that contribute towards sustainable development, are central elements of the regulation we are to vote upon. An important element of LIFE-Nature, which mainly concerns the realisation of the Natura 2000 network, is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities, so as to avoid the fragmentation of biotopes and to offer better protection of biodiversity. In the second, LIFE-Environment strand, which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium-sized enterprises and local government agencies, the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed. As regards the financing package for the implementation of LIFE over the next five years, I wholeheartedly support the increase from EUR 613 million to EUR 850 million proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann.	el
"Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all, but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations. Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy. In practice that means the following for the postal services: firstly, priority must be given to employment. I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right. Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services. Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk. Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union. So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent. Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days. On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying. We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile. In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset. Mr President, we are currently in the first phase of transposition of Directive 97/67/CE on postal services and I am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered. During Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, my colleague V√©ronique Mathieu asked for an undertaking ""that any new proposals, once these are known, should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted."" What has become of it? Do we have the results of this impact study? As you know, we members of the EDD Group, are in favour, along with others, of rural life, maintaining employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service. Most assuredly I would like to be able to say that the examples I observe every day in my own country and in my own region, a very rural one, convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation. Unfortunately, this is not the case and currently, by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35-hour law, which is purely French, but also by changing the working time criteria, such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400, as previously, in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed. This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service. I have here the local paper for my municipality, which reads, ""The manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 January 2000"" - you can see how topical this is - ""the last collection will take place at 3.45 p.m. instead of at 4.30 p.m. as at present."""	de
"I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda, and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the Treaties. We feel that at present the central issues about convening an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda. They are also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulating proposals for new issues to be covered, and more important than the controversy over the extent of Parliament' s participation in it. We feel that these issues result from the IGC' s appropriateness and its objectives, as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there. We have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged. This relates in particular to the intended agenda, particularly as regards the Amsterdam leftovers, which suggests that unacceptable inner cabinets will be created in the future. This also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars, which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union. These are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us. - The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report. The text is overambitious, and Britain' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the ""Amsterdam left-overs"" in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these. There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions. Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation. The key factor in this text as it has been amended, is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties. In our view, this would bring with it a complex legislative burden, and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are. Our priorities (i.e. the ""left-overs"" ) must be: the number and responsibilities of Commissioners weighting of votes in the Council extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe (but not Treaty change, defence matters, border controls or taxation), and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended Beyond this, we have concerns that the ""flexibility"" or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present. The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation. - (SV) In order to be able to influence developments, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference than emerges from the present resolution, which displays far too much disappointment and negativity about the decision which the European Council made in Helsinki in December 1999."	fr
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy, which I hope it will be able to meet because, for certain, many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale. Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices. Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element, and, particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that. Mr President, in the limited time I have, I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here, in particular by Mr Jonckheer, who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid. I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82, especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration. As a Member for the Basque Country, I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market. I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general, and Mr Monti, in particular, for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid. Our discrepancy stems from the fact that the Commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our Basque fiscal rules the same nature, foundation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union, and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who, by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law, are subject to those rules. Mr President, Commissioner, competition is exactly what we need. We need competition if there is the least unemployment, for a smooth-running healthcare system, for social justice, for high social standards, and, of course, we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products, equal market access conditions for all enterprises, and environmentally-friendly products. In other words, we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics. I often have the impression, unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded, that very often the reverse is the case; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics. I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this. But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand. I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Gr√∂nitz steelworks in Brandenburg, although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained. But these are competitive jobs, for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany. Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too. It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve. If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics. Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people' s social welfare and boost purchasing power. To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply. Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today.	fi
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough. Secondly, we must also clarify our own auditing roles. The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action. It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation. We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF' s job. Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents. Obstinate as I am, I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet. Otherwise, we shall not get anywhere in this fight. Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report. I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch, now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so. Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this. I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments. I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic. I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments. I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pom√©s Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective. Mr President, one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is, to my mind, the rapporteur' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration. A very important proposal indeed. I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan, because she wants to scrap it altogether. I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale. On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes. I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock, but I happen to know Mr Kinnock. He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary. In my opinion, such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary. Finally, the issue of officials. Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder' s view. I do agree that the section on officials has, in fact, been completed totally inadequately. First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised. Secondly, all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement.	fr
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region. We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard. SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy. It focuses on non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted. Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings. We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business, saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical. It is something that we can all support. I have to say, like motherhood, although we all support it, sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving. We could do rather more, considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports. We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see. We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change. If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do. I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal, since she has contributed, in collaboration with the other Members, to the achievement of a very reasonable final result, which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and, of course, on what, from a budgetary point of view, the Council had initially accepted. As Mrs Ahern has explained very well, the budgets of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme, are basically symbolic budgets, since the burden is shouldered by the countries, the States of the Union, the regions or even, in some cases, the local authorities. However, despite the fact that the volume is relatively small, it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action, which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments. This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources, greater safety in our energy supplies and, in the case of SAVE, to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy, thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set. Furthermore, behind these programmes, that is to say, the SAVE programme, which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings, and the Altener programme, which concerns renewable energy, there lies an extremely important technological challenge, which, from an economic point of view, may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole.	fr
"Moreover, this Parliament has had a woman president since the 1999 elections. I shall conclude by repeating the conclusions of the conference organised by the Commission in April 1999 entitled ""Women and men in power"" . Equality between men and women is not a problem that affects women alone, but one that affects our entire society! - Some progress has been made recently in increasing the number of women present in decision-making bodies around the Union. In our own Institution, 30% of elected representatives are now women, including the President of the European Parliament itself. Finland too has just elected a female President. On average, one quarter of Member State governments are composed of women and a little over one fifth of their parliaments. This is still far from satisfactory, especially given that the figures vary enormously between Member States where the Nordic countries experience a much higher female representation in positions of responsibility and decision making. This situation has more to do with attitude and respect for the quality and abilities of women' s contributions to society than fixed quotas. My Group does not favour the use of quotas in general since, in the long run, they can be counterproductive and even undermine the cause they aim to support. Nevertheless, we recognise that the experience in all Member Sates is not the same and some recourse to such measures may be justified, as a temporary remedy, to rebalance female representation where women are grossly under-represented. We were able to support the resolution on women in decision making, adopted with a view to commemorating International Women' s Day on 8 March, which has incorporated ten Liberal Group amendments and softened the reference to quotas in line with the approach outlined above. - (FR) Women suffer increasingly from inequality since they are the victims of the sexist discrimination which can take an overt form (violence, rape, sexual harassment, domestic violence, etc.) but also a more insidious one. This oppression is based upon a sexual and social division of labour which values men' s work more than women' s. Wages are not equal, women' s work is still perceived as 'stop-gap' work and, more generally, female employees do not have access to the same positions of responsibility as men. What is more, women bear the main responsibility for family matters. Women must be entitled to full time employment on an equal footing with men. Mandatory legislation must be adopted in order to encourage equality in the workplace. States must develop a public service offering childcare for working mothers. Finally, in order to enable everyone, men and women, to become involved in public life, working hours must be drastically reduced. We need real equality between men and women in political, economic and social life. We are opposed to the idea that the biological differences between men and women should give rise to two different world views and two different value systems. Women have the right to be involved in the decision-making process as 'individuals' and not as token females. - I, together with my colleagues in the British Conservative delegation, am totally committed to the need to have more women playing a full and active part in public life. We share in all expressions of regret that there remains inequality and gender discrimination and especially under-representation of women in politics. However, we are not convinced that one form of discrimination should be countered with another form of discrimination, namely the introduction of quotas to guarantee women elected places. I feel this especially keenly as only on Tuesday evening of this week my 27-year-old daughter, Caroline, was selected as the prospective Conservative candidate for the Southampton Itchen constituency in the United Kingdom. She achieved this position totally on her own merit and in open competition against all-comers. We should not adopt a position that in any way detracts from the position of the increasing number of women who are demonstrating that without fear or favour they can earn their place in public life. For this reason members of my delegation have supported much of the resolution but we registered our opposition to those calls for positive discrimination in favour of women, which we think is the wrong way to make progress, is itself demeaning to women and distorts the democratic process and we have therefore abstained in the final vote."	fi
"I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this. But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand. I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Gr√∂nitz steelworks in Brandenburg, although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained. But these are competitive jobs, for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany. Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too. It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve. If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics. Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people' s social welfare and boost purchasing power. To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply. Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today. I would like to quote verbatim from the report: ""State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland. Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."" I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures. I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation. I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus. This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe. Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper. I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000. I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace. No other Member State is at such a disadvantage. Mr President, the monopolies' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe. The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies' ban to be unsatisfactory, something I would wholeheartedly agree with. But opinion differs as to the solution. The Commission' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation. In other words, we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse. Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system. I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law."	de
Hence, it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted. Finally, I would like to reiterate that Mr Di Pietro has, in my opinion, delivered sterling work by submitting a report which, within the limitations, offers all possible guarantees for safeguarding individual human rights and fundamental freedoms. If, however, we would like to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation. Mr President, my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs. The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government. The present proposal is complex, because it deals with agreements between Member States but has far-reaching consequences for the citizen-government relationship. It is precisely in the field of legal protection that the Council' s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired. In the words of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro, the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings. Thanks to the agreement, it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests, whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different Member States. The chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court. Additional measures are hence required, such as the obligation on the part of criminal investigators to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used. The fact that the Council' s proposal rides roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my Group. There are certainly no restrictions in its scope. As such, the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime. In fact, it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law. It is, therefore, conceivable that the European Union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will vanish in the dust. Mr President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters that we are examining today contains the minimum requirements for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies concerned. It pertains, among other things, to notifications, information exchanges, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of property, testimonies via video conferences, investigative activities and 'undercover' activities, and the interception of telephone calls. This is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached, and it should immediately be said that if any amendments, such as Amendments Nos 32 or 81, or the revised Amendments Nos 70 or 71, were to be passed, the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped, and we would vote against it. I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments. The fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this Parliament.	fr
The cost of Internet access, the sidelining of entire sectors of society (the young unemployed, housewives, the elderly) and the shortcomings in education and vocational training are serious obstacles to an information society meant to benefit everyone. The second relates to the individuals working in this sector; given the flexibility that is a feature of the sector, organisational structures must be set up for the employees, together with guarantees of their rights, in relation to social security, pensions or the necessary job-security provisions. My third and last point relates to the question of public service and improving the democratic systems to develop procedures... (The President cut the speaker off) Mr President, Commissioner, e-Europe is a really important programme for everyone en route from the industrial society to the information society. I would therefore like to congratulate the Portuguese presidency on its decision to make this issue the focus of the special summit. I should like to congratulate the Commission on its proposal and the rapporteur on her report and I should like to explain why I have praised you and why I should like to take you all at your word. The focal point of the report and the prime objective of the Commission' s proposal make it clear that we need to achieve equal opportunities for, and equal participation of, all citizens in the information society. According to the text, e-Europe should, first and foremost, show each citizen, each household, each school, each company and each administration the way to the digital age and the Internet. This goal, in my view, does not justify the concerns raised here about a possible division in society between the haves and have-nots as far as access to information is concerned. I have highlighted this objective because I believe that it illustrates to particularly good effect how the citizens stand to benefit from European Union intervention in the information society, but, of course, only if we keep our word and fulfil the promises which we have made them. If we really do ensure by the end of 2002 that all schools - and this is in the programme - have high-speed access to the Internet and to multimedia resources in the classroom, if we really do ensure that by 2003 every citizen, rich or poor, has comprehensively guaranteed access to our health system and if we really do promptly take the action urgently needed in order to promote our SMEs, i.e. hedge the joint risks for venture capital in the Community. That is a task for the Council, Parliament and the Commission. I wish us all a great deal of success in the interests of our citizens. Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the successful work that has been done in so short a period of time. An information society for all is certainly an area of focus for the Commissioner in this process. It is important, and I thank her for it. Agreement should be reached at Lisbon on the principles of the sustainable funding of social security on account of this notion. We also have to reach agreement with management and labour, for example, on the subject of remote working and vocational training, if what we are talking about is an information society for all. It will not be so if the basic rights of employees are not safeguarded. There is a threat that, because of the Internet, services will become self-services, and that again is a major employment issue. Another matter is that we have been deregulating the telecommunications industry for around ten years, and now, with these massive Internet players merging there is a fear that they will once again start regulating the market. This, I think, should be stopped. It cannot be allowed to happen and I expect the Commission to sit up and listen and take the necessary action. Thirdly, the quoted share value for a certain Internet company rose by a sudden 4 000% in one month, and this came about merely because unsubstantiated information was given about it for the stock market. With many companies in the same position, or almost the same position, there is going to be a bubble effect in the industry, and when the crash comes I hope the taxpayer will not be footing the bill. Has the Commissioner a remedy in mind for if and when the air balloon companies in this sector burst so that the taxpayer does not have to pay out, as is the case with crises in the banks, for example?	fi
He acknowledged that 15 million Europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion. What is more, the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority. Yet, all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies. The Commission' s decision to allow the ABB-Alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point. The new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings. This global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs. In my region of the UK in particular the employment consequences of this merger have been severe as a result of ABB-Alsthom having announced that it was cutting 270 jobs in Britain with 95 jobs being lost in Stafford and 112 in Rugby. The company' s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying. It is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee. Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation, adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States. I do not think it is simply a matter of a Community charter. EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer. The Commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences. We need more joined-up policy making on these issues. What we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation. This is the only way of respecting Article 127 of the Treaty. I welcome the statement made by Commissioner Liikanen, but I also look for the support of this Parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have passed on workers' rights is implemented rigorously and to ensure that impact assessments on the workforce for proposed mergers are undertaken as a matter of course. I have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure. That concludes the debate. The vote will be taken later this evening. The sitting was suspended at 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.05 p.m. TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance. Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain) The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: B5-0149/2000 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on outbreaks of racism and xenophobia in the El Ejido area in Spain; B5-0159/2000 by Mr Gas√≤liba i B√∂hm and Mr S√°nchez Garc√≠a, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain); B5-0162/2000 by Mrs D√≠ez Gonz√°lez and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the outbursts of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain); B5-0169/2000 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on outbursts of xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain); B5-0175/2000 by Mr Bautista Ojeda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on xenophobia-related incidents in El Ejido (Spain). Mr President, I am reassured by the fact that the first three speakers in this debate are intimate with this situation given our African origin. I must firstly congratulate the groups in this House on the high degree of consensus achieved in the motion for a resolution. I am aware of the efforts made by Members to avoid using an issue such as this for electoral purposes. Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone. We should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner. These events, which are unfortunately overshadowing the political decisions in this area, confirm without doubt that the development of the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the EC Treaty must be an urgent priority. Today' s problems cannot be solved in five years. They will take a long time, as we are finding out. The legislation of the Member States must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in Tampere, as paragraph 7 of the motion states.	fi
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats. Everything else is wishful thinking. That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment. We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra. The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny. This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States. No soldier can, of course, be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament. It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army. It will be a force comprised of various national units. What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment. However, there is, of course, also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament. As someone who both speaks and listens, we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. Finally, I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion. Yesterday, a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister. He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much. Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table. We share your delight, as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired. There is one thing I shall again finally emphasise: that the purpose of all this is, of course, that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all. That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries. Mr President, Mr Solana, we are all behaving like children. You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers. It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004, 2005, 2006. But what about Kosovo in the year 2000? You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles. I have received an e-mail from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pristina at the moment. He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina. He treated Roma, Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo. A man with three children and he was murdered. We need policemen in Kosovo right now! We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice.	fr
Instead, there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily. We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and, especially, change our practice. At the moment, Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used. Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions! Mr President, we all want to do something about combating European fraud. But the question is now: is the European Union doing anything about it as well? The answer to this is that we know very little about this. The Tampere Summit was about combating crime. Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but, in reality, we have made little progress. There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States, as was stated before, have not ratified the treaty texts submitted. So a great deal has to be done in this area. And what exactly should be done? Two things, and Mrs Theato' s report clearly spells these out. Firstly, the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union. So, unification in this small area. Secondly, we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor' s Office with two tasks, firstly to assist the national public prosecutors, helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and, secondly, to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision. The European Public Prosecutor' s Office is nothing to be afraid of. I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on. It is, in fact, something very positive. Just like Europol. Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces. This is exactly the task which a small, limited, European Public Prosecutor' s Office should carry out, not just at the criminal investigation stage, but also at the prosecution stage. Parliament supports this. The Committee of Wise Men supports this. I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same. Mr President, I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris. I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue. Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation. The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK. The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about. Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget. But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists, with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity. We need a public debate on this. We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed. The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed.	de
Mr D√©sir, I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution. If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled, it will be included. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m. (The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m.) Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting Mr President, I simply wanted to pass on some news. There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid. Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died. On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts. Thank you, Mrs Fraga Est√©vez. We had heard about this regrettable incident. Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish. (The Minutes were approved) Resumption of the session I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000. Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy. Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans. Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least. I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims' families. Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment. Agenda The next item is the order of business. Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government. If you decide to add this debate to the agenda, it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission. Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal? Madam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents, and, since I publicly criticised the presidency in January, I would like to take this opportunity to say, both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we now find the presidency' s statements on this issue to be appropriate, and we agree on their basis, their importance and their form. Madam President, it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure. This debate is topical, exceptionally important and urgent. We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it. (Applause) Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal?	de
"Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament' s original position on the issue of comitology. Let us remember what is at stake here. Parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new Council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement. Firstly, the whole system is obscure. It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees. Here is a real step forward, in the new system that has been agreed. We are to know who is on each committee. We are to know when they meet. We are to get the agendas. We are to get the documents that are sent to them. The whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex. So that is at least a step forward. Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission. We adopt legislation in the European Union. We expect the Commission to implement it. And then we have a system designed to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the ""contre-filet"" system, under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned. Here too there is at least some progress. The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States represented in the Council. That is a more reasonable system. That, too, is a step forward. But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied. The first criticism is of the system whereby the Commission is monitored, scrutinised, controlled if you like, only by a committee appointed by Member States or the Council not by Parliament. The legislative authority, Council and Parliament, should be equal. We confer implementing powers on the Commission, but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure. Parliament has no equivalent power. True, we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system. We are to receive all the draft implementing measures forwarded to a committee at the same time as it is sent to the committee. We will have the chance to scrutinise, to debate, to question. But we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the Commission in the legislation. In other words, we can challenge the measure for being ultra-vires but not on its content. And in a democracy, Parliament should be able to challenge the content. Not that we do so every week."	el
This is an effective, transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe. This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us, an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions, rethink our very policies - all our policies - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number 25 or 30, and what will be the best thing to do at individual State level, at regional level and at local government level. But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself. We must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient, to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved, starting with the important issue of the involvement of women. One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital, as women' s involvement in economic life, an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe. This is a field where Europe has, nevertheless, always been in the vanguard. We therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind, and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies. We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001. It will not be a philosophical Paper, but a practical Paper, full of focused proposals. We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must have a total rethink, and we shall therefore do two things: we are, and will continue to be, fully committed to internal reform, and we shall rethink our policies in detail. I have asked all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo. The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are, what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activities, thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual countries, regions and local communities. So we shall be freeing up new resources, but - I fear, and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will, in turn, be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks: I am thinking of enlargement, the new sector of justice and home affairs, health issues and environmental matters. When that time comes, when we have used up all our resources, I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources, but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources, we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on. As for internal reform, you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one. I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform, if it does not become more efficient, if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors, starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid. Providing aid rapidly, when it is needed, saves human lives; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all. When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems.	fi
Quite the reverse, in fact. The Council' s proposal must comply with legislation of the national Member States in the field of criminal law. The wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test. Careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but, above all, by the national parliaments, is therefore of key importance. Mr Di Pietro' s proposal to omit the current Article 18 regarding intercepting telecommunications, amongst other things, is understandable, although very strict. The text of Article 18 is ambiguous: he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a Member State in another Member State without the latter' s prior authorisation. In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State. Proposed additions, such as repeated references to the ECHR, the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of Member States to implement the ECHR, add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement. I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text. The Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will, however, despite hesitation, not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation. This clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much-discussed European citizenship. On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting. Pursuant to Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union' s objective is 'to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia' . The creation of Europol represents one step towards achieving this objective. However, we must take the next step, which is to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to gradually establish a genuine European judicial area consistent with the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice. This draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application, at Member State level, of pre-existing conventions on other legal areas. The intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the Member States and in the European Convention on Human Rights. It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue.	de
Mr Seixas da Costa, I totally agree with you. The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working, namely Resolution 1244. Having said this, the EU' s responsibility, which is both yours and ours, is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region. It is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses, accidents and assassinations mentioned by Mr Alavanos. Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo? If so, does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States, as has tended to happen elsewhere, and reuniting the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania? Since the author is not present, Question No 7 lapses. Question No 8 by (H-0796/99): Subject: New INTERREG Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTERREG entitled: Promotion of urban, rural and coastal development, the Commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy. However, housing is specifically excluded. Given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest, including small cottages, and, given the need, for a variety of reasons, to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas, does not the Council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by INTERREG? Mr President, the Council and, I think, the Portuguese Presidency in particular, are extremely aware of the importance of the problems Mr Gallagher' s question raises and I would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas. I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development. This was, as you know, one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level. Through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund, the EAGGF, this Community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas, an issue you are quite right to raise. On the other hand, the European Regional Development Fund, the ERDF, also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion, by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion. In this regard, we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas. This combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today, furthermore, is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also, have developed and changed.	de
In 1992 we had 9.2% unemployment, both in Denmark and in the eleven countries of the good old EU. Between 1992 and 1998, unemployment in Denmark fell to 5.1%. In the EU, it increased to 10.9%. In Denmark, we have had combined growth of 20%, compared with 10% in the EU. If the Danish Government had acted in the same way under the present dispensation, it would have been downright illegal and unconstitutional because the budget deficit was 3.9% at that time. Now, Denmark also has an actual budget surplus because those who exchanged their redundancy notices for wage packets also began to pay tax instead of drawing benefit. I believe that the EU' s prime ministers ought to study the Danish example when they meet for their t√™te-√†-t√™te on the economy in Lisbon. We need a change to the EMU Treaty instead of a further string of fine words directed at the unemployed. My group hopes that Danish voters will decide to keep the Danish krone when they take part in the referendum on membership of EMU on 28 September of this year. Mr President-in-Office, I listened to your speech with great interest and it is obvious that in overall terms, no one here today could fail to agree with what you have said. You have made statements of intent, which correspond to the vision we all share of the problems of jobs and of Europe in general. From this point of view, we must also think about one of the objectives for the Lisbon Summit that you mentioned, namely combating the political deficit in Europe. It is precisely because I think that if we continue to do nothing but make broad statements of this kind, we will find it hard to overcome this political deficit, that I would like to ask you a few specific questions in order to try to understand what policy will be implemented under your presidency after the Lisbon Summit. My first question, which is a very direct one, is about an institutional issue which we now have the opportunity to discuss with you for the first time as President-in-Office of the European Council. This concerns the most serious political problem we have had to face in recent times - the problem of Austria. The question that I would like to ask very clearly is this: are you representing 14 EU countries here or 15? This is a perfectly sensible question because as President-in-Office of the European Union, you have worked and acted as the spokesperson for bilateral decisions between states. From this point of view, this question is perfectly sensible and requires the clearest possible answer. I think that in institutional terms, it is an extremely serious matter that we are moving towards replacing collegiate decisions, which the European Union is bound to observe under the Treaty, by means of bilateral decisions between governments. I am not talking about the causes of the Austrian issue. I am talking about the serious precedent that we might be setting if today we replace the collegiate procedure stipulated in the Treaties by means of bilateral decisions, in this case aimed at one particular country, because tomorrow we might adopt the same approach towards a different country or countries.	el
As for the lever, you have described all the appropriate mechanisms in your exhilarating proposal, which is exciting in so many respects. That simply leaves the fulcrum. The fulcrum is provided by resources. You find yourself before a House some of whose Members can still remember what I will refer to as the 'White Paper' syndrome, which is to say the remarkable initiative instigated by Jacques Delors that was torn to shreds by the 'accountants' at ECOFIN. We would not want the same misfortune to befall you now, as the programme that you have presented to us is so exhilarating that it could energise Europe and provide it with the future alluded to by Mr Goebbels. Nevertheless, you will have to have the means at your disposal, means which, I fear, you are somewhat lacking at present. It is thus up to you to create them. The straitjacket of Agenda 2000 will not provide you with the requisite means. You will thus have to encourage your colleagues to see to it that the proposals you make to us are going to be financed. Just one example - and it is one of the mechanisms central to your proposals - is that of the information and knowledge society. It is clear - and you explained this very well - that the social divide is a fundamental problem that we must eradicate. There is no need to add to this what I will call the digital divide. Indeed, to whom will you offer this information and knowledge society? To an increasingly aged or ageing population, to a population which, despite everything, is still poor, and to a population which is becoming, alas, less and less well educated. You will thus have to adopt a bottom-up approach if you do not want this knowledge society to amount to little more than the pursuit of profits by a number of successful and necessary new firms. This is not your objective. Unfortunately, there is one component missing from the mechanism that you have envisaged. I refer to the public services. The public services have played a key role throughout the entire existence of our European social model. It is true that the era of monopolies is past and that the Commission has initiated a process of liberalisation, of introducing competition into some public sectors in order to modernise them and improve their efficiency. But we cannot stop there. We must now define more clearly, within the context of competition and the information society, the principal public service roles of tomorrow as applicable to public undertakings and to private companies in this sector. What is needed, in this regard, are stronger measures, which do not yet feature in the Commission' s work programme, but to which you could give some impetus. This, it seems to me, would send out an extremely important signal. Lastly, this knowledge society hinges on research and development and I would like to applaud, at this juncture, the Commission initiative that aims to create a European research area. Mr President, the Commission and Parliament will nevertheless have need of the Council in order to secure the requisite resources to create this European research area. The framework programme will not suffice, it will have to be boosted, and its broad guidelines modified. This is a major task, but we are relying on you to see it through. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, you have spoken, Mr President, of a political deficit. I believe that the proposals you will put forward in Lisbon, which should help to merge these infamous broad economic policy guidelines, these 'Employment' guidelines, to form guidelines for the European policy on growth and employment, mark a step in the right direction. They are a tool for political decision making. And yet they incorporate institutional measures whose influence we will be able to assess in the medium term. They will bolster the role of the European Council in the decision-making process. What we are doing here has certain implications. Let us assess its impact on the set of decisions that we will take when we have to discuss the reform of the General Affairs Council. And then, underlying this decision-making process at European level, there is another crusade to be fought, and one which each of us must embark upon within our own Member States, since it is pointless laying down fine policy guidelines if the budgetary discussions that we enter into within our Member States fail to accommodate these guidelines.	fi
This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon, causing death. It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water, etc. Under the 1993 directive, not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected, exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution. What we currently propose is to relax this directive, so that we do not cull all the fish, but only the fish that are found to be diseased. For the others, well, we would have time to see what would happen, according to local circumstances. I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way. I would particularly draw my colleagues' attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of 27¬∫ has every advantage for the human race and that, consequently, there is no risk to men. What about women? Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard. There is also a risk to the environment, because we know that there is an incubation period in salmon and that, consequently, if they are eaten, they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk. There is another risk to the environment as well, because this disease is transmitted to wild fish, as we have seen. For this reason, together with my colleague, Patricia McKenna, we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the Commission. Mr Pietrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission' s proposal, in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish, but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy. Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach, but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community. This is a Community policy which will effect Ireland as well - where I am from - should similar unfortunate events occur. There are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease, fallowing periods, restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others. Before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the Norwegians, we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster. And people have spoken in the past about BSE. For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed. Had it been at that time, you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the EU a huge amount of money. So it also has to do with environmental protection. The protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health. I would like to thank Mr Hudghton for his excellent report on ISA and for broadly supporting the measures proposed by the Commission and also for the contributions from each of the speakers this evening.	de
The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies. Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking. We must ask ourselves a fundamental question: how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development? The second challenge is that of enlargement which will, of course, have a considerable impact, both in budgetary and geographical terms. These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us. Finally, in this time of natural disasters, I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds. As you know, it is up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation. Europe should not be completely absent, as the states tend to want. Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response, even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations. I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear. I also think we should ensure, or ask Member States to ensure, that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents. Mr President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form. As far as French planning experts are concerned, for example, the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country. Well, the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process. Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator. Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds. What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax, which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level. The Commission, however, though bound to issue guidelines, does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner. The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere. It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development. This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it. Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work. Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy. To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds. For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.	fr
I am in favour of this. But it can never replace support provided to the media in Yugoslavia, in Serbia, media which deserve this support. The EU makes a difference. The EU has made a difference in the past with its support. It has an obligation to do this in future and should also be given the means to do this. This is fine within the framework of the new CARA programme, but it is also particularly important that this should happen in two weeks' time, in conjunction with the Stability Pact. At the finance conference on the Stability Pact, the European Union can and must commit itself to a number of programmes. The programmes are ready, the necessity is there; let us take swift and unambiguous action. Mr President, whichever way we view the Balkans, in the light of recent atrocities or future events in terms of the Stability Pact, we always seem to come up against this horrifying character of Milosevic and his cronies, people who have a string of crimes against humanity to answer for and who should urgently be taken to the Court of Justice in The Hague. This crook, this old communist crook, is able to remain in power on account of his virtual monopoly of radio and TV and his oppression of any critical independent alternative, among other factors. Various actions have been undertaken on the part of the European Union, such as providing independent stations with equipment. But now that one station after the other is being closed down, the EU will need to act again in consultation with the affected parties. We just heard that Mr Wiersma was denied a visa to visit the opposition in Belgrade. It is most peculiar that the European Union is not really aware that we too have this tool at our disposal and that, for example, we should, in fact, deny entry to the EU to the Serbian football hooligans in return, because they are people who take advantage of the Milosevic regime in the most shocking manner. Now that the Stability Pact will be coming into its own, the help of the neighbouring states will provide a new and sound alternative, especially now that Croatia has experienced a political U-turn. Alternative reports can be directly provided via stations in Croatia and also in Montenegro. The Stability Pact can only succeed if Serbia is a democratic constitutional state, not before, and once the criminals have been brought to justice. As long as Milosevic and his friends can introduce laws which undermine the traditional human rights and human freedoms, as long as this is the case, the outlook for Serbia remains bleak. It is unfortunate that the internal opposition is so weak and so divided nationally. The European Union will need to look for powers in Serbia which are not driven by this blinkered nationalism but by values whose observance has also proved to benefit humanity in the European Union. Mr President, we will gladly support our compromise resolution, especially once the GUE/NGL has pulled out.	el
We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large, we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women, and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today. Furthermore, we want values that women consider important, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security and environmental protection, to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and, if possible, throughout the world. In order to achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has, until now, been essentially imbued with masculine values. We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for. Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory: not over men, not over anyone, but the victory of equality between men and women. We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities, and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now, and particularly women, concerns the new economy and the new information technologies. The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women. The rate of employment in Europe, which is much lower than in the United States and Japan, must be increased. We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall. I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit to ensure that the new economy and the new Europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women. Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why I was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the Member States where the political representation of women is a success, such as, for example, in Finland, France and Sweden, and equally, you had the courage to list the Member States where things in this respect are not going so well, such as, for example, my own country and Greece too, which you forgot to mention. Moreover, I have heard that for the next elections, it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece. I think this is a very sad state of affairs. I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda. This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution. I myself, Commissioner, am a product of quotas. I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result. It appears that the meritocracy in a number of our European countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance.	fr
Between 1998 and 1999, loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people, while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people. Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193, while those against republicans totalled 97. Since January 2000, there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans, loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults, one leading to another murder, while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults. Mr President, that situation cannot continue and needs remedying. Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union. This is a task which all MEPs, the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature: the creation, as has been said already, of an area of freedom, security and justice. The Tampere Council, the motor and architect of this objective, has proposed certain goals, but five years, the time scale laid down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty, is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require. My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed, especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens, as the Commissioner has explained very well. My second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system, adopting common procedural rules and, above all, putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons. The recent laws on aliens adopted in my country, Spain, and in Belgium, are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy. My third and final point relates to the external activities of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum. We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants. We must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the East and the Mediterranean area, but we must do so with rigour, with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions, which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential needs. Finally, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship. The Euro, employment, even security, are not enough. They need a 'European soul' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said. Mr President, unlike some of the previous speakers, I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino. This trio's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said. As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated. Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months.	fr
This phenomenon is particularly marked in France: the GNP of the Champagne-Ardennes region, which it is my honour to represent, has gone from 105% to 94% of the Community average, that of the Loire region has dropped from 95% to 91%, and that of the Auvergne from 89% to 83%. This is a generalised tendency, sparing neither the Rh√¥ne-Alpes, nor Alsace. It has been confirmed in Sweden and Finland, countries where unemployment has in fact increased to a worrying degree over the last few years, as in many regions of the United Kingdom. It may therefore seem strange that, when the Structural Funds were reformed, Objective 2, dedicated to industrial and rural areas undergoing economic restructuring, should have been sacrificed in favour of Objectives 1 and 3. For the period 1999-2006, the total appropriation for this Objective will be ECU 22.5 billion, a figure more or less identical to that for the period 1994-1999. The rural regions eligible under Objective 5b will be included among the main victims of this situation: in France, 27% of the populations eligible for Structural Funds are going to lose their eligibility at the end of the transition period, a figure which is occasionally much larger in some regions such as the Loire region, Alsace or Lower Normandy, political strongholds of the right-wing that were the victims of the petty political vote chasing of the left-wing coalition government. Based as it is on such choices, it is to be doubted whether regional policy can contribute to harmonious regional planning within the Member States of the European Union. von Wogau Report (A5-0069/1999) . (FR) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment, the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration. As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today. The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries. This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996. It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened. It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration. Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained. . (PT) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy, the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion. Issues of mergers and state aid however, still remain within the notification system. The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy, moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice, and even aims at having specialised courts. This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States. On the other hand, as the rapporteur points out, in the name of competition policy, public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies, with the privatisation of important industries and public companies, as has happened in Portugal, with harmful consequences for the country and its workers.	de
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures. It is fair to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament. However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives. Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure, for example, that the enlargement process can succeed. I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate. But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reformed, it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission. Mr President, the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997, but in reality it does not deserve it. 1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability. It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission' s remit. The new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals, and I must admit that I am not impressed at all. The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one' s friends unfortunately still exists. There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start. I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly. I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO. I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter. I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information. From the outside, it looks as if the Commission has something to hide. My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case. The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission. It was this practice which led to the Commission' s downfall. I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents. Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work. Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission.	fr
Certain isolated passages in the Commission' s proposal perhaps err on the side of caution, as is the case when it is maintained that the detainee accused should be given the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of preliminary enquiries. I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation. Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link. These are nevertheless minor flaws, which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote. The rapporteur has made laudable efforts, which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him. The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account. There is, as has already been said, one point still to resolved, which is also the most delicate one: it concerns article 18 of the convention, which relates to the interception of communications originating in one Member State, but which are directly performed by another Member State, without the assistance being requested of the State in which the interception is being carried out, something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology. This is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse. It could be maintained that in overall terms the legislation proposed is better than nothing, but to the Commission it nevertheless appeared insufficient and far from reassuring. It thus merits further reflection which, at a time in which the ambivalent reports on ECHELON are evoking shades of Big Brother, should probably go into greater detail on the means and methods to be used, on the one hand, to safeguard the rights of the individual, and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime. The objective is thus to achieve, as closely as possible, a fine balance between the fight against organised crime and respect for personal freedoms and the dignity of the individual: an objective which now specifically applies not only to the Member States, but also to the Union, which is aspiring to become a common area of freedom, justice and security. This is a distant goal, but is one that can be attained in stages. The most important thing will be the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States, but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward, as it is a step in the right direction. Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement. It points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal. The lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty. Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters. Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely, and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 18 allows interception in another Member State without its involvement. Not only should this be deleted, the whole interception title should be scrapped. An initiative of the FBI drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation. The Council proposal containing those requirements, ENFOPOL 98 was approved by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report.	de
The date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted. Finally, I want to repeat that I am convinced that LIFE will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the Community' s environmental policy. Parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument. I am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible, especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the Member States and in other countries, especially among the applicant States which are now being given the opportunity to participate in LIFE. Thank you, Mrs Wallstr√∂m. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. Modernising social protection The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000), by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)].  Mr President, the issue of social security systems is an important one. This is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU. The basis is monetary cooperation, which has since been followed up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy. It is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems. These areas are mutually dependent upon one another. Economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment. It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision. But the reverse is also the case: a well-developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth. In other words, social security is a factor of production. Social security systems differ from one EU country to another. This is largely due to historical factors. We are now faced with a number of common challenges, however; demographic development, for example, which has to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the lower birth rate. The labour market is also changing. Women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers. Another challenge is presented by technical development. We must meet these challenges together. The Commission' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared, a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced. What is more, the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment. This is good, but it is not enough. We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process. Clear guidelines and indicators are required. At the same time, the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans. We are creating a common model, but retaining the principle of subsidiarity. This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period. Parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high-level group, but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on.	el
In order to safeguard uniform case law and prevent differing interpretations, case law should continue to be the preserve of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg which, thanks to the quality of its case law on the 1950 Convention over the past 40 years, has provided a dynamic instrument which takes full account of the social, economic and ethical developments within our society. The discrepancies or inconsistencies which might result from various ideologically informed views can be seen in the position of the Committee on Women' s Rights which is calling, for example, for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to contain a clause banning discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation but maintains that family rights as such do not exist. We need to be wary of perhaps well-meant, generous proposals if we want to prevent decision processes in the EU being crippled by a plethora of recourse proceedings which would mean more than doubling the number of judges at the European Court of Justice, and nobody would know where to enforce their basic rights any more or how long they must wait for a judgement. - (SV) We welcome the work which has now begun on preparing an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. A Charter of this kind will have a very important symbolic value and will strengthen the confidence of our citizens in the EU and in European integration. The Charter of Fundamental Rights should be seen as complementing the European Convention on Human Rights, which we believe should be incorporated into the Treaty. The Charter should concentrate on the relationship between citizens and the European institutions. Its primary objective should be to guarantee that the Union is governed openly. The Charter should be legally binding through its also being incorporated into the EU' s Treaty. The Charter must not only be a declaration, but also entail obligations of some kind on the part of the EU' s institutions and Member States. We would emphasise the subsidiarity principle and the fact that the Charter should concentrate on the fundamental freedoms and rights of citizens, as presented in accordance with the Member States' common constitutional traditions. We would emphasise the importance of the social dimension in the EU' s activities but consider that social policy is mainly a question for each individual Member State to decide upon. - (FR) The Charter of Fundamental Rights is the latest manifestation of the drift of Community legislation towards a constitution. In fact, the significance of this document is obvious if it is regarded as a potential preamble to a European constitution; conversely, it would be redundant in those Member States that already include these rights in their own constitution and legal traditions and confirm them by ratifying international texts such as the European Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is easy enough to think of ways to improve the application of the existing texts; but the technocratic nature of the process of European integration becomes quite obvious again today from the decision to draft an additional document, which could hardly be anything but repetitive.	el
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct. A number of codes have since been introduced. They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding. The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries, most notably the United Kingdom, and institute a committee for standards in public life, with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions. Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected. At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers. They must be implemented without delay. Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong. Crucially, reforms must not be limited to the Commission. Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules, administrative procedures and management practices. Finally, the Commission's human resource policy must be modernised. It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern, multinational organisation. The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue. A career with the European institutions must become more attractive. Too many young, new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years. Merit must be recognised and rewarded, specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade. The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent. Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed. It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions. It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders, or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States. Commissioner Kinnock will, tomorrow, present his communication on reform. This communication must contain a clear timetable. With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be. Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away. Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility. In June of last year Europe's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism. There is a very simple way to deal with those stories. Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism. Mr President, I do not want to be misunderstood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am, of course, in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate, necessary reforms. This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about. All the experts can provide information and news, formulate opinions and give advice, but, they have no political or elective responsibility, and rightly so. I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which, on some occasions, I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive. I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone, and no one else, can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case, the European Parliament' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward, as it should.	fi
". (IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy' s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined. In the first place, if administrative procedures are not simplified, it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform, with a view to greater efficiency and concentration. In this respect, the Commission document has shortcomings, as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities, and for their funding, execution and monitoring. SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still ""weak operators"" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds. A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time. In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report), the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact, it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States, and it published the guidelines back in July 1999, even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties, thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines. This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance. In general, the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent. They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries. That said, the differing approach adopted in the guidelines, which are not geared to geographical objectives, but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive. While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions, we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows, in practice, a policy of integrated interventions, for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary. We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention.  The guidelines, as adopted by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance, they are providing a shopping list of possible measures, a shopping list which, as it fails to set priorities in ascending order, could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration. We could say that, in this state of affairs, we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and, hence the destruction of the countryside. There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument, which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and, moreover, would accord proper status to local bodies which, being independent, could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly, and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency, concentration and administrative reform."	fi
As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January, the needs of the severely affected fisheries, ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account. We therefore now call upon the Commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds. Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks. We cannot understand how it is that experiences like the Urquiola or Amoco Cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience. Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this. We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen. The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate. It is time that polluters started to pay because, up to now, it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid, and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well. I am therefore delighted at Mr Fischler' s response, particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted. On behalf of the PSE Group, I want to send a message of solidarity to those affected, to the fishermen, farmers and businesspeople who enable the products of the sea to be regularly brought to market. My message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians, to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support. I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner. Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable. The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people. The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission' s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly. It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified, where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two. The Erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address. This question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future. The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern, and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this, is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of Erika in future. Will it really address the concern or will, in practice, in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas, the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause. Mr President, our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster, but good intentions are not enough, there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment. We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation, and for this to be backdated. We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection, and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority, and also, in particular, of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory. We further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats. Finally, we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic, with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million. This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products. This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment.	fi
Given the ever increasing volume of traffic on Europe's roads I am at pains to emphasise the need for vehicles to meet the highest possible technical roadworthiness standards, but also the need to take environmental aspects into account. Although - and I should like to say this most emphatically - it is also necessary, if the directive is not only to pay lip service to these ideals, for it to be applied by the Member States and invested with appropriate penalties. The best directive will be ineffective in everyday life if it does not provide any penalties for non-compliance or violations. I therefore support the amendments providing for guilty parties to be punished, because the operation of motor vehicles, which in principle presents a risk and entails a potential danger to people, must be supervised properly and with the necessary care and expertise. In any case we must prevent this from being dealt with thoughtlessly, precisely because this is about a directive which provides for rules not only for heavy goods vehicles but also for commercial vehicles carrying people. Time and again we are all severely shaken when there are major accidents which are due purely to technical defects. Because of this I am glad that the report is not actually controversial and that Parliament is once again proving to be the driving force in the debate about traffic safety on Europe's roads. My particular thanks go to all those who work with such dedication in this field in the committee, in the Commission and in the Council. Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, the purpose of the proposal the Commission made in 1998 is to replace the directive concerning annual inspections of commercial vehicles. The motion proposes the introduction of spot checks, as vehicles have to be deemed roadworthy between tests too. These spot tests may be carried out at the roadside, at ports and harbours or where trucks are parked. This is, then, a matter of improving road safety in the EU, which is vital. The damage caused by lorries in traffic accidents is, more often than not, considerable and the state of vehicles is very patchy in different parts of Europe, so pan-European legislation and strict compliance with it will be of benefit to each and every person on the road. A major cause of concern in the European Union area is the poor state of the trucks coming from Eastern Europe. They need to be dealt with strictly. Being from East Karelia, I know that even if they had one light and the wheel brakes on one side working, it would be something. The Council' s common position will improve road safety considerably, and the directive should enter into force as soon as possible. In establishing penal systems, however, it is important to realise that penalties must on no account be targeted at the Member State, but the driver or company involved. Enlightenment is a good thing, but, unfortunately, only proper penalties have an effect on hypocrites.	el
Mr President, I would particularly like to thank the rapporteurs and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for having adopted a position in favour of the EU becoming a party to the Council of Europe' s Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. I hope that this position will be retained in tomorrow' s sitting, as it will be vitally important if we wish to avoid confusion with the many various schemes in respect of fundamental rights. I would like to raise the issue of reinforcing the political rights of citizens with the help of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In my view, there has not to date been so much discussion on the subject. If, however, we were to examine what a citizen of the European Union today can actually do, how much he or she can influence the decision-making process, we would see that there are not so many opportunities to do so. Citizens can mainly stand as candidates in elections and vote in another EU country. But why should we not establish some new institutions and instruments, by means of this Charter, enabling citizens to have a real influence? Why, for example, could we not take up the notion that a certain number of citizens - let us say from three different EU countries - could formulate a citizens' initiative that then could be channelled though the European Parliament? Why can we not look to the future and see that it will be ever more important for our citizens to be able to take part directly in decision-making in other ways too? I think it would be natural for this to form part of the Charter and very little has been said about this so far. During this past century, Europe has experienced two terrible wars, immeasurable tragedies, but, at the same time, it has witnessed unrestrainable civil, cultural and social progress. The working masses fought, and achieved and consolidated positive results which protected their rights, and which, at the same time, played a decisive role in the development of democracy. It is a bitter surprise to find that there is no specific, explicit reference in this document to those social rights which are, in actual fact, the most important part of the immense democratic process which became established in Europe during the course of the century. I am referring to essential rights, without which democracy is not true democracy: freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and of association and so on are the basic framework of democracy, but within that framework and from that framework must emerge a healthy, solid structure which is a perfect combination of freedom and justice. First and foremost, a document such as this cannot fail to include a specific, indisputable reference to the right to work. It cannot and must not be without this reference. Yes, social rights are mentioned, but they should be clearly and practically defined: the right to work, the right to health, the right to education, the right to housing, to a pension, the right, that is, to life, to a life where all have equal opportunities, according to those principles of libert√© [freedom] and √©galit√© [equality] which have played such a major part in our extensive history. For this reason, therefore, I ask Parliament to approve the small number of explicit amendments tabled by Mr Kaufmann and myself on this subject. - (PT) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, the only really fundamental thing about the idea of a Charter of Fundamental Rights for the Union is an attempt, under the guise of appearing to be generous, to take a step towards the so-called constitutionalisation of the Treaties, or even more directly, towards a European constitution for a European State. For this reason, we are against it. We are not questioning the content of such a charter. We come from a country whose constitution contains one of the most extensive enumerations of fundamental rights anywhere. We also belong to a party that was forged in the struggle for democracy, and one of whose greatest concerns has always been the steadfast promotion of human rights. We oppose the charter, however, because in the idea behind it, we detect a kind of Trojan horse for federalism, a political trap which would entail other serious political and legal consequences for the Member States and peoples of Europe. We do not think that it would be correct, and certainly not appropriate, to impair and disturb the balance of the Treaties at present.	fi
I feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature, resulting from investments in continuous training, refresher courses, adaptability and retraining of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives, that are always debatable, regarding new employment or employment cuts. If, among other things, as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well, the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue, focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge, in other words, a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules, this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes. Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, you have come here today, Mr Prodi, in a very reformist and ambitious mood. I welcome you and your ambition. Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us. In order to make these reforms, however, and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme, we must be very sure, not only of the strengths of the reformer himself, but also of the opinions of others. You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice. We have 1.27% of the Community' s GDP. Not a euro more or a euro less. It will not be us who refuse these new resources. You should ask the Council. These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre. In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans, we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4, and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget. I would remind you that this Group, the PPE-DE, does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones. The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs. Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system. It is all very well for us, by mutual consensus, to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation, but you must be very aware that the lack of resources, the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget, continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved. We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them. Madam President, the Commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever.	de
I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects, indebtedness, assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety, humanitarian, educational and health-related issues, and also fields such as the environment, investment and access to information and new technologies. This also applies to the sphere of trade, where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies, and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States. We cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed. Mr President, having listened to the Council and the Commission today, I just had to look at my agenda. Yes, it does say: 'Coherence of different Union policies with development policy' . But we have not heard a single word on this subject, and I find that deeply embarrassing. We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years. It ought to have been here in writing today and, after having heard Mr Nielson' s speech, I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission. I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence, and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today. Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence, I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism, namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new, relevant legislation from this aspect. I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the EU' s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries: dumping of beef in Sahel and South Africa, tomato pur√©e in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica. The examples are, I hope, all well known. In any case, they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU-subsidised products. European taxpayers contribute EUR 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the EU. This is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries, which accounts for 69% of the total work force there compared with 1.7% in the EU. Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34% of the developing countries' gross national product, compared with 5.3% in the EU. There is neither coherence nor human decency here. Why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact? Mr President, how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council. They pointed out that the UK, France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population. They then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto.	el
Many forces came together to reach agreement on Article 13 in the last Intergovernmental Conference, as the representative of the Council has already reminded us, and the Commission is determined to honour the Treaty commitment to a discrimination-free society. That is why we put forward our package of proposals to fight discrimination only two months after taking office last year. My message today, in the follow-up to the Ludford report, is that we still hope that Parliament will give priority to giving its opinion on this package so that we can adopt the two directives and the action plan by the end of this year. But besides that, I think that in many quarters there is growing recognition of the need for European action against racism. That is why in the Article 13 proposals we are able to make greater progress, I believe, on racial discrimination than on the other matters. We felt that it was politically possible. We sincerely hope that the facts will not deny our hope. As you know, the package of proposals that the Commission has put forward consists of two directives and an action programme. The two draft directives provide a legislative framework for legally enforceable rights including provisions on a number of key issues such as protection against harassment, scope for positive action, appropriate remedies and enforcement measures. The proposed directives are complemented by a proposal for an action programme. We know that, to combat discrimination, practical action is needed to reach out to people and help change discriminatory attitudes and behaviour on the ground. Getting the Member States to adopt the anti-discrimination package is now our top priority. Although it is important, the Article 13 package is only part of an on-going process to develop new ways of tackling racial discrimination. The Union is committed to mainstreaming the fight against discrimination on the basis of race and ethnic origin, and we recently organised a major conference on this issue. We intend to keep pushing the process forward, through the Structural Funds, the Research Framework Programme, the European Employment Strategy, the new EQUAL Initiative and the new Social Action Programme which we hope to adopt in the summer. We intend to use all these instruments to fight discrimination and, as you know, work has also started on the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Parliament has a key role to play in this regard. It is vital for the Commission that the Parliament contributes to the growing momentum surrounding these proposals by delivering its opinions on the package as soon as possible, and by participating fully in the work of drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I will conclude as I have started: the Charter will represent the high priority that the Union as a whole accords to the fight against racism and discrimination and to protection of human rights. I sincerely hope that, during our debate on this issue next year, we will be congratulating ourselves on achieving, with the Charter, a new tool to fight against racism and xenophobia in the Union.	el
What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation. How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area? Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area? The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour, but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member. The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan. The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive. That means that any development that takes place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the Community' s Habitats Directive. Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan, which are now designated a part of the special protection area, and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed. After investigating these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the Structural Funds - the Commission became convinced, in the summer of 1999, that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour. An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out. The most serious harm caused by the project, the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats, was only to be temporary, and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats. At the Commission's suggestion, the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area, from which they had previously been excluded. Furthermore, to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats, the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved. However, since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute. Firstly, the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements. They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts. However, the new commitment included some minor changes which, in turn, led to a further complaint. In view of the fact that the Irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved, the Commission will not, for the present, propose that financial support from the Structural Funds should be suspended. However, it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities, particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts.	fr
Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States. Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement. What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this. For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States. After five years only four have done so. This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office. There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity. We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised. The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process. We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals. In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established. I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment. The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings. The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF. The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency. The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and to OLAF' s relationship with the national authorities. There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States. The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts. In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called corpus juris, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared. Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men. The Commission, Mr Barnier, Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea. I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority. We can set another example here, to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular, fraud, and to mete out punishment where necessary. Mr President, I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato.	de
"We are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the 14 Member States have employed on this issue. The resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the Member States' national identities and constitutional traditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty. What is also missing is a paragraph concerning the EU' s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in Europe and Austria which have been among the prior conditions for Mr Haider' s electoral success. Today, as previously in the history of Europe, right-wing extremism is the result of insecure social and economic conditions of life. The policy of cut-backs which has followed in the wake of adjusting to EMU has promoted the successes of right-wing extremism. A radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in Europe. - (DE) I am making this statement on behalf of the CSU. It is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State. It has no right to do so. Instead of prematurely condemning the FP√ñ and the Austrian Government which is being formed, there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition. Only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe. This does not mean that we sympathise with Haider. The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FP√ñ. However, as politicians we must ask the question why 27% of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FP√ñ at the elections in October 1999. We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results. Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FP√ñ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics. However, the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem. For these reasons the CSU European delegates are against this resolution. ""He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen-chests; that it bides its time in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, and bookshelves; and that perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city."" It is with these phrases that Albert Camus, at the close of the long allegorical novel describing the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of Oran against the plague, reminds us, at the close of the Second World War, that the fight against Nazism, ""the brown plague"" as it was termed at the time, could not enjoy a definitive victory. That because racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear and rejection of what is different, have deep roots in all that is basest in humanity, they may re-emerge at any moment and take over any group of human beings. In this light, the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic. For the first time since the Second World War, a party which is openly pro-Nazi, racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a European country. Confronted with this threat, which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe, nothing must deter us: not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit, not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene, not the derisory respect for formal democracy, and, above all, not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control. As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of R√©union, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exup√©ry, ""In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!"""	fi
However, shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution. Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us. Not the report he presented to us here today, but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because politically speaking, these are two completely different reports. In very general terms, we could call the first report a left-wing one, as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones. The report we have before us now and which Mr Katiforis is reluctant to defend - and I think that he is right in this - is a hybrid report, from which the main conclusions have been removed, and is based on social concerns. What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report? He proposed an ambitious report, based on an optimistic Europe, which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve. And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets. Why, for example, was the proposal to increase Europe' s active population to 75% of the total population removed, when we currently have levels of around 60%? An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries' levels of production with such a low rate of employment. We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive. As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training. We also need investment to grow at a faster rate. We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce. I would like to counter this with the example of Portugal, where employment laws are not flexible, and where unemployment stands at less than 5% - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing, with Community support of course, at a rate considerably higher than the Community average. What we want, therefore, is for Europe to enjoy economic growth, but also be prepared to address social issues. Mr President, like many others, I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report. When I read the report and see the picture of the EU' s economy that is described there, I think it is quite a worrying picture. Investment levels are too low, unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth. It is not, therefore, perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies, in spite of rumours to the effect that the European Central Bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it. The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself, which is something I agree with. There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development. As far as I am concerned, EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy. My conclusions about this differ completely, however, from those of the previous speaker. I believe we have to place our confidence in human resources, partly through a macro-economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly - and perhaps above all - by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training, democratisation and good social conditions.	de
". I wish to put on the official record my concerns with the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote. We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water. There is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur. However, the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which, under the rules of subsidiarity, should be left to the Member States for decision. In my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue. In Ireland all the major users of water, commercial, industrial and agricultural, already pay for their use of water. This is a decision of national and local government, and this is where all future decisions should be retained. These are the main reasons for my vote. . The European Union is currently in the process of adopting new EU water legislation to update and to establish a long-term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters. I support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy. However, I do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used. Water, in this context, is a commercial commodity. It is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life. We see it as positive that an attempt is being made to reverse the trend towards water degradation, which is most alarming and which governments all too often tend to sweep under the carpet. We all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved. But it is also essential to bear in mind that the various elements of water policy cannot be separated, and that action on this aspect will affect all the others. The ""physico-chemical and ecological quality of water"" was highlighted during the debate and in the proposals, and the adverse effects of other aspects was, at best, touched upon marginally. It is essential to be aware of the widely varying situations in different Member States, such as specific climatic conditions, water regimes and fluctuations in them over the year, the social, economic and ecological effects of applying standards, and also of the failure to do so. It was because of our concern about these issues that we disagreed with some of the proposals put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and in particular those relating to an excessively restrictive timetable and to the scant attention paid to social and agricultural aspects, which are very important for a country like Portugal, which suffers from water shortage problems and also inadequate socio-economic development. But we also believe that, in many cases, the proposals put forward by the Commission and the Council represent too much of a step backwards, which is why we would like to see a vote balanced between the various requirements in the proposals presented to us."	el
That is certainly the view of my colleague, Commissioner Wallstr√∂m, who I know would have wished to respond to this resolution in person today. The reason she cannot do so is because, as some honourable Members have pointed out, she is in Hungary and Romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to tackle the crisis. We stand ready to do so. We contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently. The Romanians have approached UNEF and OCHA, in Geneva, for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts. We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed. That is obviously crucial. It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it. It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged. There is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the Romanian authorities. This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested. The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy. It is mirrored in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be applied in this case. The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due. The Union has mobilised some EUR 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the Danube River basin. In the context of pre-accession aid to the region it may be possible to redirect some of the assistance we are giving under ISPAR and PHARE to tackle the most severe impact of this accident, as long as the polluter-pays principle is fully respected. We will want, in the longer term, to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster, above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place. The incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of European civil protection, along the lines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two Members today. But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis. As I have said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallstr√∂m, is on the spot today. She will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit. This has been an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future. The debate is closed. We shall now proceed to the vote. VOTE . (FR) The only reason we voted for the PSE-Verts/ALE-GUE/NGL compromise motion for a resolution is because this resolution allowed us to condemn the decision by the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its factory in Italy. However, the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and exacerbating unemployment. Moreover, it is all just words, because the Socialist governments, which are now in a majority in Europe, are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right-wing governments. The real problem is not finding a legal way of slightly complicating redundancy procedures, but banning them. The only way of stopping the diabolical machine which produces capital gains on the one side and unemployment on the other is to ban redundancies in all large companies which are in profit, on pain of compulsory purchase, and to publish the accounts of large companies and subject them to the scrutiny of the workers and the general public. Society must have the means of enforcing its own agenda on large companies and their owners. The first item on that agenda is the eradication of unemployment. The sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone, without cutting wages, must be taken from the profits of large companies.	fi
But the EPP it seems, and others opposite, clearly do not want that. We heard a few moments ago a disgraceful speech from Mr Gollnisch on behalf of his party. Mrs Palacio, who is just leaving, has said that human rights are needed in a public place and at the core. And yet, by their amendments to the Ludford report, they seek to divide Europe and to make millions of our brothers and sisters from the ethnic minorities second-class citizens. That is the clear aim of the amendments in the name of Mr Hernandez Mollar and his colleagues and this is consistent throughout all the amendments on behalf of the EPP - the so-called European People's Party - which actually reveals itself in its amendments as a party for some of the people but not all of them. The EPP's amendments seek to divide families. They object to family unity. Their Amendment No 12 seeks to delete reference to the need for family unity in Europe. The EPP, it seems, do not accept that ethnic minorities feel alienated from the electoral process. They do not feel that the European Parliament and national parliaments should reflect Europe's diverse ethnic nature. That is the aim of Amendment No 13. It deletes that from the report. They are against ethnic diversity and they do not accept the benefits given to our society by all its people. They do not accept that everyone has a part to play in the electoral process. We cannot complain about what is going on in the candidate states if we have amendments like this being put forward in the European Union. Nor, it seems, does the EPP believe that ethnic minorities should be encouraged to vote. Their Amendment No 21 deletes the call for encouragement to the ethnic minority to take part in elections to vote or stand as candidates. Is that what we want? I do not think it is. We, on this side of the House, reject that position completely. We will publicise the EPP position and their amendments whether they are passed or not. We deplore the line that Mr Hernandez Mollar and his colleague have put forward. We urge the Liberal Group to dissociate themselves from their links with the EPP over the amendments because it has shown itself to have racist instincts in its party. Should the EPP amendments to this report be adopted we will oppose the whole report. The EPP amendments weaken the report and would make the position of this Parliament worse than at the moment. It would make it so weak that it would be one that we could not support. It would be a retrograde step. So, I urge all colleagues to reject the amendments put forward by the European People's Party and their colleagues on the far right. Mr President, I thank all those who have spoken on my report. I should just like to clear up a few misunderstandings. Firstly, nowhere does this report say that fighting racism means you should have no immigration controls.	el
I do, however, have one small concern, when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets. There was a clear agreement, good or bad I will not say, but there was a contract. There was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7, i.e. on the idea of linking the mobilisation, the implementation, of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment. But, if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira says correctly, then this undertaking was only a tentative one. Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement. Can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on Budgets, yes or no? Or are you going to drop this proviso, thus breaking the undertaking made to us? No, Mr Bourlanges, I think it is a substantive problem. The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted. What I proposed to you, and what I still say, is that the Commission will make a statement, in the Council Decision, something like this: The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors. With this, we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed. I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche. I agree, absolutely. We shall do so. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow. ALTENER The next item is the report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD)) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council. The project has been long and problematic. In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources. Although there is much that is good about the new directive, it is nonetheless not without its defects. One example is the use of peat. Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels. If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned. It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal. The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union' s dependence on imported energy.	fr
But there are some questions still outstanding. There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme. The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict. I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue. Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa. I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought, where the crops have failed, and where, in six months' time, we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands. At the same time, there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns, after which we will send the bread. First of all, Mr Andrews, you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development. There is no contradiction between our two positions, quite the opposite. Unless we wish to act like megalomaniacs, we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face, particularly in the area of external relations. As you can understand, it would be easy to do so. All we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme, one after the other. We are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments' ability to act and within the scope of the Council. We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve, particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes. You have mentioned Ethiopia, which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes, but there are, as you know, several Community actions to combat AIDS, and in this respect, you are right, and the United States will probably not do any better. Indeed, in terms of development aid policy, I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the United States. Your question switched to the subject of arms, a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will, of course, address in the future, if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context. Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the EU to developing countries at prices below the cost of production?	fr
On each occasion, people were given the ideological arms to carry out the attacks. There is also another type of racism which involves daily harassment and humiliation. This can be seen in the discrimination applied in access to housing, leisure facilities and employment. You will all be aware of the example, recently reported in the French press, of a young man from Strasbourg who sent two completely identical curricula vit√¶ to the same company. The name on one was foreign-sounding and the other was typically French. You can guess which 'applicant' was invited for interview. We cannot nowadays simply defend those described as minorities. Instead we must get them out of this ghetto. Rather than concentrating on protecting minorities, we should be building the concept of European citizenship involving common values. We should be concentrating on building a common future for everyone and a society in which everyone can develop and which totally rejects any hint of submission to barbarism. Throughout its history Europe has been capable of the best and the worst. The best is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Convention. The worst is colonialism, the Shoah, Stalinism and nazism. We must teach our children about all of this. We must clearly embrace everything which can strengthen Europe and reject anything which weakens it. At the same time we must send a clear message about the type of society we want to build. I will say plainly that those who regard as acceptable an alliance with extremists in order to win elections will be swept up and dumped in the dustbins of history. An alliance with the likes of Haider or Le Pen is like supping with the devil. You need a long spoon which will never be long enough. I would also remind those who advocate an ethnic concept of the nation that Cl√©menceau said that patriotism is the love of one' s country whereas nationalism is the hatred of others. These people have clearly chosen their side. All these fine words must now lead to concrete action and practical legislative steps. Legislation against racism must be harmonised. The words must take on real meaning. Equal opportunities means allowing all children born on European soil to become European citizens and to enjoy the right of nationality of the country in which they are born. Equal rights means being entitled to vote and fighting against all forms of discrimination, whether spatial, geographical, social or racial. This is how we can positively support the values for which we are fighting. Mr President, as I stressed yesterday, I feel it is significant that we are confronting the issue of human rights here in France, for, along with North America, France could be called the birthplace of these universal principles. However, it appears that we are not always completely sure which rights we are talking about and that we are introducing or we want to introduce rights which are not provided for in the Conventions or the international Treaties. For example, the right to immigration does not exist. Of course, an immigrant coming from outside the Union has the right to enjoy his rights, but imposing limits or controls on immigration cannot be classed as racism or xenophobia, for the very reason that there is no mention of a right to immigrate in any text. Moreover, the idea of completely uncontrolled immigration is unimaginable, if only for reasons of space and numbers. And, in addition, there are duties which should sometimes be remembered as well as rights. For example, we have been talking about the Roma. Of course, the Roma have rights and should not be discriminated against, but many of them, and I am not saying the majority, but certainly a large number of them, as has been statistically proven, do not live lawful lives. Many of them abuse their women and, more importantly, their children. Ill-treated, ragged children are often to be seen on the streets, and this is a conscious situation calculated to arouse the pity of passers-by and to induce them to give them some money.	fi
So do you have a feeling about how these discussions may develop in the IGC? Mr Turmes, the extension of codecision on legislative matters is an issue which the Intergovernmental Conference has been considering and, as you know, the more radical position traditionally adopted by many Member States is that all legislative decisions adopted by a qualified majority in the Council should be submitted to the European Parliament under the codecision process. Although this position has been explicitly welcomed in the ICG, there are some Member States who advocate a case-by-case approach on the use of the codecision procedure, even where legislative decisions are concerned. With regard to ratification of international agreements, I have already been able to raise this issue at the ICG, and when it was first discussed this request and traditional position of the European Parliament did not receive what might be called a ready welcome from the Member States. Although this item is still on the table, as all these issues are kept on the agenda until the end of the conference, it does seem to us at this stage that there is unlikely to be any significant progress on this. Nevertheless, we will continue to maintain a dialogue with the European Parliament on this subject. Next Tuesday I shall be attending a meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs at which I will make sure to discuss this issue and to explain in a little more detail how the ICG preparatory group is dealing with questions like this, and in particular the list of requests and proposals presented by the European Parliament, which we hope will be supplemented by the resolution to be voted upon on 23 March. Question No 6 by (H-0160/00):  Subject: Compensation for victims of fascist war Many rulings by Greek courts have confirmed that Greek citizens are entitled to compensation as victims of the nazi regime, while the war reparations which Germany owes Greece remain in abeyance and have not yet been paid. Repayment of a loan which Germany extracted from the Bank of Greece during the occupation in 1943 also remains outstanding. In the light of the recent agreement signed by Germany on compensation of DM 10 billion for forced labour in German industry, will the Council take steps to ensure that the victims of the fascist war are given their rightful compensation and that the loans extracted during the occupation are repaid, bearing in mind that, since the unification of Germany, not even the formal reason that Germany adduced for not settling these legitimate and valid claims now applies? I can answer the honourable Member' s question quite easily: this issue does not fall within the competencies of the Council. It is a matter for bilateral relations between Greece and German and the Council is not, therefore, willing to take any action, let alone the action recommended by the honourable Member. Mr President, the reply by the President-in-Office puts me in mind of the reply by Pontius Pilate. How exactly do things stand? During the occupation, the German Government forced the Greek Government to give it a loan, which today, with interest and inflation, totals some USD 25 billion.	el
In Tampere, the question of granting operational powers was discussed. We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control. The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC. Parliament has amended the contractual text. Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament' s modus operandi. Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them. Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors. And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe. Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers, I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months. Mr President, Commissioner, the oral question tabled by Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠ shows that this House is taking a firm stance. Indeed, six months after the election of this new Parliament, we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe. I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this. We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice. Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems. This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres. For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged. A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism, xenophobia, nationalism and extreme-right racist movements. We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees. The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable. All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect. Last week, and somewhat by chance, I witnessed, at Roissy airport, a scene of rare violence in which two young women, admittedly illegal immigrants, were being returned to Conakry. They were treated like the worst criminals. They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair, surrounded by a horde of state security police. The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour. Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships. The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed. Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund, we could take the decision to set this up. The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though this summit provided an important basis. Likewise, we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action.	de
And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference. As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.  Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today' s debate concerns the steel aid code, that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission. There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these. The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly. Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future. The European Commission' s decisions, which feature in the report, are welcomed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty. The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament. As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry. According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle. Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases. Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid. In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany. Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid. The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996. These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether. In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece. However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report. As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired. There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code. No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe. This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years. Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations. We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind. The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission' s supervision. We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires, steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94, for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.	de
As Members of Parliament, we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever. It is more important than ever that respect for, and non-violation of, human values and the rights of minorities, including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the European Union, form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU, and, for this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding. It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration. As important is the fact that Austria' s forces of democracy should be given support, as none of us wishes to isolate the country. We know that most Austrians respect these values. They have also shown how they feel: not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria. Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time. I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy. I also appeal to the Austrian President, that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces. Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group, Francis Wurtz, reminded us of just now. I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes J√∂rg Haider' s party. The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because, as you know, we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit and the Member States' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans. Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today: this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational, neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary. This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe. We are talking about us, not Austria. We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe. Not only the Alpine region, but all our countries are involved: the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat. The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation. Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past. Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak on this, making the value of the presidency' s position even more apparent. This is the change we must impose on the Commission' s action. Madam President, despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, which opposes fascism, nazism or communism, both new and old, and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament.	de
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still! We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions, and still less of improving them. - (FR) In voting against this report, we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic. We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services, in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster, killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations. This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century. Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere, culture or cooperation with the third world, excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity. Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy? We are convinced that the opposite is true, and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive. Excessive in comparison with what iron rule, what criteria of efficiency? Finally, after Seattle, do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO? Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness. Jonckheer Report (A5-0087/1999) I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU, and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report, and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information, both general and specific, publicly accessible via its website. I am happy with the rapporteur' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this. There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition. Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union. However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158). Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission. The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997, including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector. This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector). This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German L√§nder.	de
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful. How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back? At present, there are no common rules in this area, and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment. This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition. Finally, we propose keeping both a register, as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs, and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid. You have shown us the way, Mr Monti, with the single market scoreboard. It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid. I very much hope that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these amendments, and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter. To conclude, I want to welcome the Commission' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy, on which, once again, a good deal of work has been done. But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness. There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid. This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who, in his report, has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria, as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition. As Liberals and Greens, we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look, but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives, and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems. Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered. Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy, and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy? Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid. It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements. So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified. The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level. We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything. We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact. Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union' s competition policy. But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us.	de
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating. In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations. In Grozny, there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat. Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you. Mr Gil-Robles told me that, when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night, the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities. The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well, if feasible. These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment. I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities. Madam President, this brings me to the end of my speech. I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning. I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission. This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations. Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world. Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana. I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Thank you, Mr Poettering. Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes. Commissioner, would you like to speak now or a little later? (The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later) Very well, thank you. Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Javier Solana, usted no es una persona loca, todo lo contrario (you are not mad, quite the opposite). We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit. We know that you have an important role in this. I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today, and in this context, and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question. We cannot, of course, talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya. My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group. I want to concentrate on Kosovo. It is now quite clear that the situation in Kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means. The KFOR forces have made, and are making, an invaluable contribution, but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term.	de
Of course, every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case. But there is a common factor, a hard core, comprising unemployment, the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprises, both commercial and other kinds. I would wish URBAN to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation. For this, of course, central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy, so that the latter too can be reorientated and can work synergistically with the objectives of any URBAN programmes implemented in our countries, and so that it is not just using them as an alibi for its own shortcomings. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine my observations to Mr Decourri√®re' s report. The INTERREG Community Initiative Programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of European territory, most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and its outlying regions. INTERREG must, therefore, be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory. It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme. Indeed, I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication, published on 13 October last year. Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III, I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme, financed by the ERDF, and the other external cooperation funds, including in particular the European Development Fund, intended for ACP countries. In this connection, I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds. The most remote regions, particularly the four French overseas departments, must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF in order to fund, in turn, cooperation projects with their ACP neighbours in their respective geographical areas. Furthermore, I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication. It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped. Finally, in conclusion, I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C, for interregional cooperation, even though the added value this offers the Community is undeniable. Mr President, my starting point is the EQUAL report and equality between men and women, although I must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue, which has a feeling of d√©j√† vu about it when you are my age, in any case. Unfortunately, it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality. A breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas, however. For me, equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a nanny, alias an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job. If that is the case, we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times. No, equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life. Unfortunately, developments are not moving in that direction. On the contrary. I think, therefore, that paragraph 7 contains something very central, i.e. that EQUAL will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies. One can only hope that it succeeds. I should just like to say, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, that if I am not here when the Commission responds - not that I have asked any specific questions, but I should nonetheless hope that the Commission has been paying attention - then that is because the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is meeting to discuss women in the decision-making process at the same time as the present debate is going on.	fi
This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation. We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations, but as a policy in its own right. I advocate transparent, joint and efficient development policy. As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money, it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States. Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible, so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way. Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense. As various Members have already commented, we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies, whose objectives run counter to development in those countries. And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and industry. We are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies. So there is a whole raft of contradictions. In my opinion, these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies. They are, if anything, more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States. We have to be aware of this. We often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world, as was recently the case with Indonesia, when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment. For me, these are the most serious contradictions in all this, more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies. We obviously know that, even within any one country, there are always contradictions between various policies. That is a fact of life. And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies, in this case development policy. We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them. The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one. I believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between Community policies and development and cooperation policy, and that this monitoring centre' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to Community policies, but should also cover Member States' actions and policies, including the actions of economic groups, which I think are also important. This monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction. I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House.	el
"I would like to know whether this clause has the same meaning in his language. Would the rapporteur be so kind as to inform us whether his version is the authentic version, for, if so, the meaning is the complete opposite to the Italian. Mr President, I believe I can shed some light on the matter. I have read the French version of the text, and it is completely different from the Italian version at this point. The Italian says ""not to imprison child abusers"", which seems absurd to me, whereas the French reads: ""not to imprison young people who commit offences"" which, I think, must be the original meaning. This a serious translation error. I feel sure that the Italian is a mistranslation. The original version probably said ""not to imprison young people who commit offences, except in special cases"" . I think this is the root of the problem. I am able to confirm that it is Mr Imbeni' s interpretation which is the correct one. The French, Danish and English versions are correct. The phrase is to be understood as Mr Imbeni said. Mr President, if we change the meaning of the paragraph, the debate will start all over again. It is a common occurrence in this Parliament for texts not to correspond. Do you remember when, a few months ago, we were told to distribute condoms to priests? This time, according to some versions, we are told to protect child abusers. If we change the English version as well, Mr President, we will have to start the debate afresh and, seeing as your plane leaves at 4.30 this afternoon, this does not seem appropriate. Maybe it would be better to stop at the comma, after ""physical and psychological abuse and all kinds of discrimination"" . We could then deal with the behaviour of young people who commit offences later on, in one of the many other reports which are churned out by Parliament. If the House could agree we could overcome all the difficulties that we have with the language versions by putting in as a separate paragraph itself - either as a sub-paragraph of 45 or as a new 45(a) - which says ""and urges them not to imprison young people who commit offences, except as a last resort"" . That would overcome all the difficulty. There is no ambiguity, there is no uncertainty. That is quite reasonable. It would follow between the existing paragraphs 45 and 46. Concerning paragraph 61: Mr President, a number of words have been omitted from paragraph 61 of the Danish version. It is the English version which is correct. In the Danish version, the following words should be added after the words ""trade unions"" : ""as well as the rights of individuals vis-√†-vis trade unions"" . It is, then, not only a question of the right to form trade unions but also of rights vis-√†-vis these trade unions. (Parliament adopted the resolution) As it happens, we have a report by Mr Provan in which the Bureau is looking at how the plenary functions. We had a debate on that in the Bureau on Tuesday and I made exactly the point you have just made."	el
We intend establishing a multi-annual work plan. We will refer to that on our website. I hope, therefore, that NGOs will feel involved in what we are doing. We depend a great deal on their active support and understanding. I should like to mention one other area which is of concern to them, even though they are not always so directly involved in it, namely the whole area of research, on which we spent EUR 17 million out of more than EUR 40 million in the last full year in 1998. But overall I can assure the honourable Member that we will be involving NGOs as much as possible. They have a great deal to contribute to this important work. Question No 41 by (H-0212/00):  Subject: 'Dialogue on Europe' initiative The President of the Commission intends to launch this initiative on 8 March 2000. The Commission's communication on the subject implies that the intention is to explain the consequences of the IGC 2000 to the public opinion of the Fifteen. Since this initiative falls under the PRINCE programme for providing information to the citizens of Europe, does the Commission intend to include the Charter of Fundamental Rights as one of the main themes of this initiative? Mr President, in agreement with the European Parliament, the Commission has taken the initiative of instigating what we are calling the 'Dialogue on Europe' which is intended to raise awareness regarding the issues involved in institutional reform in the context of the enlargement of the Union. The Commission considers that all the institutional matters liable to have a connection with the work of the Intergovernmental Conference should in fact come within the scope of the debate which has been initiated. This also, therefore, applies, and this is my answer to your question, to the matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of citizens. In complete agreement with Mr Vitorino, I can assure you of the Commission' s determination, in close collaboration with Parliament and your representatives, both at the Intergovernmental Conference and in the convention for negotiation of the charter, to promote dialogue on all current thinking on the future of the Union. This dialogue on Europe will be developed with all national and regional institutions, but also with opinion formers, the media and organisations in civil society. This is completely justified given the actual purpose of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the Commission for its reply. I am satisfied with it for two reasons. Firstly, it links the Charter of Fundamental Rights with the Intergovernmental Conference, which is the political objective of this Parliament expressed in the report by Messrs Duff and Voggenhuber. Secondly, because it is going to include it within this campaign. Furthermore, I was very pleased with Mr Lamy' s reply - which was inevitable, given that Mr Lamy knows these issues very well - concerning the decentralisation of the information campaign. I believe that this is an important objective because, if we want to reach the people, we have no choice but to go to where they are and, therefore, the decentralisation of the campaign is a priority task.	el
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying, in legal terms, the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which, although it might be called subsidiary, will always clash with the practice, and in certain areas, with the traditional, separate criminal law of the Member States? As there are doubts, would it not be more advisable, from a political point of view, to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda, and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor? Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom, security and justice? Mr President, the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny. Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged. To remedy this, vigorous efforts are required. We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently. At the same time, we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way. It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States. We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework. On the other hand, I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime. In the present situation, I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor, which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty. We have more confidence in Eurojust, where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate. The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered. The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is, however, to find the right mix. The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which, through an exaggerated supervision of detail, prevents the development of a modern administration. We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten' s report. The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision. Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness, decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision. The major challenge is, therefore, to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law. This requires staff training, more modern recruitment methods and, above all, openness and public control. Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities.	fr
This has been talked about for years. The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes, strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions, ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell. It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes. A proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines. It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational, procedural, financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union. Are these afflictions of the past, or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations? Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence. And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously, and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent, rather, we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect. For these are prerequisite to any development. If these criteria are not adhered to, then development does not stand a chance The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow. I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba. After all, we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International. It may well be that you, having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships, view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber, and that you have problems where good governance is concerned. Nonetheless, these are important criteria for the European Union. There is a second issue I would like to raise. We are discussing coherence here. Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent. In my view, however, the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too. There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another. Nor is there coherence vis-√†-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union' s budget but the EDF remains outside it. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13.5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control, and to bodies such as OLAF, then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability. This, to my mind, is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do, i.e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union. Mr President, we certainly must concede that, on balance, this text is full of good intentions, but we did not vote in favour of it in committee, nor shall we do so in plenary. We had two reasons for this, both of which gave rise to amendments which I should like to explain here very briefly.	de
Faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets, demand, as our motion recognises, is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world. No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information. In this respect, all ideas deserve to be considered, including the Tobin tax which is important, just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged. This tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy. It could release new resources for investment in people and, at a time when the UNDP estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year, it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs. When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators. The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this. I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and, like Mr D√©sir and several other speakers, I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect. In any case, the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone. Madam President, I too am delighted that we are having this debate. I only regret that it has been so long in coming. We know that each generation has, over the course of time, blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology. This is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism, but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations. Free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or, rather, the big mistake of our fin de si√®cle. This ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or, before that, the certainty, elevated to the status of a dogma, that the earth was flat. Our world is now dominated by a single logic or, I could say, a single god of money at work instead of people at work. With a figure for trade in goods and services of FRF 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days' speculation, the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals. It is self-perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man, the rich as much as the poor. Yet it is the latter who, at the end of the day, are excluded from the majority of the world' s decision-making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently, and very aptly, by Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement as the globalised √©lites.	fr
Its arrogance in relation to its treatment of Falun Gong practitioners and dissidents also cannot be tolerated. In Geneva, and elsewhere, the EU should take every opportunity in a united way to express its displeasure. While I strongly support China's admission to the WTO, we should give China a dose of its own medicine. We should use these negotiations as a means of leverage to ensure that China not only listens to EU concerns about its continued abuse of human rights but that it also takes action to improve its record. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to reinforce the protection of human rights in the European Union, we must firstly concern ourselves with the most vulnerable, i.e. essentially, the poorest. The most basic violation of human rights is the denial of each individual' s right to live decently. Respect for human dignity must be our guide. We must ensure that poverty is not allowed to destroy individuals and families, that children are not taken away from their parents because of poverty and that the simple right of association is not refused to those who do not even have the right to work. The aim is to create acceptable living conditions for all. Everyone must be protected from poverty and exclusion. Everyone is entitled to education, culture and health. Everyone is entitled to decent housing and an income which allows them to live honourably. We must declare that poverty will not be tolerated. We must declare that everyone is entitled to their physical and mental integrity and that this integrity involves the right to a decent life. Could the idea of fraternity become the key concept for the 21st century? Everyone has in them the enduring need to dream and through fraternity we could meet our main expectations for the poorest in society. Fraternity gives meaning to solidarity, rejects exclusion and solitude, and ensures respect for differences. Fraternity must guarantee the rights of the poorest. Our century will be a century of progress in which the wildest utopian ideals may be realised. Fraternity is one of these ideals and together, ladies and gentlemen, we can achieve it. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we are devoting part of our time in this Chamber to one of the most honourable aspects of our parliamentary work: the defence of human rights of all kinds and in all parts of the world. I would like to compliment the President on the wise decision to take these four reports together. While we may not be able to devote to each report the time its importance would merit, we can safely say, when we discuss human rights elsewhere, in the rest of the world, that we have not omitted to carry out a serious analysis of shortcomings here in the European Union itself. Whilst it is a fact - fortunately - that we here in the European Union are not faced with the gross violations that we rather unjustly criticise in other states, our own Member States still need to improve the way they respect these rights, economic and social rights, civil and political rights, with particular reference to respect for privacy and data protection for individuals, children' s rights, women' s rights and the rights of refugees who are immigrants here. And we still have a long way to go as regards violence by the police and in prisons, and in combating racism and xenophobia. With regard to third countries it is vital, and urgent, for the European Union to have a common strategy - to be prepared by the Council in consultation with this Parliament - which should consistently shape all the European Union' s policies, and in particular its development cooperation policy. It makes no sense in terms of Realpolitik for us to be more demanding in some areas than in others, for us to be more indulgent of some states than of others, and for us to pursue cooperation policies with some states that do not respect fundamental human rights, and where the rule of law has broken down and serious transgressions go unpunished. If we continue to give political and economic support to countries where this is happening, we will be condoning regimes that do not respect human rights, countries where we can legitimately question whether Community aid is reaching the people whose development we are endeavouring to promote, or whether we are simply maintaining the vanity, opulence and secret bank accounts of a handful of leaders.	fi
We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended. We will therefore vote for the Greens' Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position. As regards pricing policy, there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report. My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43, tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens' Amendment No 105. I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned. However, some people in our political group think otherwise. Consequently, Amendment No 107, on the same question, has been tabled by one section of our group only. On the whole, I welcome the committee's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise. Mr President, every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet, yet the abundance of water is an illusion. The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders. Water is a renewable but limited natural resource. It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable. In the EU, this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas. The increase in vulnerable areas, both wet and dry, inequalities between countries, inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic, economic, geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need. However, these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community. We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land. Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive. It is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought. Last October in Turin, the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean. We are not, fortunately, at this point. However, we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods, which the directive underlines. For example, France, the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding. We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other. Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water. The water issue will definitely not be settled today. In fact, the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects.	fr
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms. Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern. Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside. And if we are to move forward, I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side, early evidence of change of culture, empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later. And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations. Indeed, it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced. I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that. The second point that I want to make concerns information technology. Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms. On the second part of Mr Harbour' s question, he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement. Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials, which is already very strong, will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training, the allocation of responsibility, the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing. Cultures are products of structures and systems, and the structures and systems have become old. By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before. I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour. I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices. I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002, but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect. I do not use those as an excuse. We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms, these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously.	el
We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough. We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights. All of this needs to happen, and quickly too. If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise. That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available. Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary. . (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue. This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned. I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight' s debate. Firstly, although much progress has been made, and we could mention customs administration, bank administration or tax administration, it is true that we must continue to move forward. However, in moving forward, what should we be financing? This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement. In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds, for example, Amendments Nos 3 and 5. In our view, however, in both respects, greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which, on the ground, is more aware of the reality than we are. We believe that to prejudge, at the moment, where resources should be directed, would create more practical difficulties. In short, we should put our faith in those parties who, in these areas, are better equipped than us to make certain decisions. The second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges, but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors. Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate? Some of the amendments in your report pose this question. For example, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4. I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue, that this is not the fundamental problem, although we recognise it totally. The fundamental problem is that, at the moment, the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the High Level Steering Group, but it is also true that they have no legal status. This is simply a political commitment. That is the reason why, while accepting its spirit, we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources.	fr
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time. However, criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee. The reports are late, and, in addition, they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. A good opportunity to discuss the results, good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost. Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union. Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region, but, in my opinion, we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either. Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA and PHARE programmes. This coordination is at present lacking, and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it. We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible. It is of decisive importance to get local business, organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes. Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful. Projects have often remained half-finished, and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy. We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement. Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee. I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the explanatory statements, has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission' s guidelines. It will not work as an automatic target, but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions. This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds. Here, projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries. Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money, that is only for the borders within the EU. But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation. The regulation pretends that there is one, but there is not. The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time. The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded. Since 1996, Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties. Nothing has happened! The difficulties are once again being allowed to persist, to the detriment of the regions concerned. Parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation, and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners.	de
"Our experience shows that the labels would, in that way, be given greater credibility. Moreover, this system functions excellently where it has been introduced. We are therefore especially pleased that the idea of a more commercial form of organisation has been abandoned. I also think it is good that the idea of a graded eco-label has been done away with. It is easier just to have the picture of a flower. A graded system, like the one that existed originally, would probably cause more hassle than it would be worth in terms of additional information provided. We are also pleased that the proposal is to cover the service sector, too. All in all, we think that the common position and the amendments which have been submitted, including the amendments from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, make this into quite a good report. Mr President, whilst recently at my sister-in-law's house, I noticed that she had a container of ""eco-friendly"" washing-up liquid. When I congratulated her on this, she looked rather guilty and admitted that the green bottle now contained normal detergent, as the alternative product was not only more expensive but needed four times as much and even then it did not get the dishes clean; by refilling the container, she could both do the washing up effectively and impress eco-warrior friends. The moral of this story is, of course, that to compete in the mainstream market, eco-products must give a performance close to their alternatives. Only then can these products move out of the niche market they already have and into the mainstream. The eco-label should not be associated with mediocrity. The German Blue Angel and the Nordic Swan have led the way in eco-labelling. To scrap these successful schemes now would be to throw away the baby with the bath water. In the long term, I can see the merits of the single European eco-label, but this must not be imposed on those with existing schemes. A single scheme has advantages for business: for example, only one registration fee and inspection, standardised packaging, and advantages for consumers who will not be confused by a plethora of labels. Eco-labelling is moving on from forest products and detergents to computers and household appliances, but why stop there? Services such as tourism and clean taxes could register. In addition, groups of similar small business could possibly cooperate and register together. In the United Kingdom, we have a flourishing ethical financial services sector, offering savings and pensions which invest from a green perspective. These should not only qualify for an eco-label, but be allowed to sell their products without hindrance throughout the EU in a single financial services market. Mr President, first of all, I wish, of course, to thank the European Parliament' s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, in particular the two rapporteurs, Mr Schnellhardt and Mr Poggiolini, for the very constructive work which has been carried out in reviewing the regulation on eco-labelling."	el
This is not new. Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation, its effectiveness and quality have been called into question. Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror. Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally? One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy' s internal conflict. In terms of trade and agriculture, in particular, the European policy is in conflict with the development policy. We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries. This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation. We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations, but as a policy in its own right. I advocate transparent, joint and efficient development policy. As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money, it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States. Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible, so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way. Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense. As various Members have already commented, we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies, whose objectives run counter to development in those countries. And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and industry. We are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies. So there is a whole raft of contradictions. In my opinion, these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies. They are, if anything, more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States. We have to be aware of this. We often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world, as was recently the case with Indonesia, when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment. For me, these are the most serious contradictions in all this, more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies. We obviously know that, even within any one country, there are always contradictions between various policies. That is a fact of life. And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies, in this case development policy. We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them. The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one.	fr
The principle is one we strongly support but we believe it can be more effectively enforced if Member States retain the power to establish their own charging systems appropriate to their own circumstances. For example, in the UK the system by which a ship pays the waste collector each time it uses waste facilities, without the port getting involved, works well. It is based on a consensus which has been forged by all the players, including the ports and environmental groups like RSPB and the World Wildlife Fund. However, we share the rapporteur's concern that different charging systems should not lead to greater risk of maritime pollution. That is why we back the Council proposal to strengthen the review clause to ensure the impact of the directive is monitored regularly. Mr President, anyone who has witnessed the environmental consequences of the Erika disaster cannot reasonably vote against a report, the aim of which is to ensure that ship-generated waste oil is taken care of. This is an extraordinarily important report. It should be emphasised, in this context, that it is not mainly legislation that is missing. All EU countries have signed the so-called MARPOL Convention, and the Baltic countries have also signed the Helsinki Convention. The aim of both is to prevent discharges into the sea. It is a question, rather, of increasing access to port reception facilities and of creating the motivation also to use these. The Baltic is affected every year by a great many oil spills of greatly varying sizes. In Swedish waters alone, there are hundreds of these each year. The Baltic is also more vulnerable from an environmental point of view than many other seas. It is in this perspective that, with today' s decision, we are seeing the beginnings of a solution to which, in the very end, all the countries around the Baltic will contribute, including the applicant States of Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. This is, as I see it, a sphere in which we have everything to gain by cooperating across national borders. We can never in a million years solve Europe' s environmental problems alone. Finally, a word in the ear of those who, for financial reasons, are still hesitant: think what the alternative cost of cleaning up our seas would be. There will come a time when we shall be able to meet imperatives of this kind. We shall then be grateful if we have done everything in our power to prevent oil spills. Mr President, I would like to state briefly that I do not believe that anyone doubts the need for a directive to tackle this problem, which is a serious problem not only for Europe, but for all seas world-wide, and that urgent and effective measures are therefore necessary. I would like to make it clear that there is a series of principles which are universal, and with which we are therefore in complete agreement. First, every port must be equipped with the necessary facilities for the treatment of waste. Secondly, polluters must pay, naturally. I agree that there may be discrepancies in exceptions regarding the type of ship or devices for measuring the length of ships. However, what cannot happen is a battle leading to a distortion in competition between the different ports, where we find ourselves with a series of theoretically environmental measures on the protection of the coast or the sea, leading to a distortion in competition between the different ports. It is therefore on this issue that effective measures must be adopted because, if we are unable to adopt a suitable solution, then this directive will end in outright failure. And the only outcome will be that some ports are advantaged and others disadvantaged, all due to fine words on the environment leading to a competitive war between ports. The logical solution, for example, would be to establish the principle of a single tariff for all European ports, a tariff that is exactly the same, that would not give rise to any type of distortion in competition, or similar measures. Any decision that, for example, enables the Member States to grant subsidies to the different ports, would end up distorting competition and would ultimately be ineffective. Mr President, I share your love of the sea, and your love of diving and sailing, and I sincerely believe that all those present are concerned about how we can guarantee clean seas for current and future generations. I believe that the work we are discussing today is a great step forward.	fi
"Goods do flow freely from these territories, goods produced in Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. We have an international agreement and it is being transgressed. It is our responsibility to ensure that the terms of the agreement are respected and upheld by all. Under the circumstances, when Israel does not clearly discharge its duty to apply the origin rules and the territorial clause of the agreement as it should, the Commission is encouraging Member States to resort to the import verification procedures which can be dilatory and evasive. Israeli customs can be given a very long time, up to ten months, to reply to any queries and the import verification procedure can be totally unproductive. We should be requiring deposits on all goods imported from Israel until we are able to ensure that Israel will stop abusing the agreement. I have a couple of questions, Commissioner. Has the Commission received from any Member States' customs services documents certified by Israeli customs that represent specific settlement locations in the occupied territories falling within the scope of the agreement? Has it directly asked the Israeli officials responsible whether its customs service applies the territorial clause so as to exclude the occupied territories from the agreement and has it determined that Israel correctly understands and interprets that territorial clause? And is the Commission aware whether they apply that territorial clause correctly or not? Finally, the Commission has already stated that action to uphold international agreements with the EU, and I am quoting, ""does not represent a sanction against Israel but demands correct implementation of existing agreements freely entered into by the parties"" . In short, Commissioner, this is not an issue which should be treated as a matter for peace-process-related political debate. It is, in fact, an international agreement and a trade agreement. Could I just finally express my great hopes for the peace process in that area - a part of the world that so desperately needs it - so that it can re-group and re-form and help its millions of under-privileged and poverty-stricken citizens. Mr President, it is universally recognised that rules must be observed. It is also universally recognised that our partners must also be made to observe the same rules. Everyone understands that there is concern about this today, but I would not like our demand to be regarded as selectively applicable. Nor would I like our oral question to be perceived as an indictment. Our demand is not selectively applicable and the Commission should therefore regard this as a suggestion to look into the use of Community funds in regions around Israel. And because the Commission' s investigation is not, and must not be perceived as, an indictment, I should like to mention two points which are central to the balance of our approach. Firstly, anyone familiar with the region knows that the future of the Palestinian economy is intimately linked to the economic cooperation agreement with Israel. The Oslo protocol envisages an integrated customs authority to encompass both Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Anything liable to separate the two economies would have a serious effect on cooperation between Israel and Palestine, including joint ventures, Palestinian sub-contractors and exporters. Secondly, nowhere in the agreements between Israel and the European Union are the frontiers of the State of Israel defined. The negotiations in progress between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are specifically concerned with defining these frontiers. Any attempt on the part of the European Union to impose its own idea of the territorial limits of the State of Israel would be, at the very least, lacking in tact and detrimental to these talks and to the idea of the role which we feel Europe should have in this region. I support the cautious approach which the Commissioner has taken and is taking in this matter, firstly because this is not a simple issue. It is complicated; it is always difficult to determine the origin of any goods and where they come from. No less so in the Middle East because there you have a situation where there are many joint ventures between Israel and Palestinians, where produce in some cases is partly manufactured in the Palestinian area and in the State of Israel and these developments are good things, they augur well for the future because if trade is being done in this way in the Middle East, then that will be the bedrock of any peace agreement."	fi
There are probably many more questions that were asked. Let me end - I do not want to take up your time any longer - by saying that I am ready to come here whenever you want but I would prefer, if it is possible, to have sessions in which we concentrate on some topics and develop them to the fullest, because if not, we have so many topics, so many issues that it is very difficult to really treat them in depth. I am prepared to do it - you know that from me and I am really ready to do it whenever is necessary. At this very moment, I wanted to share with you one important thing. Helsinki was in December and our Prime Ministers and our Heads of State asked us to do something very important for the first time. To have capabilities and make an effort for crisis management even for the military. I am proud to tell you that two months after that we have started and we are moving in the right direction. I think that the Members of the Parliament, as representatives of our citizens should be proud of that. I am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the High Representative. I will not detain the Parliament for long but perhaps I could make one or two points and begin, which is sometimes rather dangerous in any Parliament, by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality. Mrs Pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail I think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow. I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject. I spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the NATO parliamentary assembly and Members of this Parliament. Many of you were there on that occasion and I think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a knife among many of the NATO parliamentary delegates when we spoke about Europe' s ambitions in the area of CFSP. This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well. As I said in my remarks, I felt when I was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to laugh or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the High Representative' s remarks today were extremely encouraging. We have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time, but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves, for example, facing up to difficult questions about resources. Many people will argue that of course all that is required in Europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but I suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the Member States about whether that really is enough, about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own Union. I would just like to say a word about the non-military aspects of our security policy, of conflict prevention and crisis management. Rightly, the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that.	el
Is it true that the US Government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the World Trade Organisation (for infringement of Article XI of the GATT and Article 2(2) of the Agreement on technical obstacles to trade) if it is adopted? The Commission agrees with MEPs that the current method of dumping electrical and electronic waste is causing major environmental problems. Consequently, the Commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and, since 1997, has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned. The outcome of the discussions, as well as of the in-depth investigations which are being carried out in this area, are now being examined by the Commission. Some parts of the proposal have been criticised, among them the phasing out of some heavy metals and brominated flame retardants, as well as the application of the principle of making manufacturers responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste. The United States' delegation to the European Union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper, inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned, as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers' responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste. The main argument put forward by the United States in this context is that the present provisions are, they say, incompatible with international trade law. The Commission is currently carefully reviewing the United States' arguments. I should just like to add that my intention is that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before Easter. My question specifically concerned the reaction of the US Government to the text of the preliminary draft. There have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one, to my knowledge, dating from July 1999. Is this the text which you will be submitting, or an amendment to the original version? Version 3 is already much weaker than Version 2 following the comments of US industry as relayed by the US Government. I note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible, you are referring in fact to the rules of the World Trade Organisation. The arguments of the US Government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the WTO rules. This worries me because this means that, when adopting texts, we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the World Trade Organisation. This will fundamentally weaken European environmental legislation and particularly this proposal. Thank you for the follow-up question. It is important for me to have a chance to answer it. It is clear that in a process such as this, where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe, there is an on-going dialogue between the different parties concerned. The dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal. Parts of it have been strengthened, but other parts may well contain too many compromises. We are still in the process of preparing a text, and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment. I do not think that the intervention of the United States should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations. I strongly oppose using the WTO and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the EU from introducing radical environmental standards. I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these. However, I do want to listen to all the points of view. For example, I recently met representatives of the electronics industry who put forward suggestions - including practical ones - for improving our own proposal. However, I totally reject any suggestion that I would allow the United States to determine the shape of our directive. In fact, I believe that we should be showing the way, an intention that will also characterise the final proposal. Question No 42 by (H-0026/00): Subject: Gender and environment Practically all the contributors involved in the Rio and Kyoto processes - individual organisations, civic action groups, governments, the World Bank, the UN and relief organisations - believed that women should take a greater part in decision-making on the environment.	fi
"You mentioned the Council. That is why we must overcome this problem. But I do not believe that we can solve the problem by paying fees for fishing quotas under a new agreement with Greenland. That is no way to solve the problem. We must draw a distinction. ""Yes"" to sharing out non-utilised quotas and a mechanism for doing so, but we should not start introducing licence fees where we do not have to pay for the quotas. There is little point in doing that in our view. Question No 51 by (H-0195/00): Subject: Compatibility of special export aid with Community law Following the devastation caused by the storm which struck western Europe in December 1999, the forestry sector is in a particularly serious plight. In response to the urgent need for stocks of fallen timber to be disposed of, the French Government has, amongst other measures, decided to grant 50 French francs per tonne in order to subsidise the transportation of timber intended for export to other EU Member States. Under the Community's competition rules (and, in particular, the Community preference requirement), such aid is rightly prohibited except when it is intended to remedy a situation which may be regarded as exceptional. Hence, Article 92(2)(b) of the EC Treaty states that 'aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences' shall be compatible with the common market. Is the export aid which has been made available by the French Government compatible with Article 92? If so, could such aid be extended to cover timber exports to third countries? If so, what are the criteria used by the Commission in order to determine the amount of timber eligible for such aid? For how long will the aid be available and what is the cost involved? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, the Commission had dealings with the French Government over the state aid that France wishes to grant the forestry industry for the purpose of repairing the tremendous damage caused by the storms of December last year. The notification from the French Government includes a measure intended to facilitate the transportation of wood from the affected regions. However, the notifications make no reference whatsoever to where the wood is destined for, in particular, they do not indicate whether it is to be exported to other Member States or to third countries. Understandably, therefore, the Commission has asked the French Government for additional information. Since the Commission has not yet received all the additional information it requested, it is not in a position at this stage to give a definite answer to the question as to whether such measures are compatible with Community law. I should like to ask the Commissioner to clarify his answer. Obviously such aid is already officially provided for in the countries of the Community. Instead, the question concerns countries outside the territory of the Community, and may be expressed thus: will we, or will we not, have the possibility of obtaining a derogation in terms of the tonnage, costs or time limits with regard to wood exports, in consideration of the quite exceptional nature of this storm? My question clearly concerned exports outside the common market, outside the Union. So as to make it absolutely clear: wood is an industrial commodity under Community law and it stands to reason that export aid, of the kind for which provision is made in agriculture, for example, should not be permitted under any circumstances where the export of wood is concerned. We can only apply existing Community law in such cases. Provision is made, under Article 87 of this Community law, for damage - and I repeat, damage - which is the direct consequence of a disaster, to be made good. In other words, firstly there has to be evidence of damage, and secondly, a direct link has to be established. You must also consider the following: if we were to entertain such an idea - after all, the price of wood is not just down in the French forestry industry, for the disaster has brought it down throughout the Community - then every other Member State would be within their rights to come and ask us to approve export aid. This would be a clear distortion of the market. Question No 52 by (H-0202/00): Subject: Preventive distillation - increasing the quotas The Commission has opened preventive distillation at 10 million hectolitres for the 1999/2000 wine year."	fi
Tourism is a social, economic and cultural phenomenon which affects most European citizens, either as the recipients or the providers of a wide variety of services. Every year, nearly 200 million Europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel, usually to other countries in Europe. Moreover, Europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries, even though it faces increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products. Since the Treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real Community tourism policy, the European Union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment. Vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in Europe especially, as far as tourist service providers are concerned, in meeting multicultural demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers. Employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious, thereby hampering its sustainable development. It is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible. As the report notes, the adoption by the Member States of tax incentives for SMEs in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour-intensive sectors and, consequently, in the tourism sector. This sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions, especially the most remote and island regions, which have undisputed assets in this area. Let us not forget that, in the most remote regions, tourism is the most important industry in terms of income. The income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community. In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it makes us more aware of other European cultures and thus helps respect for European ways of life to develop. It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed rationally in the long term, should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies, while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural, cultural, historical and environmental heritage. I should like to close by stressing the essential role which the European Union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental Europeans to discover the most far-flung destinations in Europe, namely the most remote regions. Mr President, we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance. The basic document is really no more than a Commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment. Not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 April 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old.	fr
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document. And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given. We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes. Europe will press ahead with integration; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will, in the end, reunite our continent. A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission. However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present. I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully. I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union. We in the European Union are one Community. We belong together, even when there are problems. Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe. Mr President of the Commission, you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks. You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties, and that is indeed your role. For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned, we expressly respect, acknowledge and support you. (Applause) Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same: we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century, a democratic Europe which is able to act. A Europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and, at the same time, looks after its global interests with dignity, patience and convincing self-confidence. Europe' s message, the European Union' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development. Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world, which is becoming smaller and smaller, as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity. Seen in this light, globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger, more of a coming together than a segregation, more mutual enrichment than separation. But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans. Globalisation is not only an economic process, it is also a cultural process, which is why we say: we want partnership in the world, we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting, we want partnership, a meeting, exchange and peace. But we also say: we want to defend this European Community of tolerance, which is why a common foreign, security and defence policy is so important. Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today, bringing the European family a step closer together. We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process. All the countries in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity, democracy and the rule of law. For us, the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, it is not only the reform of the institutions of the European Union which will be important in the next five years; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidating the European currency in coming years. We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact. We need structural reforms in the European economy. Most importantly, we need to restore a European economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs. It would be Europe' s undoing if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium-sized businesses in Europe. (Applause) The Commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays. We too want to help put Europe on its feet. You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	fi
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks, in particular, against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where, of course, European standards of food safety do not apply. I completely understand your concerns, and I feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the European Union itself on this issue. We also have to think of the consequences, especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers. Nevertheless, as you know, this issue is now in the hands of the European Commission and it will have to take this further. The Council' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited. Mr President, I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber. But I do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field. I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency. My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level. I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role, even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States. Mr Crowley, with regard to the presidency' s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations, particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless, I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome, and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them. We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency, which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme. We have no specific, concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency. It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council' s scope for action. Any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have talked a lot about the future, about what the Commission will do, and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon, etc. However, you also said something which I find particularly frightening.	fr
"On the last page of the president' s document, I noticed the intention to set up an observatory for industrial change. I can foresee a large role for such an observatory and I would, therefore, like to see a pro-active approach to dealing with it, and I would call on UNICE, the organisation of European employers, in particular, to show more commitment and some more enthusiasm. It disturbed me that their documents for this summit mainly contain wish lists vis-√†-vis the authorities but they do not emphasise their own commitment and their role at all. In my opinion, you do not get something for nothing. Their cooperation in these activities should also be outlined. Another point which I would like to touch upon briefly is tax coordination, as I do not think I have sufficient time for three points. The presidency has mentioned the sensitive issue of company tax and has admitted that there is a considerable impasse in the Monti package regarding this issue. I would like to make another appeal for a broad analysis of the developments in the field of company tax, especially vis-√†-vis the Commission, and with regard to the Member States, I would like to suggest that such a Luxembourg process be considered because when I read the report, I can see examples of best practices which could be adopted. So I would ask that this point be given due attention too. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, there has already been a great deal of discussion, and I hope that I will not repeat any of what has gone before. I would, however, like to thank the Portuguese Presidency most heartily for the document presented and for the excellent address given by the President-in-Office of the Council. As President Guterres reminded us, it is true that we do not intend to introduce new processes in Lisbon, but rather to combine those decided upon in Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne. However, this is the first time in many years that a strategic objective has been put forward, and I feel that it is extremely important: to transform the Union into an economic area based on innovation and knowledge, in order to boost economic growth, achieve full employment in proper jobs and bring about social cohesion. Last year, the Commission carried out a study which revealed that, if we do not make radical changes to the qualification and professional training systems, by the year 2010, the skills of 80% of those currently in employment will be outdated, and this will exacerbate existing inequalities and open up new gulfs. The answer is lifelong learning and a large-scale investment in technical skills and knowledge. The amount of research - another strategic sector - which is carried out in the Member States of Europe must also increase. We must take a qualitative step forwards and move on from framework programmes to a European research area and a common research policy. This is innovation, and not just structural, technological innovation but also innovation in the field of procedures and methods. As Mr Van Lancker has already said, the ""Social Affairs"" Council must have the same status as the ECOFIN Council. Social dialogue must then be consolidated as a fundamental means of reaching a consensus on the implementation of the necessary changes. Lisbon must be remembered, not only for its excellent preparatory document, but as a Summit which, at the start of the new millennium, will mark a significant turnaround for economic growth, employment and social cohesion in Europe. - (PT) Mr President-in-Office, I would like to congratulate you on having persuaded Europe that the modernisation of the economy and social cohesion are concepts that can be mutually compatible. The preparations for the Lisbon Summit have demonstrated that people in Europe are not working hard enough and that if we want to be the most dynamic region in the world, we not only have to work harder, but we will have to do this with more information at our disposal, combined with an ability to use that information. If we are to increase the rate of employment and fund our social security systems, we will have to have a longer working life and, above all, we will have to have more and better trained women in work. We therefore hope that this Lisbon Summit will help to change the present model of female employment. I would like to ask you, Mr President, if you envisage this summit yielding conclusions which will enable specific, timetabled measures to be adopted so that there are not only more women in the world of work, but above all, in the new knowledge economy?"	fi
Lastly, I would like to stress the issue of liability. Not only in terms of maximum sums insured, which I believe should be similar to those in the United States. We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments. I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States, but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and, therefore, the liability of shipowners, and also to hold liable those who charter ships, which is to say the owners of the cargo. Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable, we will never, in my opinion, resolve these problems. I will end now. I will not expand further. We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions. But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done. As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety. The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers. Thank you very much, Commissioner. We have taken good note of your intentions. I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m. Storms in Europe The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe. Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission. Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward, particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union, in terms of the help that we can offer them. In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2. I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it. In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid. We should therefore put this situation right immediately. You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one. Let me explain. I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest. Indeed, for some 'forestry' districts, which have lost 20% of their trees, this represents a huge loss. We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more.	de
Excessive paperwork. Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control? That is a clear complaint that we get. That needs to be addressed. The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee. This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure. Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee' s work? Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words. The mission of reconnecting with the European public is critical as Mrs Morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words. I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words, but we will try to lead by example. As far as excessive paper is concerned, the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan. We detest the excess of paper, but given the requirements that we have to check and re-check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control, sometimes the requirements of administration, which some call bureaucracy, are unavoidable. In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too. We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent. One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform, the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe. I know I can rely on everyone here. That concludes Question Time. I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock. Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy. Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay. Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana. I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Thank you, Mr Poettering. Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes.	el
I worked for many years on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it was really moving to see how a nation in such difficult circumstances was reaching out for a more open, European-style, pluralistic democratic society. I fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction, towards European exclusiveness and apartheid. Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, the question which needs to be raised in Geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty. We have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in Geneva. We failed at the General Assembly last year on a fallacious pretext, I refer to article 2.7, which we are otherwise happy to adopt for all other texts. The question of the death penalty should therefore be raised at this year' s General Assembly, certainly not at the Geneva session. As Mr Patten said, and I would like to thank him for the positions which he defended, the crucial point is China. Unfortunately, the positions taken by the Commission and the Council, or at least the presidency, are more than just a hair' s breadth apart; this is serious, especially in the light of the Council' s macho position on Austria. In my view, as far as China is concerned, and knowing that the European Union' s policy towards China has been a total failure, allegedly constructive dialogue has got us nowhere or, worse, it has given the Chinese new pretexts for increasing repression and for strengthening religious repression and the repression of freedoms (as Mrs Wallstr√∂m has said with regard to the Internet) in all sectors, in Tibet, in inland Mongolia, in eastern Turkistan. There is regression in every sector of Chinese civil society. It is a fact: China is the major threat, the major threat to us, the threat which we must confront, the threat to peace. It is the antithesis of democracy and you know as well as I that the Chinese, the Chinese leadership, is Communist first and Chinese second. China likes doublespeak. Until we have a firm position, we will achieve nothing with the Chinese authorities. I think we need to seize the opportunity. We need to associate ourselves with the American initiative. We need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted. We need to work. The Fifteen need to start work right now, with all the members of the United Nations; we need, at long last, to issue a firm condemnation and then use that as a basis to gain a negotiating position. Mr President, I would like to try to put a different perspective to this. As you know, on Monday an unmanned spacecraft went into orbit around a peanut-shaped asteroid called Eros which is not very far from earth. Photographs show us that there is no life on the asteroid, but much further out in our galaxy, the Milky Way, there are about 300 billion stars, many with planets. Beyond the Milky Way there are 300 billion other galaxies with countless stars and planets.	el
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem. However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC, In my own country, mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges. There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system. The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo/French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union' s disputes resolution procedures. This has been compounded, so some who advise me believe, by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government. Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible. This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable. What is happening in France, Mr President, appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties. I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings. I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this. Mr President, on behalf of Commission President, Mr Prodi, I would like to respond as follows. The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The purport of this request is, on the one hand, to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance, such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and, on the other hand, to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance. May I add that, on behalf of the Commission, I listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas. The unease is justified. It has been said more than once: justice delayed is justice denied. The Commission sympathises with these considerations. In the light of this sympathy, I would like to continue my response as follows. As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines.	fr
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement. I have three short questions, the first being as follows. We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice. Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry, Foreign Trade, Competition and the Internal Market? I am sure that your answer to this will be ""yes"" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be? My next question, Mrs Wallstr√∂m, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example? Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation? In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached? . Thank you very much, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, for these questions. Of course, this is shared by the whole Commission. This is a common communication which was written by the three of us, David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen and myself, but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today. It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission. So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document. Yes, I would say we already use this way of working with different, difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example. And, I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle. We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas. It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health. So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it. Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence. Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power. We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for? The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists. I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority? How would you describe this? What establishes a recognised minority? If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision? The Commission? The Council? And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this? What is the role of the scientific committees? What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up? Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way? These are my three questions. . Yes, Mr President, that is true. There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions. Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers? Well, that depends on who the legislators are. This is part of risk management. They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case. However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle. It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete. That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science. It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base."	fi
Thirdly, the Military Staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries. Together with myself, this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare, with the assistance of the Military Committee, any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the European Union. This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces. Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics, not for military purposes, but with strictly humanitarian ends. We are therefore working diligently in this respect. Madam President, if, a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time, I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today, that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use, many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad. We are not mad. What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent. Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination, drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki. In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission. I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time. I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you. We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility. Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace. It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict, to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them. As you may recall, it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States. It will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days, or two months, to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year.	de
I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development. This was, as you know, one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level. Through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund, the EAGGF, this Community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas, an issue you are quite right to raise. On the other hand, the European Regional Development Fund, the ERDF, also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion, by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion. In this regard, we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas. This combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today, furthermore, is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also, have developed and changed. We think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multifunctionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy, and the EAGGF, of course, has a crucial role to play in this. Question No 9 by (H-0798/99): Subject: Farming and the Portuguese Presidency Will the Council outline the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy and indicate the steps it feels are necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sectors and products adversely affected by recent health scares? Your question on the common agricultural policy is one which we take very seriously and which should always be considered in this House' s discussions, because in the future we are likely to discuss this issue at great length. During the Portuguese Presidency, we will be continuing discussions on the CAP, by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the Union' s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers' incomes, paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family-run farms. On the other hand, the Portuguese Presidency will continue, if and when the new WTO round begins within its term of office, which is by no means guaranteed, to ensure that the presence of Community production on international markets is strengthened. It will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported Community farm products and preserving the multifunctional European agriculture to which I have just referred. The Portuguese Presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already referred to this aspect this morning. We think that the role of food safety, specifically in terms of everything linked to public health, is one of our presidency' s essential tasks. It is therefore one of the priorities of our programme. We shall be developing it in four parallel schemes, in the Agriculture Council, the Health Council, the Consumer Affairs Council and the Internal Market Council. At the Santa Maria da Feira European Council meeting in June, the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission presented in its White Paper a few days ago. We think that the task we now have of establishing a European agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market, to stabilise confidence in this market, to break down some of the tensions between Member States in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the European Union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety. This is what we shall be trying to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope, at the end of it, to be able to present the result of our efforts to this House. I thank the President-in-Office for his reply. I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the European model which is based on family farming, mainly those farmers involved in beef and sheepmeat production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs. I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks, in particular, against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where, of course, European standards of food safety do not apply.	fi
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible? Finally, will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament's rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid, as they should be, on the basis of all the work they do for us? Without them we would not be able to function. Mr President, I also rise on a point of order. Are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this Parliament, outside the doors of the Hemicycle, to ensure that MEPs are free to come into this Hemicycle to discharge their mandate? If there are such rules, who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility? Mr President, I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants, which we have always considered to be a priority, and inform you that - as the Italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo, we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the Quaestors. I think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway. I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise. Mr President, first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants. Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament. As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament. To give a non-contentious example, no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons. Following a letter I received yesterday, I immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration, probably in the near future and possibly in the next month. But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament. I signed a letter yesterday afternoon, in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament, in which the assistants were informed of this. But I am also told that they were informed verbally of this decision by the Committee of Chairmen of Groups last Thursday, so they were fully aware of the decision. There is no problem with them telling us the way they feel, there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament's next part-session. But there was some misunderstanding, for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission. But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee. As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament, whether they be about different countries or whatever. This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants. Thank you, Mrs Banotti. I think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised. Mr President, I wanted to point out an important matter of principle.	de
It is therefore the Greek Government which is my primary partner. Subsequently, if I need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised, then I will do this. I cannot do other than work with the Greek Government. I think that my colleague Mr Alavanos will be giving all these particulars to the Commissioner so that he may be aware of them, because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting Community programmes. However, turning to the substance, I should like to ask the Commissioner to bear in mind the following: that for all national and regional programmes, Greece is regarded as a region which expresses itself - at the level of its partnership relations with the European Union - via its central administration, its central government. From that point of view, neither local governments and much less non-governmental organisations, for example the farming cooperatives which would be interested in further development of the farming sector, have any involvement in the formulation of proposals for the third Community Support Framework, nor have they had any involvement in the previous CSFs. What can the Commission do about that? Mr Theonas, I can only repeat what I said to Mr Alavanos. I will monitor this situation very closely. If necessary, within and pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation, I will make comments on the use made, not of Structural Funds which are not yet committed, but of the negotiations prior to the allocation of these Structural Funds. However, I am obliged to respect the national authority with which I must conduct these negotiations. Having said this, I will look at the situation objectively. As for the rest, if you have any recommendations or suggestions on the involvement of a particular structure - I think you spoke of a cooperative structure - I am ready and willing, on the basis of suggestions from MEPs - you will be acting within your role and I within mine - to relay these suggestions, provided that they respect the spirit and letter of the Structural Funds Regulation. Why would I not say that we have noticed in previous years, on the part of the Greek Government, some shortcomings in the application of the new Regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society? I am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted, this must be remedied. I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework. Question No 45 by (H-0041/00):  Subject: Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period, 1994-1999, no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas? Can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period? What role will aid from the Structural Funds play, on the other hand, in the promotion of renewable energy? Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional, renewable energy sources?	el
"Moreover, I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy. Mrs Schroedter' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid. It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved, chiefly those involved at a local level, who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems, hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships, which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned. This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid. In order to do so, the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament, associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society. These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid. Amended again as such by the Schroedter report, they are a step in the right direction. They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006, but that is another subject. In the meantime, let us support this first step. - This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States. Although I wholeheartedly support this aim, I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether. In my mind, illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping. We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry, we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments. If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans, then we must have a level playing field. Illegal state aid, by contrast, destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment. There are, of course, cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate, for example helping companies restructure. In all such cases, however, strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained. Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry, EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law. I enthusiastically support the report's proposal to publish a ""scoreboard"" showing the amount of state aid per Member State. Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed. Member States cannot be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private. I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling. Much remains to be done, however, and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe. . (PT) The Commission' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity, given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States. Unfortunately, the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight. It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions, of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples. This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion. The truth is though, that the Commission' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives. On the other hand, it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity, and supporting the social economy and solidarity. There must also be support for rural development, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas, specifically in the field of social housing, with a view to achieving sustainable urban development."	fi
Finally, there is the absolutely crucial point about establishing emission limits in relation to air and water - whether we are talking about heavy metals or dust, ammonia, dioxin, sulphur dioxide or other hazardous substances. I think that defensible levels have been identified in this connection, and a reasonable balance has been struck between incineration plants proper and the combined plants. It is a balance that I hope will be maintained, including during the vote tomorrow here in the plenary sitting. Again in contrast to Mrs Grosset√™te, I want, moreover, to say that the levels set here for emissions are realistic. They are technologically feasible and they are, in actual fact, already being applied in a number of the Member States. The existing plants which do not at present fulfil the requirements are also to be given a good few years in which to be adapted to the new requirements laid down here. I hope therefore that, by means of the vote tomorrow, we can make our contribution to solving the health and environmental problems involved in waste incineration so that the enormous quantities of waste which we produce every single day do not cause more serious health problems or greater damage to the environment than is absolutely necessary. Mr President, Mr Blokland has carried out an enormous task. This subject is incredibly involved. Moreover, the lobbyists have been something else. I should never have believed that there were so many of them concerned about waste in Europe. You might have thought it was gold rather than waste they were talking about. One never knows, but it perhaps bodes well for the future that a recycling industry is developing which possesses such competence and power in terms of financial resources and personnel. Obviously, the EU must create a sustainable system for protecting air, land and water. This is a common commitment and a common responsibility. It clearly ought, too, to be regulated at European Union level. But is this the right level at which to produce such very detailed technical descriptions as this Directive is attempting to produce? Ought it not, rather, to be the case that decisions should be made on permitted emission levels for various substances, on the measurement systems and on how the measurements are to be carried out and that, subsequently, the principle of subsidiarity should be applied? It is true that, when it comes to the ways in which waste is dealt with and is co-incinerated using large quantities of biomass fuels, there are really quite enormous differences between northern Scandinavia (where the transport routes are also long) and the densely populated areas of Central Europe where the problem is, quite literally, more one of waste incineration and of refuse collection and disposal than of, for example, generating combined power and heat. I should like us at some point, but not now, to debate the opportunities for creating framework legislation in this area. Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mr Blokland on this report which will set Europe-wide standards for incineration, including for the first time emission standards for dioxins and furanes; this should lead to more competition between different methods of waste disposal, and as a result help bring to an end the transport of hazardous waste across Europe in search of the cheapest waste operators. With the predicted increase in incineration, it is vital that overall EU legislation on waste disposal and on air quality is consistent and comprehensive. We must look at the whole hierarchy. Incineration may increase as stricter controls are put on landfill, but it does not go hand in hand with recycling and environmentally friendly waste-disposal methods. Building new incinerators is a costly and long-term venture which in turn has to have a long-term return for the investors, so it would be in their interests for waste to continue to be burned. This means that there is a danger of over capacity which will lead to encouraging incineration for reasons of profit, rather than encouraging the reduction, recycling and safe treatment of waste, which is our goal. This Parliament must protect the health and quality of life of the people that we represent. There is no safe threshold for dioxin emissions and more research is being done on the effects of micro-particles on human health and the environment. So we have to ensure that there is frequent testing and monitoring, that regular and detailed information is made available to the public, and that real action is taken against breaches of the rules.	fi
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point. In this regard, Madam President, I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language. Last week, the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre. Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments. There can be no democracy without a living parliament. I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now. With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us, I would say that we are very much in agreement. Nevertheless, I would point out to the Commission that, as far as the Socialist Group is concerned, there has been a change of priorities. We understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda, which also includes what is known as 'quality of life' priorities, that is to say, the rights of citizens as consumers and as people, in relation to those questions which we always talk about, but never give sufficient priority to, that is, the European social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances, consumer rights, respect for the environment and sustainable development. When speaking of the commitment to full employment, we have to bear in mind that, these days, full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War, that is to say, employment for the male head of the household. We must argue for equality of the sexes, the famous 'gender mainstreaming' , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission' s programme. This means prioritising sex equality, the adaptation of the social model and, above all, an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat. This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission. It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics. I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue. In this respect I would also add another element, which is economic government, given the single currency, and I believe this is inescapable. This is another question on which the Commission must make progress. With regard to the ambitious objectives and, above all, the Commission' s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration, I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000. Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision? The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential. With regard to governance in general, I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms.	de
My group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council gave the go-ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that, in fact, a group of high-ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the Council an initial report by June 2000. However, we, the Parliament and, in particular, the group of the Social Democrats, want Lisbon to go one step further now. It is of great importance that, in our fellow MEP' s report, this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence, based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy, that is to say it should encompass common goals, guidelines, national action plans and performance evaluations. We believe that this course of action is ambitious, yet achievable. Needless to say, it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level. The financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this, and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda, and why, in fact, scenarios such as Danny Peters' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground. But this new course of action is very exciting. The employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary, for our social security systems are facing the same challenges, and in an EMU era, social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition. But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group: social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation. They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation. I think that it also a good thing if, moreover, the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001. I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group' s idea and we hope, Commissioner, that we can also count on your support. Finally, we urge the European Parliament, both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process. The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support. Mr President, the four chief objectives which the EU countries' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows: that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable; that social integration should be promoted; and that sustainable, high-quality health care should be guaranteed. These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them. Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from.	fr
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East, even though, as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki. Such is life. I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would, in all normal circumstances, wish to do. The debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis I had arranged to see visitors from the Balkans this evening. So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion. It is not something, I assure you, which I would wish to make a practice of. Like honourable Members, I welcome the United States' efforts that have relaunched the Syrian/Israeli negotiations, despite the Syrian decision that they needed more time before resuming the talks that were scheduled to start again today. There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future. I also hope that progress in the Syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of Lebanese/Israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel's relations with its northern neighbours. At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track. The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict. A fair and, indeed, generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East. Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum. Although there has been some slippage, I trust that the remaining Israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon. Similarly, despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework Agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid-February deadline, I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached. I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat, when they met on Monday. Honourable Members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track. This is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible, in close liaison with the US and Russian co-sponsors as well as the regional parties. We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development. The beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month. I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again. The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process, as all sides - Palestinians, Israelis, their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged. Nor is our role confined to that of banker. We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region. But we should not kid ourselves: a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag. The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments. We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon. But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process. We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians. We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them. The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza. European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period.	fi
In Europe, in your rapporteur' s opinion, this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years, not just once but repeatedly. Such an attitude has downside risks which I understand the ECOFIN Council is currently discussing. These risks involve a correction in the US economy and the future trend in oil prices and in long-term EU interest rates. Should any of these risks materialise in a negative fashion, what will be our response - more laissez faire or shall we have prepared ourselves better than in the last downturn? It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts. One is to adopt the Commission' s own excellent, outstanding econometric analysis, and ask the Council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected quantifiable targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible. A central plank of such a programme should be the raising of the level of investment of capital formation from 19%, to which it has fallen over the decade, to at least 23-24% of GDP, both in the private and in the public sector. To allow the public sector to take the necessary significant lead in investment policy, the Council would indeed have to sacrifice some of its most sacred cows. It would need to revise its negative attitude towards the big infrastructure programmes of trans-European networks, which have been gathering dust in the drawers for rather too long, to allow them to be financed on an adequate scale by means of European Community bonds and to accept an interpretation of the concept of budget deficits which would allow governments to borrow for purposes of investment without falling foul of the restrictions of the stability pact. This was the first pillar of my recommendation. The second pillar consisted of embracing a large number of structural reforms, privatisation, de-regulation proposals, as well as suggestions facilitating the transition to a knowledge-based economy which, as we know, constitutes the backbone of the proposals of the presidency for the Lisbon Summit. It has been repeatedly stated by expert opinion that the programme of structural reforms combined with an expansionary programme of investment and growth is capable of pulling the European economy out of its state of inertia while one-sided policies are condemned to fail. Unfortunately my colleagues of the People' s Party aided and abetted by the Liberals in the Economic Affairs Committee found my approach unacceptable. I am glad that at least after five years of insistence they have found the target of full employment acceptable but I must say that simply referring to full employment without proposing a concrete programme towards achieving the targets smacks too much of lip service and is too unconvincing to serve as the political message of optimism that people expect from us, have been expecting from us rather too long. It is certainly not my task to judge other people' s alliances but if the People' s Party and the Liberals are so desperate to cement their alliance, let them at least propose something positive, something that has a chance of working, not repeat the same tired old platitudes, ideas that have so singularly failed us in the past, nor oppose other people' s concrete efforts just for the sake of opposing them.	el
Furthermore, the Presidency' s conclusions define the four pillars which will form the future basis of the joint European policy on asylum and immigration. These pillars are: partnership with the countries of origin, a common European asylum system, fair treatment for third country nationals and more efficient management of migratory flows. I must particularly stress the need for the European Union to have a comprehensive approach to immigration which covers political aspects, human rights and development questions in the countries and regions of origin and transit. The latter involve the fight against poverty, improvement of living conditions and job opportunities, prevention of conflicts, consolidation of democratic states and respect for human rights, including those of minorities. I wish to confirm the importance which the Union and its Member States attach to absolute respect for the right to ask for asylum on the basis of a full and comprehensive application of the Geneva Convention. I must also underline the intention to develop a vigorous policy on the integration of third country nationals legally resident on EU Member State territory. Finally, although these measures are needed to guarantee social peace in our Member States, we must recognise that the fight against illegal immigration must be strengthened and the protection of the rights of the victims of the criminal networks organising such immigration must be guaranteed. Particular attention must be paid to the situation of women' s and children' s rights. I therefore share the rapporteur' s and Parliament' s concerns. The Commission asks you to note that, in response to your concerns, our concerns and the requirements of the Tampere mandate, we intend during this year to submit all the main instruments of the asylum policy to Parliament and the Council. These consist of the joint procedures, the revision of the Dublin Convention and the final Eurodac instrument. However, at the same time, the Commission intends, in the autumn, to submit to Parliament a communication on immigration policy in the European Union. We must review the 1994 communication and update the approach to the questions of immigration policy in the Union in light of the Tampere conclusions. As for the inadequacies of the legal services which have been underlined during this debate, the Commission does not intend to tackle some of these albeit very interesting theoretical and practical questions, such as the career structure of national judges or the duration of trials in several Member States. This is because we should respect the principle of subsidiarity and recognise that the basic options must be the decision of each Member State. The Commission would underline in this respect that a green paper on legal aid represents a worthwhile contribution, both to the requirement to define common rules on the protection of defendants, such as the guarantee of assistance from interpreters and translators in cross-border trials, and to the establishment of a wider programme of mutual recognition of legal decisions. As for civil justice, the communitisation of several civil justice instruments is an efficient way of ensuring the effective legal consideration of human rights. The Commission has already proposed communitising all existing conventions not currently in force, particularly the one on the service of documents and the Brussels II Convention and the convention on bankruptcies. We have also proposed making the very important Brussels Convention of 1968 on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgements in Civil and Commercial Matters into a regulation. All these instruments are currently being examined by the Council. Even the United Kingdom and Ireland have decided to join the Member States on this and Denmark, which does not have the same capacity to participate in work on civil legal cooperation, is also seeking solutions which are currently being examined. Finally, with regard to children' s and women' s rights, although these matters specifically come under the competence of Member States, I can remind the House that the Commission and I have undertaken to submit a package of measures on these questions by the end of the year. These measures will aim to go beyond the joint action of February 1997. They will consist of definitions, charges and penalties in the fight against the trade in human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation and measures against the sexual exploitation of children. Turning now to the Ludford report, I very much welcome the opportunity to respond to Parliament' s report on racism and xenophobia. The Union' s commitment to supporting fundamental rights and fighting discrimination was made very clear in the Amsterdam Treaty and this is, for me, a crucial development of the European message.	fi
As far as we are concerned, they will be. We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter. Question No 5 by (H-0785/99): Subject: Proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000, and the case of anchovies in particular The latest reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ICES zone VIII is critical. Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France (5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future? Does the Council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established TAC of 33 000 metric tonnes per year, given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks? What measures does the Council intend to adopt, and when, with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks, the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability? Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question, particularly because it broaches an issue which concerns Portugal in a positive way, and I shall explain how. The Council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refers. Nevertheless, at the last Fisheries Council of 1999, held on 16 and 17 December, the Member States involved in this area of fishing, namely France, Spain and Portugal, considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes, as the Commission proposed, was excessively cautious. A compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks, that is the species of fish being affected, and the socio-economic problems caused by fishing limits. This was achieved by fixing the TAC at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999. It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species, of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year. As for the Southern stocks of anchovy in ICES zone IX, the TAC was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999. Fishing quota transfers between Portugal and France were reduced proportionally from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000, for fishing in French waters. I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall, over the whole Community fishing area. In accordance with the principle of relative stability, 90% of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10% to France.	de
That is my judgement at the moment. It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery. Colleagues, I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda. I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents. If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important, I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them. On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner, and his statement. As you can see, half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session. I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions. That concludes the debate. Question Time (Commission) The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission. We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time. We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session. Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion. I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda. That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda. The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m., and you can see the clock. I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event. First Part Question No 28 by (H-0781/99): Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atat√ºrk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes. Turkey's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan. What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	fr
The treatment of the Native Americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights. The account of the Dineh Indians is telling. With the discovery and, certainly, the exploitation of black gold - and, later on, uranium and oil - all possible means were used to remove these people from their land and to send them to regions with few prospects other than poverty, hardship and contamination. The area in Arizona which is to be the New Land for the Dineh Indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in US history. It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land. The fight of these Indians is being backed by more than 250 NGOs and, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian 'Mother Earth' organisation, we are being kept informed of this situation. This too is characteristic of American society, which hears little about it. They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents, but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country. Today, the Dineh Indians are facing their final fight for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, for their right to their way of life. There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful, economic adversary. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers, but I would like to emphasise a few things. The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians. They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years. They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years. The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries. The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples. This relocation is, of course, unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic, social and cultural terms. The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and, in that way, lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their forefathers - but also any prospect of work and sources of income. The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry. Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives. The population was not allowed any input. This resembles a kind of trade in human beings. The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium. After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world' s most contaminated areas.	fr
I have two questions. Firstly, you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission. Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well, that is to say via the television and Internet? My second question is of a critical nature. The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency. If I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands, then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model, and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands. My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this. Mrs Maij-Weggen, given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC, it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now. The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible. The documents will in the main be open working documents. Although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media, I am committed, as I must be at this stage, to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission' s viewpoint. I can confirm, and thank you for having asked me about this, that we will use all the most modern means, television in particular, to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe. We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums. The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised. These are the modern means to be used. However, I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people. Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal, I want a Commissioner, when he can, an MEP, a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe. I have evidence that this is possible. The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions. Although this may seem rather egotistical, I want the Commission, in the minds of the people, to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible. Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say. I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire, a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding. He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner. I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign?	fr
One of the most significant transfers - the Tajo-Segura transfer - which has been in use for many years, almost 30 years, has an allowance of 658 hm3 per year. The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200. We cannot be accused of bad management. Is the Commissioner aware that, of this 263 hm3, we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the Levante, 30 for water supplies in the area of the J√∫car, 7 for supplies in the southern area of the J√∫car and the rest in the Segura, equally divided between supplies and irrigation? We are not doing a bad job of management. We cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it. I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies, because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive. Take good note: in this diverse Europe, which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation, we have to find diverse solutions, not single solutions. I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council and this House so that, when voting, they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required. Commissioner, Andalusia is not Lapland. . (SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, of course, to begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she has put into the present framework water directive. Water is one of our most important natural resources, as many speakers have already said. An ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe. Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office. I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament. Many of them are based upon the very constructive, informal discussions which have taken place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading. Most of Parliament' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious. The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle. Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary. With a view to these forthcoming negotiations, I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position. Firstly, I should like to mention some of my most important arguments. We now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention. Rather than make these objectives legally binding, we must consider their political nature. This is also reflected in many of Parliament' s amendments. Where water charges are concerned, the present directive will constitute Europe' s water policy for the next three decades. It is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost-effective way.	de
"- (NL) We have consented to the Haarder report but would like to make the following observations regarding paragraphs 19 and 20 of the draft report. Paragraph 19 urges Belgium to sign the Convention for national minorities. Flanders does not seek to prevent Belgium from ratifying this Convention for national minorities, but it would like to add the proviso that this should be done outside the Belgian constitutional context. In the Belgian federation, the federal states are equal pursuant to the rules in the constitution. Not one of them constitutes an actual minority. Because the Convention does not clearly define the term ""national minority"" , according to Flanders, it does not apply to the periphery. For Flanders, ""national minority"" in such a context can only refer to a minority which has been established within a certain area for centuries, whilst the French-speakers only moved to the periphery some three centuries ago and have since refused to integrate, which is to be expected in the normal course of events (compare this with the Flemish migration to Wallonia and their perfectly integrated descendants). Moreover, French-speakers living in the periphery, which boasts the language facilities, can count on protection, which is mostly unavailable to real minorities. So, whoever tries to change the situation in the Brussels periphery using this convention will implicitly put the future of the Belgian constitutional equilibrium at risk and illustrate once again that a European lack of insight into our federal system can lead one to think that we would be better off as the separate Member States of Flanders and Wallonia, rather than as a federal Member State of Belgium. Without a doubt, French-speaking Belgian MEPs will again use this vote to play political games in Belgium. We do not wish to participate in this and would emphatically disassociate ourselves from this kind of practice. Moreover, we regret that in paragraph 5 of the Ludford report, the same text was adopted for racism and xenophobia. In the same light, Flanders would like to make it clear that the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, as referred to in paragraph 20 of the Haarder report, does not pertain to French in the periphery but, for example, to the Limburg dialect (recognised in the application of this Charter in the Netherlands) or to the Arel German dialect in the Province of Luxembourg. - (IT) Quite apart from the approval or rejection of amendments and the removal or amendment of paragraphs, we were disgusted to find in an annual report of the European Parliament on such a sensitive and urgent matter as human rights, the recommendation ""not to imprison child abusers, except as a last resort"" , and a call for the Member States to ""lower the age-of-consent for homosexual relations"" . We must fight against pornography, against increasingly widespread child abuse, against male and female prostitution and against sex tourism, which inevitably leads to suffering on the part of children. We must fight against discrimination and psychological and other forms of abuse in the spheres of work, information, politics and the family, which is again at the centre of the debate at a time when children are being transformed into mere objects to satisfy the egotism of those who, having relinquished all other values, are attempting to satisfy their egos and their desire to possess with ""technological"" motherhood or fatherhood."	el
"Surely thousands of people killed, thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough. My second country - I will be brief as Mr Patten knows this country very well - is Burma. Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma. I have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion. For ten years now, the elected President of that country has been under house arrest. And for ten years now, its parliament has been out of action. Numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma. There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention. In my opinion, Burma should be put back on the agenda, too, certainly in the wake of Indonesia' s U-turn. Surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch, even by Europe. My request is, in fact, to put this country back on the top of the agenda. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, economic clout cannot be the only factor that determines the European Union' s status in the world. One of the EU' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights, as exercised both within the Union and by our partners. The European Parliament has been at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human rights, and it has succeeded in overcoming the limits imposed by self-interest and ""national interests"" , which are sometimes reflected in the positions adopted by the Member States and even by other European Union institutions. We can therefore safely say, for example, that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten, which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people, who always opposed occupation by Indonesia. By the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia, a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account. But it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position. It is vital that when violations are committed, the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity, whoever or wherever they may be - in Indonesia or Angola, in Cuba, China or Burma, whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers, humble foot-soldier or general or even a minister. Justice needs to be done in Indonesia. Justice needs to be done in East Timor. President Wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with. The specific reference in this resolution to East Timor, on the initiative of the PPE Group, is a timely one. Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there, some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House; they cannot go unpunished."	fr
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not. Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway. We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent. The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question. Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport. As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end. The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day. In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety. In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves. Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster. Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved. Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport. This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport. But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission. As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.	fr
I want to say Madame President some words to Mr Sch√ºssel. Mr Sch√ºssel is a man with an honourable record in European politics. He now intends to ride into government on the back of a political tiger. Mr Sch√ºssel - you are assuming a very serious, personal, national and European responsibility. That responsibility, which you Mr Sch√ºssel now take on, is to respect the letter and the spirit of the European Treaties. Finally, Madame President, this is a debate which touches on the heart of our democratic values and institutions and calls to mind that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. On this continent, of all places, with the experience of hateful racism that we have suffered from in the past and at such great cost, we have to insist that today' s debate is not about interference with the sovereign rights of a State. It is a dogged insistence by the democratically elected part of the institutions of this Union that we will not as Europeans countenance turning the clock back. (Loud applause) Madam President, we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the Union, so that we can uphold them together. Instead, we have been forced to debate the formal, substantial errors that have been made in the last few days. We are astonished by the political naivety of people who, with thoughtless words, have bolstered Mr Haider' s position in Austria and made the Union look ridiculous, riding roughshod over Article 7 of the Treaty by announcing unconstitutional measures. We have never before seen such serious, clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a Member State. Of course, we cannot violate the founding values of Europe, and in this regard, the Italian Prime Minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty: he mentioned the Treaty of Copenhagen, which I, like you, have never heard of because it does not exist. Maybe he was referring to the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 6 of which lists certain principles and Article 7 certain procedures, in order to establish that a Member State is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in Article 6. However, up till now, Austria has committed no serious or persistent violation. Apart from amounting to interference, the statement by the Presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for. No political cohesion has so far come about, not even in the fight against organised crime, or in defence of the victims of genocide; we do not have a currency that is even remotely stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty; but it only took one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union' s credibility. Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated, but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government. Otherwise, how will we deal with Communist countries which return to Communism: will we throw them out of the Union too if Communists enter into government, or will Stalin' s grandchildren be forgiven for everything? (Applause from the right) It is via diplomacy, persuasion, knowledge, and solidarity, and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles. Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this. This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions. So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region. However, we already knew this. However, today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union' s democratic role. We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples, and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights.	fi
B√∂ge report (A5-0023/2000) . (FR) As an MEP and, more importantly, as a consumer, I welcome the European Commission' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union. This proposal has two objectives: first, to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and, secondly, to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species. What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie. What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis. I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs. These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie. A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic. Even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective, especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie, it is still a notable improvement. It is a pledge to European citizens, who have voiced their concern, as regards European food policy, on many occasions. The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard. As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution, traceability, responsibility and transparency, the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety. This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence. It is up to us, as responsible Europeans, to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive. Cederschi√∂ld report (A5-0008/2000) Mr President, I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament. In my view, products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products, namely, those that can be seen and touched. The fruits of the intellect and science, which are intangible, are of inestimable importance. Therefore, the European Community should be more energetic in providing practical encouragement, not just through upholding patents but through concessions and other forms of support for scientists who are striving, through the knowledge and experience they have acquired, to give future generations something better than that which they have today. . (DA) We oppose, on principle, the European Community' s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the Member States.	de
"Coherence, consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures. One is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system, another is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that those standards are set and supervised, and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service.  I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very strong assurances. There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General. If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control, the ex ante system can be used. Naturally, there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage. Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system, it most certainly can be used. Lastly on transition, I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called ""soft law"" . We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call ""hard law"" . But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council. There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper. In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances. The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition. Two other points I must make, because this is an essential question central to reform. The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia."	fr
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality, which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry.  Mr President, once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive, and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange. These amendments actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives. The Council' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all, or a significant part, of the costs of recovery and recycling. But, as Mr Lange so rightly said, this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers. Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry, I can tell you that it is not possible, retroactively, to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road, i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe. This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs. The common position puts European car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market. Of course, we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby. We are here to build a Europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive. This is why, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange. These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints, since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States, and some of them work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate. Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector. Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive. Cars are also part of our cultural heritage. I think we would all agree on that. Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force. Parliament' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic. The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling. The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road.	de
I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything, but I must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers. Mr R√ºbig has the floor. Mr President, fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions on another Member State, because a democratically elected government was formed there. Both parties were once part of the government. So far there have been no infringements of the law. Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights? Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council, in respect of the formation of national governments, be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights? Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights? Mr R√ºbig, as President-in-Office, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union was adopted bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union. Nevertheless, I would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States was actually a set of actions of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level. We feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which, although it has become part of a European Union government, does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the Union' s aims. I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency, because my government intervened at the request of, and in conjunction with, fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity. Mr President, I have the honour of being a member of the Convention drafting the Charter so I am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the Convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force. What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up? Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document? Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter? - (PT) The answer is neither yes nor no. I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council. Question No 8 by (H-0042/00): Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits. These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects. Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process? The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.	de
Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event. We must now get down to adopting measures, Commissioner. Firstly, efficient controls are needed in Community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport, particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved. The construction of these vessels, the use of double hulls, their age, their control by classification companies, insurance, the creation of databases containing all relevant information, Community cooperation and coordination, the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled. Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for European harmonisation in these areas? Flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport, particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling 'responsible fisheries' . Access into Community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards must be controlled. We expect concrete action from the European Commission. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of Brittany and the Vend√©e are particularly important, well-developed and prestigious. The European Commission must therefore publicise the damage caused and its assessment of this damage. It must also indicate all the specific measures, including political, economic, social and financial measures, which it intends to adopt in order to minimise the damage and compensate the fishermen and industries which have been dramatically affected overnight. How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained? How can those affected be compensated? This is a very serious problem which the European Union, as an economic, commercial, industrial and fishing power, must tackle. We must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and occupations. We must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future. This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries. We hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission, with plenty of action and no more regrets. This House will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups. Mr President, the shipwreck of the Erika off the coast of Brittany on 12 December caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years. In addition to destroying natural resources, this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors, particularly those dependent on fisheries. With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel, the situation could still deteriorate. The consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming ashore. These consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself. The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance. They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which, unfortunately, is not an isolated event. The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature, which is nowadays too often being punished by man' s activities. These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities. Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes. Surely the budget would agree, as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these. Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked. Yet on the issue of the Erika he has given the impression, perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vend√©e, that, as the Fisheries Commissioner, he is not always available or, at best, available only on a part-time basis.	fi
"This sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency. That position is like holey cheese, or to keep it the sphere of water, as leaky as a sieve. It explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment: nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading. This is unusual, but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes. The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak. The chemical industry and, unfortunately, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance. This is very time-consuming, and, more importantly, there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances. Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable. This is what is meant by the term ""close-to-zero"" . The Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances, many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect. These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause, even in extremely minimal quantities, changes in the gender of animals and even humans, as is more and more being ascertained by scientists. This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020. I would like to mention two substances from the Commission' s list: mercury and tributyl, abbreviated to TBT. On the bottom of the Wadden Sea, the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value, to wit, ten and one thousand times, respectively. The chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes, and if this is impossible, to apply them in closed systems. For the substance TBT, this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance. A sound alternative would be to clean the ship' s sides mechanically. I would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substances by the year 2020. Mr President, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive. The Council's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas. Therefore, our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete. As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals. Firstly, we think that the time-frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the Council. We therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive. Secondly, I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently. There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented."	el
The second principle in the Council' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive. It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product. To do so also changes the owner' s liability retroactively. Over the years, a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways. Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scrapping of cars. Some may be better than others, and some worse. In anticipation of this EU directive' s being implemented, EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation is not applied. This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds. Mr President, everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question. The common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement, and puts the whole directive at risk. I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument. I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive; the costs are not excessive: recycling a car costs less than 1% of the price of a new car. Moreover, the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until 2006, when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market. As for the remaining vehicles, we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs, as is proposed in Amendments Nos 44 and 45 by Mr Lange, the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries, and we should therefore support them. Mr President, this is an extremely bad directive. First of all, as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out, it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle. Secondly, it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment. In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment. I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect, which has not been examined well enough in this debate. It is like so much European legislation. It is far too prescriptive. It sets in stone one particular model of recycling. The production line was invented about a hundred years ago, I believe, by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles, to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them. One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars. The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so. There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars, recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts.	de
He is a parliamentarian of considerable skill, and he has argued his case throughout with force and conviction. But he undervalues his own contribution to this debate, because it is what he has done and others have done that have led us to a position which can be fairly regarded as a compromise. Those who deny that and say that we are still in the position of total obstruction, are really admitting - as those are who wish in the vote tomorrow to reject the common position - that they do not want this directive at all. They do not want to see the addition of vegetable fats anywhere, in any Member State, in any form, for anything called chocolate. That is not a position which either the majority of the Member States or the majority of consumers in the European Union would accept for one minute, and I want to use my brief time to argue the contrary case. If we move on from harmonisation at nought-percent vegetable fat, which has always been in the campaigning argument, we move to a position where we ask for safeguards for consumers, for the primary producers, and essentially for the standards that we set ourselves in the European Union. The amendments that came before the Environment Committee, with the exception of the few that were passed, were wrecking amendments. They were designed to postpone, for the lifetime of this Parliament and the lifetime of this Commission, any resolution of this issue, and that is not acceptable. They called for impact studies to come into force before the directive itself can take effect or all manner of additional labelling over and beyond the double labelling on the packet which is provided here for the consumers. My Group supports the common position with some exceptions, and they will all make themselves heard in this debate. We believe that this is good for consumers. They get a wider choice of product and separate and distinctive labelling. It is good for the manufacturers of all the vegetable fats and I include cocoa butter in this. Cocoa butter is the predominant component of all forms of chocolate, as it will continue to be, also for those who have produced the natural vegetable fats, a specific list which can only be altered with the advice and consent of this Parliament. If I came from Burkina Faso or Mali or one of the countries that produced beurre de karit√© and I was told that the women' s cooperatives who collect the shea nuts that are a substantial part of their exports to Europe, will be banned or put at risk because they are seen to be stooges of the multinationals, I would be very angry indeed. The last point that I have time to make is to the producers of quality chocolate by the specialised methods we see in Belgium and some other areas. Quality argues for itself. You can have additional labelling if you want. People like me will continue to eat it, but we want people to have the widest choice of all the products which will expand the import of cocoa and added vegetable fats into the European Union. Mr President, the average citizen who hears about this debate on the chocolate directive will lick their lips at the thought of feasting on all kinds of delicacies. After all, chocolate is also considered a stimulant, unfortunately. Even as a new member of this Parliament, I am feeling the strain of the lengthy discussions on this topic and I cannot shake off the impression that chocolate has generated anything but a pleasurable experience in this Parliament. This agony will come to an end today. There are many interested parties in this discussion: the cocoa producers, the producers of vegetable fats, non-governmental organisations, chocolate producers and many more. They are all interesting in their own way, but most interesting of all is the consumer, in my opinion. The most important principle is that of the consumer' s freedom of choice. We politicians need to show some prudence in this respect. After all, there is no accounting for taste. The European Parliament cannot and should not prescribe a harmonised euro taste. As far as we are concerned, there is no need for warnings in flashing neon letters on the front of chocolate packaging. After all, chocolate is not exactly a product like cigarettes. There are, of course, other interests which need to be taken into consideration. For example, we need to be aware of the precarious situation of the countries where the ingredients for chocolate originate.	fi
We are debating nothing less than the presence in a Member State' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the Union enshrined in its founding Treaties. A simple reading of chapter 4, article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder. The view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others, as is written here, revives old ghosts of the century which we have just left behind, which some historians have described as the century of horrors; horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Haider' s manifesto has stirred up once again, to our amazement. Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State. However, that is not the problem. The question is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party. Our answer to this crucial question is no. Leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations, leaving aside possible exonerations based on other people' s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests, the Spanish delegation of the People' s Group of this Parliament, in full agreement with the Spanish People' s Party and the Spanish Government, clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 January by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council. We agree with its substance, its tone and its scope. (Applause) Konrad Adenauer once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the surest way to pacify a tiger was to allow it to devour you. History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided. Therefore, Madam President, the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message, rejecting of the tiger of intolerance, xenophobia and totalitarianism, so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications, renunciations and opportunism which mark Europe' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price. (Loud applause) Madam President, the European Union was built upon the idea 'never again' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia, concentration camps, anti-Semitism, heightened nationalism or war. The one and only significance of the European Union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de gr√¢ce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe, and which is still highly topical today. It is not true to say that, when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe, this is merely a question of national sovereignty. For this Union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances. It is a Community that is destined to exist, in which, when the main thing is under threat, when values are under threat, all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again.	el
"Unfortunately, I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking. This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on. I am convinced that the Bible, God' s word, is the only pure source of proper standards and real values. In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by: the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010? Have you already included your second term of office? But seriously. As it enlarges, the Union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation. First, streamlining. What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning. The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy. In other words, a social, ecologically-orientated market, a secure currency, guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally. It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important. Secondly, the new ""in"" word is flexibility. However, increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation. We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States. That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society, which is a welcome step. Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers. (Applause) Transparency does not mean more access to more paper; to our citizens, transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg, when and with what right. That is transparency. Thirdly, the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly. Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join, but by how many countries it can accommodate. (Applause) If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union, then it must not be paid. It is too high a price, not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union. There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone. But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies. That goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new, better quality of life. Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together. In doing so, we need, no less, to reinvent the European Union, but without destroying the present Union. (Applause) Madam President, in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement."	de
In parallel, it can benefit from substantial financial support via the PHARE programme. However, the EU' s present policy in the Balkans is fragmentary, inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature. There are different types of agreements or relations or lack of relations - going even as far as the embargo on Yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach. There is no sense of regionality for the Balkans, which would include everyone without exceptions or vindictiveness. Finally, intervention by the European Union to solve the problem of FYROM' s name - which is unfortunately becoming a long drawn out problem and could make an already tense situation even more fraught - and to respond more energetically towards negotiating FYROM' s principles within a reasonable time scale, is necessary and useful. . (FR) The Commission' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the Community would appear to respond to a primary concern: a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south-east Europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the Second World War. Having been crushed beneath the heel of triumphant Communism, this region has not stopped paying the price for the collapse of the Soviet system since the beginning of the 1990s. And yet, under these difficult conditions, especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO, some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community. In this sense, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case. Exemplary because it proves that the Balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the European Union in stability and association agreements. Symbolic because it reflects well on the Fifteen' s project to see the birth of a policy which is common to the five countries in the region (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM and Albania) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement. The UEN Group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states. A satisfactory solution cannot be found in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion. The Union is simply doing its job when it seeks through its cooperation policy to encourage nations to espouse a platform of common values with it, of which democracy and civil liberty are the cornerstone. It is not its job to subrogate to people in their choices or, failing that, reinvent a new variation on a 'sense of history' which perceives self-determination as a one-way street.	fr
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want, but we need to be careful about the approach we take, so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. Madam President, I strongly refute any statement, demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism. I passionately defend Europe' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law. I disagree, however, for this very reason, with the senseless actions taken by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen States. This is not the way to fight extremism. It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good. The torrent of confusion and rash actions that has been unleashed over Austria has blown things out of all proportion. It has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and evokes risks that had previously not even been considered. There is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law, but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the Austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law, in this case the standards laid down in the Treaties. What are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an Intergovernmental Conference? A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14, or even fewer? We support Europe, a Europe which does honour to all the actions that have brought us to this point, a Europe which respects the Treaties and the law and a Europe which needs Austria. This needs to be said! Madam President, I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has, by an enormous majority, condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider' s Freedom Party. Mr Haider has demonstrated, over the past years by both words and deeds, that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse. Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler, praised the Waffen SS, and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma, but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government. He has led efforts to end provision for Austria' s Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrants. Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics. They are wrong. European Union Treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights. Some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections. However, democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy. There is the tragic monument of the Holocaust, the death of 6 million Jews, to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s. However, we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition. Leopards do not change their spots. The real culprits are Austria' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945.	de
In this context, it is important for those of us who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be as Commissioner Patten said, namely a state subject to public control, and that it should be a democratic state. This is something to which we all want to contribute. Mr President, I would like to refer, firstly and above all, to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate. My Group has made a contribution to this resolution and, needless to say, approves of it. More specifically, however, I would like to express our delight at the fact that, after such a long time, Israel and Syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion. The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East. It is, therefore, regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being. Indeed, both parties will need to make huge efforts. Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders, as well as Syria' s integrity. It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue. In addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria, I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that, in the framework of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach will appear possible. Nevertheless, it is still regrettable that the European Union, one of the most important financial donors, is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process. This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the European Union' s common foreign and security policy. This is where Mr Solana, the High Representative to the Council, could come into his own. The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region. I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation. In this respect, we support Libya' s participation, provided that it recognises human rights, renounces support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process. There are still, needless to say, many unresolved problems and unanswered questions, also involving the Palestinians. Everyone knows that the peace process is a protracted and difficult affair but we are convinced that, with the necessary trust, perseverance and indispensable political will, our common goal, namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East, will be achieved. Mr President, it is pleasing that, despite certain delays and problems, the peace negotiations are going on both between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and Syria. The moment of truth is approaching. Is Israel prepared to comply with the UN' s resolutions and, in exchange for peace and security, hand back the Arab areas which were conquered in 1967? Will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation? Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan? Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and, therefore, reliable as a partner in peace? Will Syria fully accept Israel' s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law? The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country, Israel, does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility. Peace in the Middle East concerns us all, however. It is therefore good that the EU should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state. Against this background, I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler' s extermination of the Jews is being held, which is obviously a welcome initiative. Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world, not one of them, however, is an Arab state included in the EU' s Barcelona process. This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Nazis' anti-Semitism, which of course is completely incorrect. The Arab world' s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as, for example, Algeria' s fight for freedom against France. But today, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel.	fi
Madam President, even to a slightly unprejudiced eye, there is clearly no trace of racism down the broad middle of this House. Even if we disagree on a report on racism, the reasons lie not in racism in Parliament but in the report itself. For example, the report not only contains laudable words on the fight against racism; it also deals with matters such as the voting rights of third country nationals in specific countries or the right to hold public office, which may be decided one way or the other, but which have nothing whatsoever to do with racism. And it is precisely on these points that this report is a dishonest and sorry effort and I make no bones about the fact. The fight against racism, to which we are all committed, is turned into small political currency and abused, which is why we are unable to vote for the report in its present form. I stand firmly against the way in which racism has been played down, as we have said, to make it a subject of political debate. That is our grave criticism of the approach taken in this report. We are all against racism and we all have a contribution to make. There should be a broad consensus on this in this House. But we cannot possibly allow this concept to be taken up by one side of the House and used to conduct a political fight; we must insist that matters of this sort are dealt with in a way which can meet with everyone' s approval, and that is not the case here. Madam President, I congratulate the four rapporteurs on their work, and in particular Baroness Ludford for carrying forward work that I, amongst others, helped to initiate nearly a decade and a half ago with the first Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Fascism in Europe, whose rapporteur, in fact, was an excellent member of the Christian Democrat Group and of Nea Dimokratia, Dimitrios Evregenis, of whose work Mr Le Pen has said that he will use all means possible to prevent its being put into practice. I wish to make two comments with respect to the reports in front of us; one on the Belder report, which contains a version of an amendment which I have tabled concerning the treatment of the Russian-speaking minorities in Estonia and Latvia. I believe it has a place here. What was happening 15 years ago in Austria was that Mr Haider was actually persecuting the Slovene-speaking minority there. Very few of us wanted to stand up and say anything at the time. We need to tell the Estonians and the Latvians that, if they continue that treatment, their prospects of joining the European Union will be that much less. Secondly, the Ludford report has a series of amendments tabled by the Christian Democrats challenging a series of paragraphs that were originally in the Evregenis report 15 years ago - and were approved by the Christian Democrats then - on the amendment of the Staff Regulations to allow ethnic minority members to join the European Community staff. On voting rights, on the selection of ethnic minority candidates, what I do not understand is whether they have no institutional memory or whether, a more sinister development, their political position has changed. Madam President, both I and my Group enthusiastically support Mr Haarder' s human rights report because we have found a very good line in it and there are numerous reasons for doing so. My Group and I do, however, have serious reservations about the Ludford report because numerous political measures are discussed under the banner of the fight against racism and xenophobia which have nothing to do with the analysis and which, of course, have lost nothing by being in this report alongside a wealth of other measures which we shall wholeheartedly support. Allow me to tell you which points we do not accept and why. They are the points which fall outside the stated report period of 1997/98. And when Sarah Ludford says the report refers to the year 2000, then she must be clairvoyant because it has only just begun. Secondly, we are against all the points which fly in the face of the basic principle of solidarity.	fi
"I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group. Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning. It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time. We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice. These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things. No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances. This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation. However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that. In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system. Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response. Many thanks for this. This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today. The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best. The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money. Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members. During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more. What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision. Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner? First of all, the port-state control, according to which 25% of all ships require inspection. I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place. So this 25% should be increased. Furthermore, if a ship is no longer seaworthy, not only should the facts be examined, but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used. But this is not in place. Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area. Finally, as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned, some Members have already mentioned just now that, since 1999 in the United States, ships should in any case be double-hulled. In my opinion, we should look further into this point, and I also think that the Marpol Treaty, which comes into effect in 2001, should be looked at very closely. Mr President, I would like to take a brief, critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to, and admiration for, the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals. Mr President, we have already had this discussion so many times in the past. We have achieved nothing so far, and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union. That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today, and what the Commissioner has announced here, actually leads to legislation being produced; in other words, if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers: ""you must push this through in the Council of Ministers"" . Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe, which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods."	fi
Mrs Rothe, I would put it this way: I am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind. I do not have confirmation of this at present, and nor do I expect it, since we have not yet held direct talks. These will take place at a later date. The framework conditions have changed in that the Helsinki decisions made a whole range of things possible that were not possible hitherto, and, above all, in that the political strategies employed by the parties concerned have changed beyond recognition. I have always believed that the old line - i.e. not to admit Cyprus under any circumstances until the political conflict has been resolved - has a weak point in that it does not provide the Turkish community on Cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves, for, with this strategy, the Turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait. There would then be no question of Cyprus acceding to the Union. As matters stand, Turkey has to take seriously the fact that there is a risk of Cyprus being integrated into the European Union, and this would provide opportunities for prosperity and security for the Greek community whilst the Turkish community, whose level of prosperity is already far lower, would fall even further behind. Therefore, it is my firm belief that, since Helsinki, there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict. Indeed that was the idea behind it. After only a few weeks, Mrs Rothe, it is still too early to deliver a verdict on this, but in any case, I have no grounds for assuming that the new line will fail. As yet, we have no grounds for saying that we will actually succeed, but one thing I can say quite clearly is that the conditions that need to be in place for us to take a step forwards have improved considerably. Finally, of course, the Cyprus question has a role in the discussions with Turkey. I met the Turkish Foreign Minister in Brussels a few weeks ago and naturally I asked if Turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue. I would just make one point: we cannot be 100% sure - I am not at any rate - that one only has to press a button in Ankara to set the wheels in motion in Cyprus. It is very far from being that simple, rather we are going to have to make concentrated efforts, during talks with both communities, to encourage them to reach an understanding. That is what we intend to do: the necessary measures and programmes are in place. I must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation, the one that has yet to be decided on here, before we can even get started. The financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus. I cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place, because I lack the legal basis for doing so. If the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point, then I am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that.	fr
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now. . (SV) Thank you, Mrs Sch√∂rling. These are two important questions, and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them. No, one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals. When, on the other hand, the decision has been made to take a certain measure, the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness. It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis. The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof. It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases. I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this. There, however, we are concerned with that particular area, whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern. Therefore, the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context. Instead, it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this. It is, however, perfectly correct that, when it comes, for example, to chemicals, we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof. Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work, otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible. I will give an example: a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. It is therefore a teratogenic substance. Very well, it is a fungicide, it kills off mould. This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory, perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests. Now, in my opinion, given that this is such a serious risk to health, the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market, which New Zealand has done, for example. So I want to put this question to you. When human health is at stake, or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected, should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis? The cost of a baby being born blind is too high; there are no benefits that can compensate for this. In short, Commissioner, I would therefore like to know whether in this case, the precautionary principle as you understand it, would in any case, require the product to be taken off the market, until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary. . (SV) Mr President, no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people' s health and the environment.	fr
"Mr President, as far as the second reading is concerned, the Commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by Parliament. The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it. (The President declared the common position approved (as amended)) Report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (COM(1999)0158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) Report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 (COM(1999)0344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Sixth Periodic Report on the Social and Economic Situation and Development of the Regions of the European Union (SEC(1999)0066 - C5-0120/1999 - 1999/2123(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (A5-0069/1999) by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (COM(1999)0101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (A5-0078/1999) by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy (1998) (SEC(1999)0743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (A5-0087/1999) by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors (COM(1999)148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (A5-0073/1999) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code) (COM(1999)94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Own resources . (FR) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources. The European budget is effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP, especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy, which had already been cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences. Since then, Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP, the taxable basis for the fourth resource, have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources. Since then, of course, this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is, but which it refuses to see itself as. This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us. It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources, the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission. Furthermore, the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States. This is a long way from offshoots such as the ""Community criminal code"" , the ""European Public Prosecutor"" or a European police force, with OLAF. There is as yet no federal European tax. All the same, a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income, if not on profits, or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025. Koch Report (A5-0105/1999) - (FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods. In recent years, the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably, increasing the risk of accidents. Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation. It therefore proved necessary, in the context of establishing the internal market, to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention. Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement. Firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged, quite rightly, to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention, whether road, rail or inland waterway transport is involved. In order to facilitate achieving this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training. This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation, regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport."	fi
I would like to raise a few issues from our perspective. As far as the prosperity of the citizens of the Union is concerned the most important task is to try to maintain sustainable economic growth in the area, all the time seeing to it that there is an increase in regional equality with respect to prosperity and that more and more people are able to earn a satisfactory income from their work without having to resort to social benefits. The processes which have been put in place, by common agreement, to improve levels of employment, boost economic renewal and increase social cohesion within the territory of the Union are extremely important. It is only right that the meeting in Lisbon at the end of the month should stop to consider where we are exactly. Despite the diverse nature of these processes, they must have one common purpose: to improve people' s quality of life in the Union. We do not need new organisations, new working parties or new fora to achieve this objective, however. The tools are surely known to all. Often, however, national considerations, and sometimes ideological resistance also, mean that these tools do not get used. The most important task now is to remove the barriers to creating a real European home market as quickly as possible, instead of continuing to manoeuvre, in many sectors, within a framework of fifteen separate home markets. When the idea of the single market was launched with some vigour in the 1980s, we could still move towards our destination at the speed of a local steam locomotive, figuratively speaking. Now, with the rapid advent of electronic commerce, and with the speed at which we process and utilise transfers of data reaching new levels, we need to move at Mika H√§kkinen Formula 1 speed at the very least. We must, however, be sure that the engine does not give out before the decision makers get to the finishing line. How can we imagine being able to create the world' s most competitive economic area unless we venture to free up competition within the area? The opening up of competition that has already been agreed for the telecommunications industry, as with the energy sector also, will create new, much-needed jobs and bring down prices for both industry and consumers. Similarly, removing restrictions for small and middle-sized industries - whether they have to do with complex bureaucratic procedures, the acquisition of venture capital or questions of taxation - is a vital step on the path to improved competitiveness and prosperity. Global competitiveness also includes the notion of a reasonable level of tax harmonisation and the modernisation of our social system so that at least the countries in the Union with high rates of taxation can reduce those rates, which restrict employment. A basis for all this is created through education and training, and research, however. It is quite right to strive to create an information infrastructure quickly, which private individuals, schools and businesses can all as easily be a part of at reasonable or even no expense.	el
We cannot be satisfied with just this, however, as, after this target has been met, there will still be too many areas where pollution counts exceed levels that are dangerous to people and nature. Owing to this, I have recommended in my report a long-term goal, in addition to the interim one, and a final target for 2020. In that way, we would finally be able to reach a point where critical levels and loads are not exceeded and everyone will be protected effectively from all known health effects of air pollution. In this connection I would like to draw your attention to my amendment, in which, owing to a translation error, there is a wrong word in your copy of the document. In place of 'reached' it should say 'exceeded' . I hope that this will be sorted out before tomorrow' s vote. How, then, do we achieve a situation in which air pollution does not exceed tolerance levels for humans and for nature? The Commission' s proposal sets limit values for each Member State with regard to certain kinds of interrelated emissions, which cause acidification, increased ozone in the inner atmosphere and soil eutrophication. Dealing with these problems and the emissions that cause them together has proved to be the most cost-effective way of tackling the causes of air pollution and bringing it under control. The biggest disagreements in the implementation of the directive relate to the limit values, i.e., the emission ceiling set for each country. The UN Economic Commission for Europe has also examined the objectives for reductions in the same sources of emissions as in the proposal for a directive now under discussion, and, as a result of these talks, the so-called Gothenburg Protocol was signed. There is a clear difference between this proposal and the Commission' s. If we were to accept the ceilings in the Gothenburg Protocol, we would never reach the targets that the Union has set itself regarding air pollution. Comparing the differences between the Gothenburg Protocol and the Commission' s proposal with regard to the effects on health, the annual reduction levels proposed by the Commission would save the lives of as many as four thousand people a year in Europe. Although it is beyond dispute that the ambitious targets set for the environment have been found to be an essential ingredient in people' s health and safety, there have been pleas for lower ceilings, on the basis that cleaner air costs too much for industry and communities. It has to be said, however, that there is very considerable exaggeration with regard to the costs involved. If, on the other hand, we calculate the benefits that better air quality will bring to people and the natural environment, as well as to buildings, we see that the economic benefits are four times greater than the costs. We still have to work on the proposal for the directive so that, for example, the situation with regard to the applicant countries and those questions too that relate to the EU' s neighbouring regions can be better taken into account.	el
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union' s institutional bodies. I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows. My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement. Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union' s institutions. Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public. In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference. At the same time, however, I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform, I repeat, of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health, energy, culture, transport and even tourism. Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end. All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference. This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union' s Member States. In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament' s backing. The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us. Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki. It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union' s institutions. In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary.	fr
This, ladies and gentlemen, could be the decade of Europe. Indeed, I would say that this must be the decade of Europe. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate. We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document. And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given. We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes. Europe will press ahead with integration; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will, in the end, reunite our continent. A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission. However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present. I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully. I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union. We in the European Union are one Community. We belong together, even when there are problems. Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe. Mr President of the Commission, you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks. You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties, and that is indeed your role. For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned, we expressly respect, acknowledge and support you. (Applause) Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same: we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century, a democratic Europe which is able to act. A Europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and, at the same time, looks after its global interests with dignity, patience and convincing self-confidence. Europe' s message, the European Union' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development. Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world, which is becoming smaller and smaller, as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity. Seen in this light, globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger, more of a coming together than a segregation, more mutual enrichment than separation. But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans. Globalisation is not only an economic process, it is also a cultural process, which is why we say: we want partnership in the world, we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting, we want partnership, a meeting, exchange and peace.	fr
"It must be a dynamic one and one that can penetrate the reality of the situation at all levels. We cannot go about correcting obvious wrongdoings by merely resorting to rhetorical commitment. The Finnish writer Samuli Paronen wrote: ""big crimes need many accomplices, millions - all those who do nothing"" . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think these reports speak for themselves. Racism and antisemitism are on the increase in the European Union and beyond. Our first act must therefore be not only to refuse to accept this situation but to publicly denounce it. Due to its clear-sightedness, Mrs Ludford' s report actively contributes to this approach. Denouncing racism, including racist talk, does not mean censoring the freedom of opinion as some would have us believe. Racism is not an opinion. It is a crime against human dignity. It is antisocial behaviour which can include physical attacks on individuals. This has recently been seen in El Ejido in Spain and it also happened with the attacks on the homes of Turkish workers in Rostock and with the death of young Ibrahim Ali who was killed in Marseilles in 1995 by billposters of the French National Front. On each occasion, people were given the ideological arms to carry out the attacks. There is also another type of racism which involves daily harassment and humiliation. This can be seen in the discrimination applied in access to housing, leisure facilities and employment. You will all be aware of the example, recently reported in the French press, of a young man from Strasbourg who sent two completely identical curricula vit√¶ to the same company. The name on one was foreign-sounding and the other was typically French. You can guess which 'applicant' was invited for interview. We cannot nowadays simply defend those described as minorities. Instead we must get them out of this ghetto. Rather than concentrating on protecting minorities, we should be building the concept of European citizenship involving common values. We should be concentrating on building a common future for everyone and a society in which everyone can develop and which totally rejects any hint of submission to barbarism. Throughout its history Europe has been capable of the best and the worst. The best is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Convention. The worst is colonialism, the Shoah, Stalinism and nazism. We must teach our children about all of this. We must clearly embrace everything which can strengthen Europe and reject anything which weakens it. At the same time we must send a clear message about the type of society we want to build. I will say plainly that those who regard as acceptable an alliance with extremists in order to win elections will be swept up and dumped in the dustbins of history. An alliance with the likes of Haider or Le Pen is like supping with the devil. You need a long spoon which will never be long enough. I would also remind those who advocate an ethnic concept of the nation that Cl√©menceau said that patriotism is the love of one' s country whereas nationalism is the hatred of others."	el
We have to consider in particular the future creation and maintenance of resources in promising sectors in terms of employment. These are obviously information technology, electronic commerce, tourism, and, for example, services for the elderly, as our populations are undeniably ageing all the time. There are two issues that must be emphasised both by us and the Commission and the Council, and we must always draw attention to them. These tasks are still mainly the responsibility of the Member States - whether it is the issue of education and training, and research, increased competition or removing barriers to entrepreneurship. Coordination is natural in many sectors - within the framework of the tasks of the Union also - to avoid overlapping, but healthy, honest competition is still more important than coordination, including in many non-commercial sectors. Benchmarking and best practice, which the Commission recommends, calls for a large measure of Europe-wide transparency in those fields where industrial secrecy does not apply. The Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats would like to emphasise that its ambition is to develop a social, or, as they say these days, an eco-social market economy, which takes account of the welfare of all sections of society, as well as the environment. In the achievement of our goal we wish to stress the importance of the European model of society, and, at the same time, the notion that it cannot be a rigid, stagnant system, one based on advantages gained in society, but it must be one that develops as society changes. The modernisation of the European social model and its increased effectiveness are as important for our competitiveness as the corresponding modernisation of the economy. Work must be the most sensible way of improving the welfare of families, but if it really is not possible, we have in place society' s safety net to prevent exclusion. A certain change in working methods is in danger of becoming a social problem for the positive development of human relations: telecommunications, the Internet, the terminals at which we work, and television, which already seems like a venerable, ancient medium, are threatening to give the relationship between man and machine a key role in society. The most important issue, however, is developing mature interpersonal relationships in the family, at work, in society and in international relations. As the importance of education is being stressed we have to make our youth aware of that early on in their development. The Commission refers, appropriately in my opinion, to deficits that hinder the growth of employment in the Union. We might mention the skills deficit as one example. In a Union that has fifteen million unemployed there is now a shortage of labour to the tune of around one million workers in industries that are suffering from a skills deficit. Some are suggesting importing a trained elite into the Union area. I would ask whether this would be fair to countries less developed than ours, as this would create a brain drain for them. The UN, on the other hand, has referred to the fact that in a few years' time there will be a shortfall of 40 million workers as a result of demographic change.	el
"Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created. And so long as people do not have equality before the law, this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded. In our enlargement process in the EU we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities. We must not waiver in that commitment. But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies. Yes, conventions have been signed, but action is needed. I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices, eternal vigilance, not just outside our borders but within. That is why I would welcome an annual Member State report from each individual state which would have to record any charges against it and the action taken. Because what happens in each Member State happens to every single one of us. What happens in another part of the world affects us. Pinochet in Chile is as relevant as Haider in Austria. Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked. Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are connected to our development policies, our economic policies, our home affairs policies, indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions. I would repeat what Mr Patten said: we must engage, we must inform, educate and thereby effect real and lasting change. Mr President, ""Europe stands for ideals, values and principles. We must emphasise Europe' s spiritual history. Together, we must re-establish the values which unite Europe. Spiritual values have been disseminated from Europe throughout the globe. We must live with our consciences."" These were the words spoken three hours ago in this Chamber by the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel. In an extraordinarily edifying speech, characterised by wisdom, historical knowledge, an understanding of the human heart and insight into Europe' s spiritual and Christian heritage, he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity. We should be grateful that there are Heads of State like Vaclav Havel in our Europe. I wish to discuss two matters. First of all, civil society. Vaclav Havel stated that, in Eastern Europe, the Communist regimes methodically destroyed civil society: national movements, churches and the independent trade unions. The same is happening in China in connection with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches. It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet. We must never forget to defend civil society. I also want to mention the death penalty. Like my own country, Sweden, the EU bases its view of human beings upon the equal, unique and inviolable value of every human. On the basis of this principle, human beings should always have the chance to redeem themselves. Try telling that to the governments of the United States, Russia and China. Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, I believe the approach of EU Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situations in Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and China."	fr
And how right they are, for this detailed, mandatory charter, which would give standardised definitions of citizens' rights for the whole of Europe, would impose a rigid legal framework enclosing each nation in regulations which were not entirely its own. There are three reasons for our claiming that the charter, as envisaged, would curtail the rights of citizens. Firstly, on the pretext of defending citizens better, it would distance them from the place where their rights are defined. It would weaken the control that they currently have over it. It would end in a situation where a nation could no longer amend the rights of its own citizens without obtaining the agreement of fourteen other nations, a suffocating formula, ill-suited to the nature and the interests of Europe, as I explained in the minority opinion appended to the report. Next, the charter would provide a new pretext for the frenzied standardisation of citizens' rights in Europe. Indeed I am astounded that governments are prepared to allow this to happen. Have they not learnt the lessons of the past? Do they really wish, taking the example of the French Government, to have to face twenty problems such as the case of the hunters all at the same time? Finally, this charter would tend to circumvent the rights of communities, primarily the national community, which are rights that are extremely dear to the citizens, since it is within this circle that the most realistic and most legitimate democracy is expressed. Here we are at the heart of what we have called the process of reducing rights. This process would, moreover, go much farther than one might think, for a whole series of beggars and minorities have started to come out of the woodwork, clearly understanding that if the charter is standardised and binding, as well as adopted under the dubious conditions of so-called European democracy, it may in years to come represent the weak link in the chain of democracy. The Union for a Europe of Nations Group therefore considers that the charter, if it must exist, should be extremely brief and should present only the essential values, the fundamental principles of the countries of Europe, in the form of a political declaration. It is perfectly feasible to imagine, as of the end of the year, candidate countries signing up to this charter in order to demonstrate their inclusion in the circle of European values. If so, adhesion to the charter could be shared by both existing members and future members. One thing is certain, Madam President, at all costs we must avoid foisting a standardised and binding text on the nations of Europe, lest we create the post-national society which Mr Duff has just been hoping and praying for. This would be perceived as an attack on national democracies' freedom of choice. Every country must continue to be able to choose its regulations freely in accordance with its own culture and development. We would like the Intergovernmental Conference, which is just starting, to keep the essential principle of respect for national democracies continually in mind. Madam President, on behalf of the Lega Nord, for which I am a representative to this House, I would like to express my delight at the fact that the European Charter of Fundamental Rights is, at last, being drawn up.	el
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty, as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached, on average, 23.7% in the regions worst affected, regions which also happen to be poor areas, whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment, corresponding to the richer areas, unemployment stands at just 4%. Given this situation, the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment: measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes, which are often misspent, with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems, with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks, which are due in 2007. There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries' agriculture and fisheries, which are often harmed by the European Union' s own insensitive policies, as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs, particularly for women and young people. Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects. Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berend' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore. The overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation, boosting equality of opportunity, increasing the sustainability of employment and development, are only mentioned in passing. This attitude appears to me to be unjustified. I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report. This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness, particularly as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region, that is in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises. It is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regions, that is to say job creation measures, special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business. They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities. Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development, simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions. After all, the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all. Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer. And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and, to a lesser extent, in rationalisation. It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas. The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions. In other words, what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there. For example, these would be measures for vocational training, for further education, for re-integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process, for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements, in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again. Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report. The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union. By stimulating a diversity of investments, the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment. From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect. The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase, not really a satisfying result over a period during which, certainly over the past couple of years, there has been economic growth.	fi
The Union is simply doing its job when it seeks through its cooperation policy to encourage nations to espouse a platform of common values with it, of which democracy and civil liberty are the cornerstone. It is not its job to subrogate to people in their choices or, failing that, reinvent a new variation on a 'sense of history' which perceives self-determination as a one-way street. The Community construction only makes sense if it creates positive discriminations alone, and the UEN Group hopes that this signal to FYROM and specific action in its wake will help us make a sustainable contribution to the development and peaceful coexistence of the nation states in this fully-paid up part of Europe. Frassoni Report (A5-0021/2000) . (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs Monica Frassoni' s report, according to which the European Parliament is to accept the agreement entered into with the Commission about the implementing provisions for the Council' s decision of 28 June 1999 concerning comitology. In all matters, we attach importance to the fact that there should be the greatest possible transparency in connection with the decision-making procedures involved in EU cooperation, for example with a view to guaranteeing the necessary democratic control. Through the agreement, the European Parliament will automatically be sent the relevant material in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under Article 251 of the Treaty. We should also like to see this arrangement extended to other areas in which, following the agreement, the European Parliament' s relevant committees will be sent material when they ask for it. With the approval of this agreement, we have not achieved the final goal of transparency and democratic control where the comitology procedures are concerned. However, it constitutes real progress in the right direction, which is something we do not wish to obstruct. (The sitting was suspended at 1.23 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) Company restructuring in Europe The next item is the Commission statement - Company restructuring in Europe. . Mr President, industrial change, which can be gradual or sudden, is driven by new technologies, worldwide competition or consumer preferences. It has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion, but it also provides major new opportunities when anticipated, prepared for and managed. The acceleration of technological progress and the increasing competitive pressure of globalising markets are pushing companies to rapidly adapt their production and company structures. Companies must be able to anticipate and identify at an early stage what they need to do to ensure the continuity of their activities. Sometimes this calls for mergers of activities. The Commission is acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult times of change. We are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis. We have had in the recent past different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large-scale operations of corporate restructuring, often affecting the lives of large numbers of European people. In some cases these operations were prepared well in advance, fully involving workers' representatives, with due care being taken to search for the least damaging solutions. Where necessary, workers likely to be affected were prepared through employability measures to face the challenge of sudden unemployment. In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected. On every occasion, and as recently as last October in this House, the Commission has highlighted the following basic positions. Firstly, decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management. This means that, when contemplating actions likely to lead to serious social consequences, job losses for example, companies should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution. Secondly, when dismissals prove to be inevitable, the utmost must be done to reinforce the employability of those concerned.	fi
It seems to be becoming a permanent phenomenon in the region. We have condemned the Russian action over the recent months in five separate resolutions. There has been a certain amount of one-sided thinking in them here and there, which has not made them any more effective. For example, the idea to use the TACIS programme as a sanction will only lead to ordinary people suffering and has not deterred the Russian government in their policy. The extension of the war and terrorism is a major threat to us all. For that reason, we need a Caucasus peace conference, because these problems are not confined to Chechnya. Secondly, the human rights situation is intolerable, and we therefore need a proper investigation into violations of human rights by all parties. In addition, speedy and unhindered access to the area on the part of relief organisations must be guaranteed once and for all. Thirdly, the war must be stopped and talks begun. And fourthly, Russia' s active participation in the work against international terrorism and the illegal arms trade is essential. Finally, the principal rule with respect to refugees is that they should be helped near to where they live and helped to return to their homes. We should be reminded, however - so as not to be too sanctimonious in all of this - that when Chechen refugees turned to us for help we did not receive them in our own countries as we did on such a large scale with Kosovo. In this we recognise the short-sightedness of our own policies. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know that Russia' s international standing has been seriously damaged by the Chechen war. A full investigation of human rights violations involving international observers is also in Russia' s political interests. Except that the Russian government does not appear to be totally convinced of the fact. How else are we to interpret the fact that the UN envoy Mary Robinson was not granted access to Grozny and the filtration camps. The agreement which has now been brokered with Mr Kalamanov by the human rights envoy of the Council of Europe, Gil Robles, is a step in the right direction. But it will only continue to be credible if the two Council of Europe envoys really can work independently and move freely and independently around the country. We reject and shall not accept any unilateral interpretation of the agreement by the Russian government. If it should come to the point that the Russian government fails to keep to this agreement, the Member States of the European Union must bring intergovernmental proceedings against Russia before the European Court of Human Rights and ensure that there is an international investigation of the human rights violations, and I cannot but support Mr Paasilinna. We too are required to put a halt to the expulsion of refugees in our countries, as the German government has done. We too are required to grant Chechens political asylum in our countries. It would make a great deal of sense if the proposals by the German government were adopted by all the Member States. Mr President, although this does not mean that I approve of the policy of the Chechen nationalist leaders, I wish to say on behalf of my colleagues and myself, that we are disgusted at the vile deeds the Russian army has committed in Chechnya. This is a despicable war, whose prime victims are the people of Chechnya, but also the young Russian soldiers. We are also appalled, however, at the attitude of the western powers, in particular the European ones. The British Prime Minister' s recent visit to Moscow, the way he toadied to the butcher-in-chief Putin, reflect the general attitude of the western powers. What public opinion sees is a few declarations condemning certain aspects of the war in Chechnya; what we are actually seeing is political and financial support for the Kremlin. Any western loans that have not been hijacked by the Yeltsin clan can thus be spent on pursuing the war against Chechnya. Many of the parties represented here in Parliament form part of governments that are pursuing this policy of conciliation and support. Under those circumstances, the vote in Parliament can only serve as a fig-leaf for the hypocrisy of the European big powers and their profound complicity with the crimes the Russian leaders have committed in Chechnya. Freedom of the press in Serbia: The people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are still living in terrible conditions, battered by their own government' s policy of homicide and suicide, NATO shelling and the embargoes of the international community.	fi
Mr President, Commissioner, reforming the directive on annual inspections of commercial vehicles is both urgent and vital. The rapporteur has adopted a perfectly good position in this issue, in the final analysis. Drivers of commercial vehicles run up thousands of kilometres every year, and the roadworthiness of the vehicles cannot be monitored adequately by means of mere annual inspections. Roadside spot checks are also necessary because heavy goods vehicles from non-member countries often enter the area of the Union in bad condition, presenting a serious risk to safety. The newly reviewed directive will do a lot to improve road safety if its provisions are complied with properly and penalties can be imposed for breaches, penalties that are effective, along the right lines and which will serve as a warning. The directive will be more efficacious if the Member States can negotiate a harmonised system of penalties. This should not, however, slow down the prompt implementation of the directive. Justification for the prompt reform of the directive is provided by something that happened recently in Finland. The police and the vehicle inspection authorities were conducting a spot check of sixty-two heavy goods vehicles in eastern Finland recently. The drivers of thirty-three of them received fines, and sixteen received a warning. Three vehicles were prohibited from continuing their journey. Only thirteen were in fully acceptable condition. A considerable number of the vehicles in bad condition were from non-member countries. The worst case was a Polish truck with no brakes in the drawing vehicle, a poorly secured load, and a trailer whose brakes were badly leaking. Everyone can imagine what sort of safety hazard such a lorry would be on roads covered in snow and ice. Our group supports Amendment No 3 and hopes the new version of the directive will come into force promptly. Mr President, Commissioners, many complimentary phrases have been used to describe this directive and I would like to thank Mr Piecyk, but because some developments are of an interim nature, I would like to add a few comments. After the directive was discussed in the Commission, I recently asked the Commissioner about non-EU drivers driving within the EU and making use of the way people, drivers, in particular, are inspected during the technical inspections of cars. What is happening in effect is the following: drivers who do not have an employment permit in an EU Member State and who do not have a work contract in the third country benefit from the situation in that they drive a car which is registered in a particular country and which subsequently passes all inspections without a hitch, but do so outside the country where they are registered and where they carry out their activities. It is precisely in those countries that employment permits and work contracts are not checked up on. In other words, I would like to argue against directly including this option in the directive, but I would at any rate recommend further exploration of this option as a secondary matter in order to find a solution to this problem. Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, safety on our roads is of great concern to us all. Given the ever increasing volume of traffic on Europe's roads I am at pains to emphasise the need for vehicles to meet the highest possible technical roadworthiness standards, but also the need to take environmental aspects into account. Although - and I should like to say this most emphatically - it is also necessary, if the directive is not only to pay lip service to these ideals, for it to be applied by the Member States and invested with appropriate penalties. The best directive will be ineffective in everyday life if it does not provide any penalties for non-compliance or violations. I therefore support the amendments providing for guilty parties to be punished, because the operation of motor vehicles, which in principle presents a risk and entails a potential danger to people, must be supervised properly and with the necessary care and expertise. In any case we must prevent this from being dealt with thoughtlessly, precisely because this is about a directive which provides for rules not only for heavy goods vehicles but also for commercial vehicles carrying people. Time and again we are all severely shaken when there are major accidents which are due purely to technical defects. Because of this I am glad that the report is not actually controversial and that Parliament is once again proving to be the driving force in the debate about traffic safety on Europe's roads. My particular thanks go to all those who work with such dedication in this field in the committee, in the Commission and in the Council.	fi
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report. I also fully endorse his findings, in which, in particular, he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service. In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve. However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here. For example, I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance, if applicable, and making this a final competence, in those spheres where benches of the Court, which resemble courts, pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law. I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level. It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions. We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind. Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance. In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance. On a final note, I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law. As things stand, OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases. It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court. The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance. That would be another way of spurring the reform process on. Mr President, I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work. The European Union is a system based on law. It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law. Furthermore, if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them, what happens, as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, is that justice delayed becomes, as we know, justice denied. The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem. However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC,	de
If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred. This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability. Well, if the charterer is exonerated, then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for. The regulations must therefore be reviewed, and I thank you, Commissioner, for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations. Moreover, as you said, monitoring must above all be stepped up: that of the flag state, that of the classification societies. You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission. What are the conditions for this recognition? What guarantees are there of its reliability? You are going to commission a fact-finding mission. We await the outcome with great interest. Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up. There is a Paris Memorandum in existence, let me remind you, which stipulates a minimum for inspection, that is, one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned. This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries. Why not? What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw? I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for, in this case, the oil company. If the charterer' s liability entails a financial commitment, then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent. Finally, we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States. Firstly, I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team. This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area. Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster. I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes. Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year. How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it? How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds?	fr
If these amendments are adopted, I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues. So far, we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now, if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted, we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe. What is more, if we reduce manufacturers' liability on this issue, this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas, for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computers and other electronic equipment. I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers' liability. We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result. Mr President, this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars, encourage recycling, and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled. Now who should pay the costs? Whatever system is adopted, ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer. The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars. The manufacturers have tricked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals. Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers! If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments. Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is not a technical debate, contrary to what we may think. It has become eminently political. Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate. Today, if 314 Members of Parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers, we should be doing ourselves dishonour. In expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicles, as Amendment No 38 stipulates, even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer, Parliament would, for the first time, not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of Europe, it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies. We cannot accept this. It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas. It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position, whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough. The free recovery system, for example, for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly. Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council' s common position definitely must not be amended. It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable. Mr President, like so many others here today, I believe this is a good measure. This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need. Most of the technical issues have been resolved. There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved. We have arrived at the final question. In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament. That is quite simply: Who pays? The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost, not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said. In fact perhaps as little, the lawyers tell us, as 20% or one-fifth of the cost. That is not unreasonable. If you look at the UK consumer for example, who buys a Rover, as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars, over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should they pay? They have paid already. Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers, pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from?	fi
We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms, these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously. I would like everything to happen much more quickly. It is better to do it absolutely properly. Madam President, we admire Mr Kinnock' s vision and sense of realism. For he is holding up visions of a well-oiled and effective administration and is, at the same time, drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated. Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities. We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first. I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities, because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise. Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context. I would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace, it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board. We must resolutely switch from our present, rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace. Could Mr Kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the Council and Parliament to come up with for these priorities? I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House. Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out. We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities, not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have. One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union. One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect. Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism. Since I was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised, I may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our mechanistic view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the Union and its enlargement. I hope that, in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament, not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way, but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union.	de
We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring. The most important parts of Parliament' s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle. The new definition in Amendment No 72 is, however, too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose. I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution. Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater. The proposal cannot therefore be approved. The Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality. Instead, we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with Article 11 to promote activities in this area. The good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled. This part of Amendment No 41 cannot, therefore, be approved. The Commission appreciates Parliament' s efforts to guarantee that the so-called combined approach is given a central role. This approach and its scope, which the Commission can in principle approve, are defined by Amendments Nos 22 and 47. In order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality, we wish, however, to reformulate Amendment No 47 and to add a de minimis provision. The transfer of water is already covered by controls, but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer. These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can, therefore, be approved. It is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted. The proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned. These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 cannot, therefore, be approved. The Commission approves Amendment No 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal. To summarise, the Commission is able to approve 72 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle. The following amendments cannot be approved: 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 71, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 90, 91, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 103, 106 and 107. Finally, I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views. Important progress has been made, and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions. A number of obstacles remain, but I am convinced that, as the legislative work progresses, we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of. Parliament' s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious, European water policy for the next three decades. I would like to hear the Commissioner's view on Amendment No 45.	fr
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage. The result is 30% growth, so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result. Of course, it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes. I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot. Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas. A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds, and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind. Fortunately, I am on the Committee on Regional Policy. So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention. I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because, if it happens to be cancelled, then surely this does not benefit the citizen. I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect. However, I do think that it is necessary, as he always states too, that, in the next IGC, changes will be made to codecision, when unanimity will no longer be necessary. We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made: no more mega-projects, room for cultural networks, and sufficient attention to promoting reading, translating and translation companies. This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000. All that remains for me to say is: time to get down to business. Madam President, all that I wanted to say has been covered by those fellow Members who spoke before me and I think there is unanimity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture. I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart. Not because our delegation, our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding' s attitude - I think that, given the framework she was operating in, her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council. It is shameful! That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union! When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, pioneering activities in the arts, writers, to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign, something opposed, contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro, not just enlargement, nor geostrategic expedients, but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end.	de
The Commission' s communication, which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November, is a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union. We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets, which is a problem for many Member States. If reforms are not got under way, we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security. It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda. In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression social convergence. As liberals, we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies. It is not, therefore, about harmonisation but about common objectives. It is, of course, a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy. We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and, in spite of there being many points of similarity, there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned. It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern. National policy is, of course, subject to a number of common parameters. That is the case with minimum social entitlements, which are established by treaty. It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation. So coordination and cooperation are facts of life. But convergence should be about goals, not means. I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report. I can support the report, but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste. I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems, if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient, or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries. I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly, and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold.	fr
This question is very important and I would like to know - since this is a kind of 'baby fraud' - whether the Commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the Andalusians, so that the funds which the European Union are going to pay to Andalusia, based on the census, will take into account these 400 000 children which Aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services. Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matters. I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are differing viewpoints. I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government. You may answer the question. Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I hear that you have a strong voice. I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me. I have given you my answer. I am keen that the Structural Funds, particularly those in Objective 1, are allocated where needed. We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive. I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country. I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation. It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible. I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today. As I did not have an answer, I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December. I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it. I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and, in this case, passionate intervention. I would like to remind all of you that Spain is about to hold elections, and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections. It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time, since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again. I do believe it is important to say that Andalusia is going to receive 50% more within the Community support framework and that Spain also holds the record for the use of the Structural Funds, which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different Community support frameworks. Lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question: Do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable? This is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related. Having said this, we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union.	de
Now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception, and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at. The requirements propose to allow the authorities access to the facilities of all service providers, that is, telephones, mobile phones, Internet, etc.; and given the current extremely shoddy drafting, this is open to abuse. I would also like to ask: given that the user requirements specify that the police has access to all service providers without exception, does this include Parliament' s in-house service? Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very, very shoddy grounds? Furthermore, in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences. This leaves it wide open to abuse. Again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof, something which is recognised in international, fundamental law, the presumption of innocence is essential. That is not guaranteed. Neither the preamble nor the body of the text takes proper account of the rights of the defence, a basic principle of international fundamental rights. This issue is extremely serious. We are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout Europe which are extremely concerned about these developments. Mr President, I am neither a member of the Legal Affairs Committee nor a lawyer, but like almost all of us, I understand the need for this Single Economic Area of Europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom, security and justice. In that sense, the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important. What did I understand on reading the related texts? That it is dangerous to rely on the provisions made by the Council. The many contradictions and conflicting views over what Europe is and the many different legal systems could not only lead to confusion and inefficiency but also create dangerous situations. For example, the situation proposed by Article 18, to which many speakers have drawn attention, where each country, each large country if you will, each country with the technical ability, can enter another country and monitor its telecommunications without even securing the second country' s approval. In my opinion, the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur Mr Di Pietro have produced some very interesting work. It is a pity that this very well constructed explanatory statement by Mr Di Pietro could not be conveyed in the telegrammatic five minutes he had here today. Nevertheless, it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries, defendants and citizens, a path which I think must be pursued much more completely and much more boldly. I should like, however, to draw your attention to the fact that all this is taking place in a framework in which there is confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law. A child, a student or a pupil who smokes hashish in one country is dealt with in an educational way, while in another country he is treated as a criminal and locked up in the universities of crime constituted by the corrective system and the prisons.	de
Due to the existence of these borders, they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong. This has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy. This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990. This programme was designed to encourage cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union. INTERREG serves principally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs, education and training, cultural exchanges, action to combat health problems, the protection and improvement of the environment, energy, transport and telecommunications networks. I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration. More active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be promoted, bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border. In cross-border cooperation, greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators. In the same respect, given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50% of all unemployment, the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment. Obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing, braking or hindering cross-border mobility. I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region! INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area. Finally, and in particular, expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTERREG! The challenges are therefore immense. The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy! I hope everyone, like Mr Decourri√®re, whom I congratulate, will realise this! - (FR) The INTERREG Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy. This apparently generous policy, officially intended to help problem regions, is a fool' s bargain for French taxpayers. France contributes 17% of the European budget yet will receive only 8% of the regional Structural Funds. Between 1994 and 1999, our regions annually received an average of FF 15.4 billion but will receive only FF 14.7 billion between 2000 and 2006. My region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be particularly affected with French Hainaut losing the aid paid to Objective 1 regions. This loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free-trade Europe. The European regional policy also reinforces the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds.	el
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon, and I share his view. I believe that globalisation has helped many countries which, so far, have been on the sideline of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and, as far as I am aware, no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade. In other words, as indeed already remarked by Mr Gas√≤liba, globalisation is, in my view, positive, and I am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years. A second remark made by Mr Gas√≤liba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates. I think that he is correct in this regard. I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates. I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks, and that is why I am reiterating them here. Madam President, could I furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other? Surely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement. Madam President, I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting, in conjunction with my offices and colleagues, to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe, thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible. In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market, I am, in other words, opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions. You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would, in fact, impede international economic movement. Once again, the Tobin tax is, in my view, at odds with the Treaty of Rome, and this is an important, theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening. Madam President, apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations, there are also practical objections to the Tobin tax, as already underlined by Mr Karas and other speakers. It has unfortunately been observed, I have to say, that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures. This indicates how difficult these dossiers are. If we have not been able to reach agreement internally, I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners. I think that this will be problematic. Madam President, Mr Jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets. I think, however, that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes. I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when, as already stated, the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome. In order to remove these causes, one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question. Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English 'good governance' ? Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates? That the markets for production factors, including the labour market, operate flexibly? That is not always the case. So if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability, then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first.	de
We would not want the same misfortune to befall you now, as the programme that you have presented to us is so exhilarating that it could energise Europe and provide it with the future alluded to by Mr Goebbels. Nevertheless, you will have to have the means at your disposal, means which, I fear, you are somewhat lacking at present. It is thus up to you to create them. The straitjacket of Agenda 2000 will not provide you with the requisite means. You will thus have to encourage your colleagues to see to it that the proposals you make to us are going to be financed. Just one example - and it is one of the mechanisms central to your proposals - is that of the information and knowledge society. It is clear - and you explained this very well - that the social divide is a fundamental problem that we must eradicate. There is no need to add to this what I will call the digital divide. Indeed, to whom will you offer this information and knowledge society? To an increasingly aged or ageing population, to a population which, despite everything, is still poor, and to a population which is becoming, alas, less and less well educated. You will thus have to adopt a bottom-up approach if you do not want this knowledge society to amount to little more than the pursuit of profits by a number of successful and necessary new firms. This is not your objective. Unfortunately, there is one component missing from the mechanism that you have envisaged. I refer to the public services. The public services have played a key role throughout the entire existence of our European social model. It is true that the era of monopolies is past and that the Commission has initiated a process of liberalisation, of introducing competition into some public sectors in order to modernise them and improve their efficiency. But we cannot stop there. We must now define more clearly, within the context of competition and the information society, the principal public service roles of tomorrow as applicable to public undertakings and to private companies in this sector. What is needed, in this regard, are stronger measures, which do not yet feature in the Commission' s work programme, but to which you could give some impetus. This, it seems to me, would send out an extremely important signal. Lastly, this knowledge society hinges on research and development and I would like to applaud, at this juncture, the Commission initiative that aims to create a European research area. Mr President, the Commission and Parliament will nevertheless have need of the Council in order to secure the requisite resources to create this European research area. The framework programme will not suffice, it will have to be boosted, and its broad guidelines modified. This is a major task, but we are relying on you to see it through. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, you have spoken, Mr President, of a political deficit. I believe that the proposals you will put forward in Lisbon, which should help to merge these infamous broad economic policy guidelines, these 'Employment' guidelines, to form guidelines for the European policy on growth and employment, mark a step in the right direction.	el
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU, both on roads and railways and by sea. This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind. In area after area, we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States. This is extraordinarily positive, and there is cause to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for the work he has put in on this issue. This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned. If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running, it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also, as far as possible, apply to every country. I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance, namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament, Mr Ari Vatanen. In many ways, the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another. By approving this amendment, we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union. This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind. It is good that, in establishing the present regulations, we can also be flexible. I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment. Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority. The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously. I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations, and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts, in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible. For one thing is clear: even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union, traffic does not stop at our borders, it goes beyond them. Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions. If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at? Mr President, I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report, which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport. We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able, in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union. This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours. A moment ago, Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures, not of 20 degrees below zero, but of 40 degrees below zero. Of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature. I would like to say, with regard to Mr Swoboda' s comments on the activity of the CEN, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded. Lastly, Mr President, the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out. We have referred to the delay by the CEN, the amendment of certain provisions, the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific. The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which are contained in the various amendments, specifically four. We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	fi
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council. The project has been long and problematic. In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources. Although there is much that is good about the new directive, it is nonetheless not without its defects. One example is the use of peat. Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels. If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned. It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal. The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union' s dependence on imported energy. Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU' s next round of enlargement. Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries, whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy. The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate. We are all concerned about the environment and our children' s future. The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased, but it has to be done in a rational manner. We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come. For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy. Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme. Firstly, however, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the truly excellent work he has done on this report. I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan. For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee. However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout. Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point, that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community. This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear. However, we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed. For in the course of the next few years, the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double, accounting for at least 12% of energy consumption. This is the European Union' s declared aim. That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role. In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples.	de
But at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where, when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the European Union. Commissioner Fischler, of course, knows me from a long time back and I have written to him on BSE and many other issues in agriculture but now that he is responsible for fisheries I am going to have to berate him on fisheries, along with his lusty colleagues, because one of the areas that has been most affected has been my region and the fishermen of Northern Ireland. In actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense, without any real negotiation or discussion. It has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period. Now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks, but what I am really saying to you Commissioner, and I have said this to you in the Fisheries Committee and I will say it to you again: There is a wide divide between Brussels and the working fishermen. It does not matter whether you come from Galicia, it does not matter whether you are from Northern Ireland or whether you are from Scotland. That chasm exists and we in Brussels have not been able to cross that divide. And we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen. We have got to take on board the concerns of the fishermen and we have got to work closely with them and I hope that you, as the Commissioner responsible for fisheries, will recognise that divide and will try and work as closely as you possibly can to ensure that all sides are brought together and their views are taken on board. Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. Bankruptcy procedures The next item is the report A5-0039/2000 by Mr Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Finland, with a view to the adoption of a Council regulation on insolvency proceedings (9178/1999 - C5-0069/1999 - 1999/0806(CNS)). Mr President, I think we all agree that a European legal area must be created. We also all agree that there should be harmonisation in a field that is marked by the great disparity of our legal systems and, what is more, concepts. The very word bankruptcy, the legal concept of bankruptcy, does not cover the same accounting concept in each of the Member States of the Union. We therefore all agree on the established facts, and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction. If I may, however, just make a few comments on the method. When you observe - and you cannot fail to do so - the disparity in the legal systems and concepts, and the fact that we wish to improve coordination, I believe that there are three ways in which we can proceed. The first is to establish equivalence, saying: in the final analysis, bankruptcy in France is the same thing as bankruptcy in England or in Germany.	el
Madam President, allow me briefly to correct what the President-in-Office of the Council said. Two heads of government, Mr President-in-Office, have already been reprimanded by their parliaments for the steps which they initiated against Austria. You therefore had no right to speak on behalf of their countries; on the contrary, you obviously spoke as the head of a socialist party. At most, Mr President-in-Office, you can therefore only speak of twelve countries. Mrs Flemming, the debate on Austria should not be restarted as we have already had an exchange of views on this issue. I will give the floor to Mr Schulz who wanted to raise a point of order on a personal challenge made in yesterday' s debate. Madam President, I seldom make use of these rules but I must do so now for the record. During the debate, Mr Gollnisch, a member of the French extreme right, attacked me personally. I should like to state the following for the record: I have nothing to take back as regards my statement that the extreme right is abusing this House for rabble-rousing purposes. Mr Gollnisch stated for my benefit during his speech that his family, and these were his words, would never accept fascism. That is where Mr Gollnisch clearly differs from his family, because he himself accepts fascism or, to put it plainly, he is a fascist. Thirdly, I should like to state for the record that the fact that such speeches are given here fills me with consternation, as does the fact, which I ascertained from his loud applause, that Caudillos Le Pen is still allowed to sit in this House, despite the fact that he has already lost his eligibility for office on account of his prize fighting activities in the French election campaign. Mr Schulz, we have noted your statement. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at noon. Eurodac Mr President-in-Office of the Council, firstly I would like to thank the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for their high level presence in this House and for their positive attitude. Last year, this Parliament was consulted twice about the establishment of a system for comparing fingerprints. In principle, the system is intended to correctly implement the Dublin Convention. On 13 April 1999, this Parliament rejected the Council' s proposal to extend the Eurodac system to illegal immigrants by means of a protocol. This Parliament was then consulted again in accordance with the provisions of Amsterdam. We were once again told that this system has to be developed in order to correctly implement the Dublin Convention. This seems all very well to me, with the limits introduced by Parliament in its last report, with the amendments which ranged from our reservations about the inclusion of children under 14 in the system to the request that this Eurodac system be only applied to the Dublin Convention. Given that we have been informed that none of our suggestions are going to be accepted, I would like to ask the Council whether it is prepared to hold a genuine dialogue with Parliament.	el
It is vital that the IGC prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty. One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court. Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention. Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy. My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent. Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believes that the European Parliament' s decision to rush headlong into giving its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference undermines the political significance of the request for talks with the Council, and in the end, makes it rather irrelevant. We would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion, and frankly, we did not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by scheduling the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine' s day, the first day of the Strasbourg part-session. Moreover, given that this opinion is quite important, we can still vote for it, and indeed, the majority of our group will be voting for it. I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform. The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States. It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that, in any case, the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act, and to prevent and rectify the course of events. We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference, and I firmly hope that this opinion, that was given reluctantly, will not mean that the European Parliament ceases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise, but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, to my mind, it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful. After all, we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance, that is to say, we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future. How, though, is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now, i.e. before enlargement takes place? That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference.	el
In the postal sector the first phase is already in progress, as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation. The new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment. On the availability of the studies, - a point raised by Mr Staes and others - copies of each of the studies were handed to Parliament in September 1999. They have all been available on the Commission' s Internet website since August 1999 and the Commission is willing to provide copies to anybody who is interested. The studies have been the object of some criticism, especially on the part of the public postal services. I am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data. This was no surprise, since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection. Does that not say a lot about management ability? No single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties. Nevertheless, Mr Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision-making process. I finally come to three interventions about a subject I am supposed to know better than postal services, that is competition. Mr Purvis, I found your methodologically provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth exploring. Mr Medina Ortega, I am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise, through unchecked concentration, to private operators. This applies both to the post and other sectors. If I can provide one example of this sort of vigilance, it is the case of Deutsche Post where, following complaints and an action before the court, the Commission initiated a formal state aid procedure in July. We have just received the reply of the German Government to the observations made. The state aid procedure covers the question of cross-subsidisation between monopoly letter services and commercial business parcel activities as well as the financing of Deutsche Post' s numerous recent acquisitions. I will not go into the details due to lack of time, but this is perhaps one illustration of the fact that the Commission does not stop its work as liberalisation progresses. In a sense this is where its work begins. Finally, Mr Radwan, of course, there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition. In particular, if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest, where a Member State defines a mission of public service, it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition. I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition.	fr
"From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance, which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens. Yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate, if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority. The interlinking of the EU institutions, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well. Yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction? Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what' but more 'what are we doing together' ? It is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens. In your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us. I would add to these the future of our social model. This is why I and my group are so firmly insisting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The reason our timetable includes the drafting of this Charter is because we are at a key point in our history. Our Union needs to redefine the values on which it is based, both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire, but not under just any conditions. Our people expect more Europe, but not just any Europe. They are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather, on the basis of our social model, to be able to organise globalisation. In this respect I must say that, in terms of your commitment to a political union, to which we are favourable, this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model, on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I should like to start with a quote: ""The Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme. The Commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration. It wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime"" . That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security, freedom, citizens' rights and judicial cooperation. A paper this short is a farce. A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand. A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard. It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard. We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme. What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand. We want instruments to prevent abuse. We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime. We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation, on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group. This is not the case in other areas, as has already been pointed out. We share these views because we are in favour of world trade, but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards, common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind. This aim is that trade should benefit development, and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world' s most dynamic and competitive regions."	fi
This too is characteristic of American society, which hears little about it. They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents, but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country. Today, the Dineh Indians are facing their final fight for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, for their right to their way of life. There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful, economic adversary. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers, but I would like to emphasise a few things. The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians. They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years. They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years. The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries. The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples. This relocation is, of course, unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic, social and cultural terms. The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and, in that way, lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their forefathers - but also any prospect of work and sources of income. The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry. Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives. The population was not allowed any input. This resembles a kind of trade in human beings. The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium. After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world' s most contaminated areas. The United States administration, the coal industry and all of us need to acquit ourselves of our responsibility and provide a sound alternative: either the soil is cleaned or the Dineh Indians are allocated a proper place where provision is made for all kinds of support, be it in the psychological, social, cultural or budgetary field. It is high time we respected the rights of the Indians. This is why we ask you to vote for this resolution: we in Europe should not be intimidated by American interests which are being pushed by financial, religious and industrial groups. So let us contact the United States now! Mr President, in terms of human rights, there is of course a great deal amiss in Chechnya. We have received reports from human rights organisations saying that Russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - I am talking about old men and women - in Grozny. Citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air-raid shelters. We insist that these violations of human rights are investigated. Despite the pledges made, violations in, for example, Alfanyurt have still not been investigated. International government organisations and non-governmental organisations must be allowed access, and the Union' s general Council decided on 6 December 1999 to send representatives from the Member States to Ingushetia to study the humanitarian situation there.	de
"I urge both institutions to turn it into something tangible, something concrete, and to do something constructive with it. In any case, we will judge them on their actions, not their words. Mr President, Commissioners, I would like to heartily congratulate the rapporteurs Mrs Malmstr√∂m and Mr Haarder on excellent, systematic and innovative reports. They provide the Commission, the Council, and also Parliament, with many ideas to really improve and guarantee human rights. One example of this is Mrs Malmstr√∂m's suggestion of a special representative to protect those fighting for human rights. It is also the duty of Parliament to examine the question of human rights in the candidate countries in a systematic way. We have the knowledge, but we need to coordinate it and ensure that it is put to use so that we can influence the enlargement of the Union in such a way that human rights are respected. I am also very pleased that Mr Haarder took up the rights of minority groups. It will be an historic moment if we adopt Mr Haarder's report and call attention to the crimes and the lack of respect for the rights of minority groups that are found within the EU. It is time to put a stop to the contradictory messages we have been giving out in this regard and which have meant that we have required more of the candidate countries than we have of ourselves. In actual fact, I have no hesitation in saying that it will be an historic moment when we adopt Mr Haarder's report because it would not previously have been possible. Finally, I would like to mention another matter that is close to my heart, namely aid for the Commission's work for children's rights as expressed in Cecilia Malmstr√∂m's report. The Commission needs this aid. We ought also to give aid when it comes to allocating budget funds to work for children's rights. I also believe that, in this area, we need to guard against children' s becoming a commodity. There is also a lack of respect for the rules of the Hague Convention and, as far as this is concerned, we also have very, very serious problems in the candidate countries. Mr President, we have before us an exceptionally high standard report on human rights, and I am now speaking of Mrs Malmstr√∂m' s report, and what is also gratifying about it is the fact that it was drafted in close cooperation with independent NGOs. Without civil society we are living in a vacuum. We cannot breathe unless we are motivated from outside, from grassroots level. The report contains a number of excellent and well-considered proposals. I would like to draw your attention here to just three, regarding which my Group has been active. They are: the need to act when independent journalists are attacked, the need to protect conscientious objectors and deserters, and the need to develop smart sanctions, which do not make conditions wretched for vast sections of the population, but which are targeted at the political tyrants that have amassed riches. This is a precision weapon, which must be utilised more. Speaking more generally, as Mrs Malmstr√∂m herself also said, we have to develop a strategic approach to all the problems we are speaking about today. It must be a dynamic one and one that can penetrate the reality of the situation at all levels. We cannot go about correcting obvious wrongdoings by merely resorting to rhetorical commitment. The Finnish writer Samuli Paronen wrote: ""big crimes need many accomplices, millions - all those who do nothing"" . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think these reports speak for themselves. Racism and antisemitism are on the increase in the European Union and beyond. Our first act must therefore be not only to refuse to accept this situation but to publicly denounce it. Due to its clear-sightedness, Mrs Ludford' s report actively contributes to this approach. Denouncing racism, including racist talk, does not mean censoring the freedom of opinion as some would have us believe. Racism is not an opinion. It is a crime against human dignity. It is antisocial behaviour which can include physical attacks on individuals. This has recently been seen in El Ejido in Spain and it also happened with the attacks on the homes of Turkish workers in Rostock and with the death of young Ibrahim Ali who was killed in Marseilles in 1995 by billposters of the French National Front."	fi
Question No 3 by (H-0027/00): Subject: Indictment of NATO before War Crimes Tribunal Human rights organisations, such as the US Human Rights Watch, have already collected significant evidence of NATO crimes in connection with the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia with a view to bringing a case before the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. On the basis of this evidence, some of which has already been lodged with the Tribunal, NATO is accused of 'serious violations of international humanitarian law' and 'wilful murder'. Does the Council consider that such accusations should be put before the War Crimes Tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation? In the event of a judicial inquiry into the accusations against NATO, what will be done in respect of the High Representative for the CFSP, who was NATO Secretary-General during the crisis? Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed? Mr President, Mr Alavanos' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues. The Council has already, on various occasions, stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by NATO were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. I am aware that there may be different views about NATO' s action and the legitimacy of that action. Everyone is free to hold such views. In my own country, the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter. That was how it was. In any case, the Council' s position is clear in that it considers that the objective of the air campaign carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo caused by the Belgrade regime. This objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April. I must say that these NATO measures were not taken lightly and were only carried out as a last resort when it became evident that all avenues for reaching a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the Belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces in order to expel the Kosovo Albanians from their land. I am sure you are aware, Mr Alavanos, that, during her recent visit to NATO headquarters, Prosecutor Del Ponte stressed that the International Tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it, including those made against NATO, in particular by pacifist groups from Canada. This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted. In any case, I have with me a statement made by Prosecutor Del Ponte according to which NATO is not at present under any investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning NATO' s actions in the Kosovo conflict. All information received during the past six months, either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of NATO' s actions during the Kosovo conflict, have been recorded by the Prosecutor. Any other information will of course be analysed by the Prosecutor, who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action.	de
There are a few points at stake tomorrow. Firstly, we know that the ship is the most environmentally friendly mode of transport for carrying passengers and goods. At the same time we know that ships make a hefty contribution to polluting the sea with rubbish, cargo residues and oily slime. The fuel used by ships happens to be heavy oil and we know that this heavy oil leaves a residue of between 1% and 3% as oily slime, which is typically discharged into the sea. I think that we agree that ships have to dispose of waste and residues in port. It follows - and in fact there is no other logical conclusion - that the cardinal rule for clean seas is that it must no longer be worthwhile for waste to be disposed of illegally on the high seas. This is what this is about, and a majority of us have said as much in debates here. In January we had a very thorough debate with you, Commissioner, on the consequences of the Erika disaster. On this occasion we once again drew together all the points on ship safety and clean seas. And this directive on port reception facilities for cargo residues is, of course, also about the question of how to make our seas cleaner. Just for information, we know that 70 000 m3 of detritus is illegally discharged into the North Sea alone every year and, conversely, we know that at present a maximum of 5% to 10% of ships obey the rules and dispose of their waste in port. This scandal is not acceptable in the eyes of the Council either. The Council is after all also saying that all ports must have appropriate port reception facilities available and must be equipped with them. The conflict now is ultimately over the issue of how payments will be made. In its first reading, Parliament said by a large majority that the ships must make a significant contribution, of at least 90%. And therein lies the difference with the Council, which is saying that a contribution has to be made. But a contribution might also only mean half a euro and in this case God knows this would be too little. Nothing would change. There would be no financial pressure on ships to obey the rules. What is needed is a standard waste disposal fee for all ships irrespective of how much they actually use the disposal facilities, meaning that the financial incentive to dispose of waste at sea has to be removed, which - as has already been explained here today - was possible in the Baltic Sea through the HELCOM Agreement and the 'no-special-fee' system. If it can be done there it must also be possible for it to work for the remaining European seas, because this is not only about the environment: it is about clean waters, it even has consequences for tourism and - the decisive point - alongside the environmental issue it is also about fair competition. The same conditions must apply to all ships in port and only if Parliament, the Council and the Commission create these conditions together will this fair competition be restored for ports and ships. I think that this is also about the credibility of the Union and, in particular, Parliament. I think that people are tired of seeing the hypocrisy of Europe and of ministers each time that there is a catastrophe, as we saw of course with 'Erika' .	de
Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy. There is also another hidden way of making workers redundant, as practised for example in Spain by the Ericsson company under the term 'externalising' . Note that sensitive words like 'redundancy' are not used. Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights. This is just an underhand way of making workers redundant. Commissioner, if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment, they must take clear steps to secure this. They must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations. They must revise the directive on collective redundancies, reduce the working day, link European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union. Mr President, sadly, once again, Parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in Europe. Yet again, workers are likely to lose their jobs. This time, I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina. As has already been pointed out, in one month' s time, 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income. Despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe - these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle, while Goodyear, after years of benefiting from state and European subsidies, is totally free to walk out. I do not think this is at all fair, either to the workers at the Cisterna plant or to all those Italian and European citizens whose taxes have, albeit indirectly, enabled Goodyear to benefit from the state aids I have just mentioned. The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs. Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant. Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to remind the House that there is very little time available, and therefore that any measure - including those already cited by the Commission in its introductory report - which we adopt must have an immediate, timely effect. Mr President, Commissioner, as far as restructuring goes, there is no doubt that European companies must adapt so that they are better placed to face new challenges or go under. We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management.	de
For that reason we will have to pay very serious attention in the future to ensuring that Member States really do adopt systems we are here taking joint decisions on. If that is not the case, there will have to be some form of sanction to ensure these matters are put right. Mr President, I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating the rapporteur. He has approached this matter with his usual conviction and great dedication. I was very pleased to hear him say that there is no real conflict on the principles and objectives of the proposed directive. I have no doubt that the Commissioner will assist in reaching a satisfactory resolution because both Parliament and the Commission have a common goal in relation to this very important and very crucial area. The directive on inter-Community trade in bovine animals is central to the economic survival of livestock farmers, particularly from my own country, Ireland, where we export up to 90% of our entire livestock production - a very high proportion of which is live exports to continental Europe and beyond. In this regard, I support proposals for a further update of the 1997 directive with the caution that it must be done in a sensible way. We need to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy while, at the same time, providing total traceability with regard to livestock movement as well as safeguarding public health. Mr President, this proposal introduces an extension of a current exemption to Directive 64/432 applicable to the Spanish Government. Without this exemption, it would be required to implement a system of veterinary checks for tuberculosis and brucellosis, for each bovine animal exported from its region. These are already, of course, implemented by many other states. This exemption has important implications for my country. Whilst Spain is being given exemption, the British meat industry is suffering heavily from the implementation of an allied directive which requires ruinously expensive veterinary checks in our slaughterhouses. So rigorous are the requirements for veterinary supervision that we do not have enough British vets to carry out the work. But instead of giving us more time, the Commission has commenced infringement proceedings. In order to avoid ending up in the European Court of Justice, my government has had to recruit large numbers of EU vets, 300 of whom come from Spain. If Spain has such a large surplus of vets that it can afford to send so many to my country, why is it having such difficulty implementing the system of veterinary checks required by this directive? It does not seem right to me that British slaughterhouses should be put through the hoops as a result of the Commission's action whilst Spain is allowed to default on its obligations. Why is the Commission giving Spain such an easy time? Should it not be asking why Spain can afford to send so many vets over to the United Kingdom to implement a related directive and perhaps be insisting that some of these officials be retained in their homeland to implement Community law in their own country?	el
Now it transpires that the situation could deteriorate even further as EU applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe are projected to increase their net exports of pigmeat by nearly 300% by the year 2006. At the same time they will be seeking derogations from the EU to enable them to produce pork to welfare and hygiene standards that would be considered illegal under current EU law. If Britain is once again to reactivate a dynamic intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine, then immediate help is required to alleviate the catastrophic situation affecting rural Britain and affecting our pig and beef sectors in particular. I hope this message is getting through to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. Mr President, I also agree with the rapporteur with regard to the basic matters and I can naturally and gladly sympathise with the amendment calling for the transition period to be just two years. This is a case of negligence on the part of the Member States in putting these matters and the system into effect. This is an issue concerning serious animal diseases, and I think the most essential matter in this discussion is the fact that we have to quickly adopt the system to avoid repeated postponement of legal provisions that should take effect as soon as possible. Mr Stevenson mentioned that exports from East Europe are increasing: we are now expanding the area of the EU to include the countries of Eastern Europe. If our own systems are not in order, how can we expect new Member States to be able to be ready to join our system of agricultural policy? We have to stress the importance of the fact that food safety and the European agricultural model should be a basic issue with us and one that serves as a vision of the future, but in the Member States we are ignoring issues of a basic nature which would help monitor systems that would ensure this. For that reason we will have to pay very serious attention in the future to ensuring that Member States really do adopt systems we are here taking joint decisions on. If that is not the case, there will have to be some form of sanction to ensure these matters are put right. Mr President, I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating the rapporteur. He has approached this matter with his usual conviction and great dedication. I was very pleased to hear him say that there is no real conflict on the principles and objectives of the proposed directive.

In recent times, Africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help, but nothing tangible has yet been achieved. In recent years in Africa, we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy, but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes. Africa is, for us, a worrying topic for discussion. We therefore have another duty at international level, which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade: the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries, not just in terms of writing off debts, but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world, with a great deal of willingness on our part, which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice. We need to provide alternative answers, otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe' s positive roles in history. All over the world, Europe' s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities. We should remember that we, the European Union, are a union of minorities: we are all a minority within Europe. There are concerns even within the Fifteen, concerns which may even surface again in the next decade. I am referring to the situation in Austria, where the Commission has remained true to its role, being duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union, but also the unwavering guardian of the Treaties, ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy, law and respect for minorities. Some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message I sent to Chancellor Sch√ºssel. My message to you is: do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content. Reread the letter: The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat, Article 6 of the Treaty. I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the Commission when they were elected. This is what we wish to do: maintain our role as a supranational structure, maintain the role conferred on us by the Treaties, but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts. Last November, the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive. I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion. I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme: the economy and quality of life. I have already talked about the economy: we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs. We must continue to keep inflation under control, proceed with liberalisation, ensure more competition, encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies; push forward with science, and push back scientific boundaries, and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science.	el
As for the arrangements covering European Union assistance to the western Balkans, Members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and streamline their management and to put everything under one regulation. I am aware that there is concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and, especially, at the loss of association with the PHARE name. I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score. I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion. I want to stress, however, that whatever the programme is called, our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbours into the European family is stronger than ever. In general I trust that Members of this House will share my pleasure that Macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly. I hope that the other countries of the region will redouble their efforts to make similar progress. I look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking, I hope, the success of what we are trying to do in the Balkans which, for me, remains the single most important litmus-test of what Europe is able to do on its own doorstep. Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m. Agreement on comitology The next item is the report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the implementation of the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 on comitology (1999/468/EC). . (IT) Mr President, the approval of this agreement with the Commission on procedures for implementing the Council decision on comitology marks the end of a saga which has kept Parliament busy for two years, along with a few enthusiasts scattered among the various institutions of the Union, whom many people do not hesitate to call masochists. Until 1993, the way the Commission exercised its executive powers, and in particular the mysterious and even suspect committee arrangements, was creating conflict and mistrust between the institutions, and threatening to have serious consequences on the legislative procedure. That is why, in accordance with Declaration No 31, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union institutions have undertaken a complex task of negotiation and consultation, resulting in the new Council decision, which revises the old system quite substantially, although we are not entirely satisfied with it. In particular, the decision outlines a form of parliamentary control whereby Parliament can sound the alarm if an implementing measure, deriving from an act adopted under the codecision procedure, oversteps the implementing powers delegated to the Commission. During the protracted interinstitutional negotiations - which saw Parliament actively involved, thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Adelaide Aglietta - it was understood that the European Parliament and Commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedures for implementing certain aspects of the new decision. On the one hand, certain points which the Council did not intend to incorporate into the decision were to be made explicit and, on the other, the system for providing information about implementing measures and monitoring them was to be organised more precisely. During the trialogue held on 6 October 1999 in Strasbourg, the Presidents of the European Parliament and the Commission approved the idea of concluding this agreement soon. We believe we have respected that commitment, and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the Commission. Essentially, the agreement deals with two points: one is the right of the European Parliament to be informed, which is the sine qua non for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to Article 8 of the decision. Hitherto, such information had been supplied on paper and unsystematically, and was of no use to our services; and indeed this was often the fault of Parliament itself.	fi
It is not your job, it is our job to decide on that. It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament. I just want to discuss it with you, no more and no less. We can do so without going off at other tangents. I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously. Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously, and that includes the Tobin tax! Madam President, an omission appears to have been made. In the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out, no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the PSE, ELDR, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA Groups and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Co√ªteaux. Mr D√©sir, I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution. If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled, it will be included. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m. (The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m.) Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting Mr President, I simply wanted to pass on some news. There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid. Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died. On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts. Thank you, Mrs Fraga Est√©vez. We had heard about this regrettable incident. Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish. (The Minutes were approved) Resumption of the session I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000. Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy. Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans. Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least. I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims' families. Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment. Agenda The next item is the order of business. Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government.	fr
Thirdly, I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important. I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated, namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions, the consumption of alcohol will remain the same. The question is then, of course, where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers? The answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves, and as Mr Andersson knows, this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity. Well now, Mr Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol. But in that case, not only Sweden, but all EU countries, should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol. We can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the United States. Mr Andersson will be familiar with what was termed then 'prohibition' . He will also be aware of the effects the ban had on Mafia activity within the United States, where, eventually, prohibition was withdrawn. All this means that we need to protect health, of course, but not by banning alcohol, because that does not work. Mr President, the question at issue is the income from the Swedish alcohol monopoly and when the Swedish Government says that it must cover health costs, then this is proof of a distortion of competition because other countries must cover their health costs themselves, with no alcohol monopoly at their disposal. My question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate intake of good quality alcohol such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the Swedish budget. I gather that Mr Posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter. I also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol products in Sweden goes back to the year 1638 and that since then, the sale of alcohol products has accounted for a significant portion of the state' s tax revenue. As is known, this has led to a state monopoly in Sweden which, in itself, is at odds with Union legislation. As to the healing effect of alcohol - to which, I believe, Mr Posselt also made reference - I could not agree more with him: I think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant, and perhaps Mr Posselt, Mr Andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this Parliament one of these days to share an aquavit. Mr President, I listened with interest to the Commissioner's reply about the need to apply the laws of the single market. I wonder whether he can say whether he considers his reply to be compatible with the failure by the Commission to take the French Government to the European Court of Justice on the application of France's Loi et Vin, which effectively prevents single market rules applying to the sale of alcohol products in France? Can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice? I should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable Member, since this matter is now under active consideration by the Commission. The Commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice. My reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now, but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks. I ask for the Member's understanding for this small delay in the Commission's decision. Commissioner, do you have any reason, on public health grounds, for a difference in the taxation rates on, for example, Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague's Bavarian beer? Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe? The matter of excise taxes, to which the honourable Member is referring, is the prerogative of the Member State concerned. The Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products. Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States.	fi
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this. I am convinced that this is an error of judgement. A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement. A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries. Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level. It is not, however, possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union. This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank. This is untenable. If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic, the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered. The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity. Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible. The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective. Article 56 of the Treaty, prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital, must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control. In the majority of EU countries, there are now governments dominated by social democrats. It is remarkable that, now they have the opportunity to do so, none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union. It also, of course, damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital. The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference. It is, however, important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States. It is the Member States' parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty. It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification. Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text, which I shall vote for, even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it. Nevertheless, the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right. The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world.	fr
In our opinion, the aim of the Lisbon Council should in fact be to iron out these inflexibilities, to promote flexibility and the ability to adjust, and to exchange positive national experiences with a view to fostering the creativity that can only flourish when peoples are given freedom of choice. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, in the speeches which we have heard a noble aim has been mentioned, that of we Europeans becoming competitive with the United States, of developing ourselves into equal partners with the United States. If we consider our gross national product, that ought actually to be possible. If, on the other hand, we look, for example, at the issue of filling top posts - when it is a question of finding a new Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund - and see how the Europeans behave towards the Americans, then without a doubt we are still a very long way from this equal partnership. We now need to ask ourselves why this is the case. Of course there are sectors of the business world, including the new media, in which we occupy leading positions. Here I need only mention mobile telephones. We have banned them here in the Chamber, rightly, because they are instruments of torment. At the same time, however, they also make life much easier for many people because they create jobs. And in Europe we are world leaders in this field. Why? We are world leaders because we managed to adopt a common set of European rules; early on we decided on a common European standard which today has become a world standard. This means that if we in Europe get our act together in good time then we will also be competitive in this field of new technologies. Where then do Europe's shortcomings actually lie? I believe, Mr President-in-Office, that we cannot eliminate the shortcomings by setting up more observatories as is planned at present. I believe that these observatories create a handful of jobs for officials, but that they do not create any jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises. We in Europe are deficient where training is concerned. This is shown by the fact that where the new media are concerned we are having to import from countries outside Europe. Europe lacks, as has already been stated, entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial spirit. There are too few young people who are willing to take the risk of being self-employed. The way in which we structure our work and the way in which work is organised is not flexible enough. Establishing additional rigid rules - such as, for example, introducing a rigid 35-hour week in France - can, I admit, create jobs in the short term, but I am convinced that in the long term it damages our competitiveness and thus destroys jobs. In Europe we are also still a long way from a common domestic market. We have 15 domestic markets and a common European internal market. For electronic commerce we need common, clear, European rules. We need a European patent at a reasonable price; we do not have that yet either. This European patent is so expensive that it is not competitive with other patents. We need the European company legislation, and not least we need to adapt our social security systems to the new reality of a common Europe, because this too forms the basis of what we call the social model, namely a social market economy for Europe. Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Gut√≠errez for his speech tonight and also for his Lisbon initiative, which is very important to us. If we are honest, we must admit that it has been a very long road from Luxembourg to Lisbon, and that really now we are looking for concrete achievements, for something to genuinely come out of this Lisbon Summit. We have a lot of Europeans in the gallery here with us this evening and I wonder what they make of our discussion here this evening. I would like them to take away with them this evening the idea that the institutions of the European Union are now embarked upon a genuine process, which will lead to full employment once again in the European Union. There are many challenges involved with creating that full employment. Some of those challenges will be very difficult to overcome, but the important thing is that we have to turn the rhetoric of what we have been saying for many, many years - about full employment, about a socially inclusive society, about a society that is based on innovation and knowledge - into reality.	fi
Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration. We Liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly, just as Paolo Costa reported. It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report. Macedonia deserves our support, especially in view of the self-sacrificial, disinterested work which the people and leaders of Macedonia undertook during the Kosovo war. Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms. We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans. This is an urgent duty for the EU. Mr President, allow me in this context to remind MEPs - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war, human degradation, murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia. The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free. I am talking about Milosevic. As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path, Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans, including in Macedonia. Mr President, the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe, Its terms, which the Swoboda report accepts, are certainly not directed towards peace, but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country, and towards controlling its natural wealth, overexploiting its workforce and continuing to use that country as a springboard against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order. All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union. The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe. It is characteristic that the report congratulates FYROM on the constructive stance it maintained during the NATO attack, eulogises its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for NATO forces, but, of course, remains silent about the indignation of its people, which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the NATO bombardments. Finally, because we consider that both the stability pact and the stabilisation and association process the European Union is implementing in countries in that area, will create new problems there, new tribulations for their peoples, and will reinforce the dominant role of the American and European imperialists, we will be voting against the report in an expression of our solidarity with the people of FYROM. Mr President, Commissioner, one of the most basic aims of the European Union' s stability and association agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area, and this, of course, presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved.	el
"In the light of developments in recent days, it might well be asked what we really are to do about these intergovernmental conferences and treaty amendments when government leaders - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decisions in relation to an independent Member State entailing intervention in that Member State' s democratic process. You can think what you like about Mr Haider, and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician, but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country' s democratic process. When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen. I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon. On 14 February, we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000. This is a big task but it can be done. I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement. In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important ""Amsterdam leftovers"" . These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe. In relation to the latter point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining. We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission. I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point. At the IGC, we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution. We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty. In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions. So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully. We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents. The Treaty of Amsterdam, Mr President, has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe. Mr President, I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution, which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible."	fr
As we go from directives to amendments, however, these six products become seven, eight, nine, up to and including soya, oilseed rape and GMOs. We are also told that the cocoa fraud will be limited to 5% to begin with, then to 10%, not to mention that no check will ever be carried out, in the same way that, for example, the boxes of Chiquita bananas are not checked, which are supposed to weigh eighteen kilograms and in fact weigh twenty. The checks are pointless in any case, as we are told that the margin of error is 1%, whereas scientists tell us that it is in fact 40%. We are told above all to 'eat and drink without fear, you are protected by the label' . Yet the label is a deception in graphic terms because it is illegible and a hypocrisy in scientific terms because the mention of 'palm oil' , for example, is drowned among the list of ingredients. Just as in the case of port we are not told 'South African counterfeit' , for cocoa we are not told 'counterfeit' . Then, lacking arguments to justify the chocolate fraud, the multinationals say, 'You must accept 5%, or there will be wholesale fraud.' What then? All you have to do is call the product 'shea-late' if it is made from shea nuts, or 'soya-late' if it is made from soya, but not 'chocolate' . The 388 000 tonnes of French chocolate, for example, must be made from cocoa, and the French turnover of FRF 19 billion, for example, must be earned honestly by small specialists. It is a legal obligation with regard to the Ivory Coast and African farmers. We are linked by the Lom√© convention and by the convention on commodities which the European Union has signed, with reference to cocoa. It is also a financial obligation. If we do not fulfil it, then we shall be forced to compensate for the losses in these countries under the Stabex system. It is an obligation in terms of health and food safety, since the substitutes for cocoa, such as Brazil nuts, may cause immunological reactions. Finally, it is a question of honesty, of morality. Let us put an end to this widespread dishonesty, where you begin with a product incorrectly described as chocolate and you end with a Commission incorrectly described as European, whose members are Americanically-modified organisms and whose standard is a flag of convenience concealing a globalist cargo. Mr President, Commissioner, genetically modified organisms and mad cow disease were not enough to temper the enthusiasm of those involved in food manipulation. Humans are continuing to play the sorcerer' s apprentice, juggling with food safety. Here, courtesy of industrial lobbying, we have chocolate with added vegetable fats. Its cocoa content is going to be reduced by 15% but it is still going to be entitled to the designation 'chocolate' . This is the crux of the problem. There is a clear lack of transparency, and yet we distinguish butter from margarine. There will perhaps be a discreet entry, in small letters on the back of the package, indicating its new composition. There will be deterioration in the quality, of course, but also in the flavour, and the goods are clearly not what they are represented as being. This is unfair competition, with this ersatz, pseudo-chocolate being sold cheaper than pure chocolate manufactured by craftsmen with proper respect for authenticity, ethics and tradition. It offers the prospect of large profits, however, for the multinationals, who have been working behind the scenes for around fifteen years to achieve their ends, i.e. having the derogations granted, on the occasion of a number of countries' joining the Union, extended to become the general rule. On the other hand, it represents a cause for concern among small specialist chocolate-makers and also developing countries which are cocoa producers, whose compensation is being seriously considered. Finally, there is one major problem, while today we know how to detect vegetable fats in chocolate, we are still incapable of identifying and quantifying them. There is, therefore, no traceability and the door is open to all sorts of abuses.	fi
"We have humane reasons, we have reasons when it comes to children, as far as the age limit is concerned; for example we cannot accept the age limit of 14. We highlighted all these problems in a resolution by Parliament. For this reason, it is of course most important for us, for my group, to see how seriously you take Parliament, how you deal with our proposals and, in the final analysis, we hope that we will continue to be able to report gladly and proudly on how well we are cooperating together. The question is whether you are willing to lend us an ear when something gives us cause for concern and we urgently need your support. Mr President, esteemed Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the debate on EURODAC and the implementation of this system is something of a never ending story. It started back in Dublin in 1990. In November 1999, we here in Parliament, and I assume you too Commissioner, believed that we were on the home stretch and were finally going to be able to implement EURODAC. Set targets were tabled on several occasions and, on balance, we welcomed the fact, and I personally was pleased, and that' s a rare occurrence, when you said, following the vote in Parliament, that you would not accept the proposals adopted by a majority in Parliament which we, I should add, had voted against. That too was a very positive aspect. All in all, I would have been pleased to see this system implemented for the simple reason that it is this system alone which makes Dublin enforceable and because it allows the jurisdiction of the Member State responsible for the asylum procedure to be established unequivocally, thereby indirectly dividing the burden to a certain extent. Plus, we could then prevent multiple applications for asylum and abuse of the asylum system and this, in turn, would allow us, as it were, to fight illegal immigration indirectly. In other words, it is, as a whole, a system which must be seen as very positive and absolutely necessary in the context of asylum and immigration policy and the responsibility of the Member States. What filled me with consternation was the fact that the Council then upset the whole applecart at its meeting on 2 December by refusing to accept that implementing powers should remain with the Commission, i.e. that the competent regulatory committee should be able to act under the chairmanship of the Commission. The upshot of this was that we failed to achieve what we wanted to do, i.e. to communitise the system; on the contrary, the Council upset our plans by more or less announcing yet again that it was staking its claim. As a result, it is not the Commission which controls this instrument in the interests of the Community; on the contrary the initiative is again with the Council and, as a result, the Commission and, in the final analysis, Parliament too are excluded. We will not and cannot accept this because it involves consequences which are so far-reaching that, in the end, there will be no control over the efficiency of the system, it will no longer be possible to collate statistics for the purposes of analysis and action and a delay has been caused which is absolutely unacceptable on account of the fact that we need this system. My question to you is this: when can we really expect to see the EURODAC system which we have waited so long for up and running? How will the system actually be configured? Will it comply with the rules and with our requests for the Commission to be fully responsible for implementation, because then we would have achieved our own necessary goal; we would have re-Europeanised one part, because it makes sense here to actually implement this communitisation. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall reply very directly to the questions that have been raised, so as to avoid any possible doubt about the Council' s position, and I think it is indeed important for that position to be clarified. With regard to the scope of the Eurodac system, I would like to recall that Article 1 of the proposal for a regulation on establishing this system is very clear, so let me quote it: ""A system known as 'Eurodac' is hereby established, the purpose of which shall be to assist in determining which Member State is to be responsible pursuant to the Dublin Convention,"" I repeat, ""pursuant to the Dublin Convention, for examining an application for asylum lodged in a Member State, and otherwise to facilitate the application of the Dublin Convention under the conditions set out in this Regulation"" ."	fi
"The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power, the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe, particularly by increasing military budgets. Social Europe, used as a foil by the EU, has simply been eliminated from the agenda. All this does is to legitimise the development, on the European scale, of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers' main claims towards the highest common denominator. This is why I am voting against the report. I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the IGC. I did so because it sums up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency, which is supported by a broad majority in Parliament, of opening up the IGC agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between Member States, large and small, as was originally stated when the Helsinki Council was convened. Unfortunately, in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for revisions to the Treaty on European Union, nothing has so far been stated about the need to review Article 7, which deals with suspending a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the ""founding"" principles of the Union, as laid down in Article 6. As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated, the Union has the right to protect itself. Nevertheless, the legal mechanisms that exist in the Treaty are weak, difficult to apply politically and legally, do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance. Suspending a state is just such a process, and is to be condemned. I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda, and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the Treaties. We feel that at present the central issues about convening an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda. They are also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulating proposals for new issues to be covered, and more important than the controversy over the extent of Parliament' s participation in it. We feel that these issues result from the IGC' s appropriateness and its objectives, as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there. We have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged. This relates in particular to the intended agenda, particularly as regards the Amsterdam leftovers, which suggests that unacceptable inner cabinets will be created in the future. This also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars, which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union."	el
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves. Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster. Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved. Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport. This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport. But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission. As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem. I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. Transport of dangerous goods by road The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)]. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation. Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive. In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments. I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job. In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today. Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty. The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community. It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas. The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers. The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own. In so doing, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure. The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.	de
I am referring to the position the Austrian Government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission' s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives. One applies to the principle of treating people equally, without differentiating on the grounds of race or ethnic origin. The other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin, religion, handicap or sexual persuasion. These are significant texts, adopted in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty, which gave the Community jurisdiction to fight discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, sex etc. Lastly, I would like to assure you, Mr Ford, that the Commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities, should it prove necessary. I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question. But is Commissioner Vitorino aware, not only of Mr Haider's and the Freedom Party's words, but also of their deeds? Mr Haider has actually been in government in the southern province of Carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovene-speaking minority in that region who are Austrian citizens, where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the Roma and immigrant communities. Could the Commissioner answer two questions. Firstly he talked about verification. Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it? Secondly, does he not agree that were the current government, at a national level, to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level, then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6(1) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action? We are not talking about words here. We are talking about deeds by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider. It is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the Commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Member States according to the procedures and standards that are enshrined in Article 6 and justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty. Therefore I am fully confident that the Commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in Austria, as in any other Member State. If any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one Member State occurs, we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly. I also rely not only on the cooperation of the Members of the European Parliament, but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organisations, which have always made an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the Commission. Regarding the situation in Carinthia, we need to look at this in detail. The honourable Member raised the question. The protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the Commission has put before the Council. We should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question. That question calls for reflection, for debate and, if necessary, for action. I sincerely hope that all Member States will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directives that the Commission has presented to the Council to reiterate in clear and concrete terms their approval for the action plan and for the directives and their commitment to fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur. Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino, for your valuable contribution to this Question Time. Second part Questions to Mrs Wallstr√∂m Question No 41 by (H-0021/00): Subject: Surplus electrical and electronic equipment Each year the European Union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment (6 million tonnes' worth in 1998), mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent. The environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances (lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chrome, PVC and halogenated flame retarders). A preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions, the most recent of which dates from July 1999. Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft, which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998?	fi
This would then give us, for Wednesday' s sitting, the two Council statements on the coherence of Union policies with development policy and on the UN 'Human Rights' sitting, followed by the joint debate on Cyprus and then the reports by Mr Swoboda, Mr Corrie, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Kn√∂rr Borr√†s. Is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal? Since no one wishes to speak, I shall put this proposal to the vote. (Parliament gave its assent)Relating to Thursday: President. I have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance. On the subject of human rights, I have received two proposals for additions: one from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party for an item entitled 'Cambodia' and the other from the Group of the Greens, for an item entitled 'Pinochet' . As you know, we can only include five items in the 'Human Rights' section. According to the list given in the final version of the agenda, there are already four items. We can therefore table only one additional item. Who wishes to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to propose the addition of an item on Cambodia? Madam President, it is hugely important to the Liberal Group that we talk about the situation in Cambodia, and that this is done at this particular time, not only on account of the letter which UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, has written to the government in Cambodia, asking it to take steps, at long last, to set up a special tribunal in order to call the leaders of the Khmer Rouge to account, but also because the Hun Sen regime, obviously not content with the attempted assassinations of the leader of the opposition, Mr Sam Raninsy, has now considered that his parliamentary immunity should be lifted to boot, so that he can simply be brought before the court. The international community has asked for justification for what is happening in Cambodia. After all, we approved the elections in Cambodia, in what was one of the biggest fiascos on the electoral observation front. Only this Parliament has emerged with some of its credit intact. I think that we, as a Parliament, even now have to assume our responsibility and speak out on the situation in Cambodia. (Parliament gave its assent) President. The item on Cambodia is therefore added to the 'Human Rights' section. This renders the proposed item on Pinochet null and void. In addition, I have received some proposals for subjects to be included in the topical and urgent debate. Here we are not adding any more sub-items under the 'Human Rights' heading, we are introducing new items. There are three proposals: one proposal from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left to add an item entitled, 'Moratorium on the death penalty in the United States and the case of Betty Beets' ; a second proposal from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to add an item entitled, 'The Pinochet affair' ; and a third from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for the inclusion of a new point, 'Environmental disaster in the Danube' . In view of the time available given that, as you know, we have a Commission statement on the restructuring of business and that the current list already includes two items, we can only add two additional items. I shall take the proposal from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left first. (Parliament rejected the proposal) President. We will now take the proposal from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. Is there anyone to speak in favour of this proposal? Madam President, it is remarkable that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet, despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued. Since the Belgian Government' s appeal to a higher court was declared admissible last week and since the decision has essentially not yet been taken, it is important for Parliament to at last give out a strong message, a message which should signify that nobody can escape a just trial. It is inconceivable that the European Parliament, which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights, should fail to adopt a clear stance on this. Madam President, this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time. Firstly, the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet, but, furthermore, there are certain questions to be borne in mind. The first is that this matter is sub judice in several European countries, and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system.	fi
Of course, we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content, but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam, and even extending them. I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that.  I also welcome the White Paper. But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France's refusal to lift the ban? You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting. Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance, similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment? Mr President, you said during last week' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery was. For example, the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters. It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather, publish and coordinate data, make recommendations for improved food safety, and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers. All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union. I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location? In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time. In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board. You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board. This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months. I envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders. Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September. We have not done that yet but it will be done in September. I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work. That would erode the independence of the scientific advice. But it would have an overall remit, particularly, for instance, in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research. Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that. That is an issue for consideration and discussion. There may be a number of views on that. Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board. Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament, through nominees or even MEPs themselves, were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated. It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out. Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity. I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile. It must be visible. It must be known. Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority. The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known, who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food, particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition, diet and such issues, so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority. They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority. It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous. It must be visible. I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority. Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth.	fi
I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets, compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool. The programme which I shall present for the fifth women' s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring. Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned, the same cannot be said for the private sector. My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light. There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2% of the directors and managers are women. Nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision-making centres. Here too, specific efforts will be made of course; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature, but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices; in all cases, my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results. As you know, Europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within. A decision has already been taken on quotas of 40% for each sex on all teams and on all research and technological development programmes. It was approved by the House in May 1999, when the need for women in research and technology was stressed. We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together, as can be seen from the reform of the Commission, to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission. Ladies and gentlemen, there are often objections, crypto-progressive objections, as to whether there should be a binding undertaking on the representation of women at the centres of power. No one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say. And at the level of the European Union, the question of whether the 15 Member States need to be represented on every committee will never be asked. Why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population. I should like to be absolutely categorical. There should be no reservation, no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power. (Applause) Women make up half the population, half the strength of the planet. Excluding women from the centres of power means, first, democratic failure and, secondly, under-exploitation of human resources. We face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles. I am optimistic that we shall succeed. The bet before us is a bet with time. Future generations of women must not be sidelined. If need be, we must use all possible means to force the situation. (Applause) Mr President, firstly I must thank Mrs Bel√©m Roseira for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject. I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words. The various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under-represented in the decision-making process, in both the political and the economic and social spheres. Nobody nowadays disputes that women should participate in political life, in the parties and in the institutions but it is not easy to agree on how this participation should be achieved. The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work. This involves both equality in accessing work, which implies equality in training, and equal pay for the same work, so often defended and yet far from being achieved. We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole. Women always have a different viewpoint from men. This serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us, who are dedicated to active politics, undertake to solve.	fi
This service must therefore be kept public. This is the only way to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators. However, further to the directive on common rules for Community postal services, the Commission has undertaken studies which have not been forwarded to the European Parliament. We are therefore unaware of the impacts of the directive' s application on either the level of service provided to the people or the current European postal operators in terms of both economics and employment. In our opinion, the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted, including its timetable. Any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications, with the objective always being to guarantee a high-quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to support this proposal on principle while asking right at the outset whether the previous speaker' s statement that on the one hand we need an innovative and highly effective and competitive service while on the other hand this service should be a public service, is not a contradiction in terms. I think ours is a different approach! European policy has liberalised monopoly markets - energy, telecommunications and air transport - and the target, the focus, was always the consumer. The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services. I think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs. He does not need a government to do so, or a parliament, nor does he need a Commission to do so! The postal market is limping along behind and, sadly, we have wasted valuable time here. I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends. I am thinking here of the very sound words of Mr R√ºbig, who also talked about e-commerce. That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges. I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market. It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy. We should seize that opportunity, for the citizen keeps asking, why do we have Europe? These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe. I am glad Mr Monti, the Commissioner for competition, is here today in person, for he is pursuing an excellent policy. And here I want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - Parliament and the Commission must consider where to draw limits to competition. We are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy, and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible.	fr
Commissioner, I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties, but I believe that, it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy, especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition. What is being done may well be very important, but it is still not sufficient. Mr President, we are holding a special debate: on competition policy and state aid, the government' s right and left hand, so to speak. Whilst the EMU criteria are forcing Member States to curb expenditure, the high level of state aid to industry has so far remained in place. This is understandable, because it is highly likely that Member States which start to cut back on state aid will cause companies to leave, with adverse effects on employment. But, at the same time, this is not understandable because bad management and non-viable jobs should not be funded by taxpayers' money. In principle, only horizontal regulations are permissible because they do not distort, or hardly distort, competition. The rapporteur' s Amendments Nos 6 and 7, therefore, deserve our support. Amendments Nos 1 and 5 make reference to the phenomenon of market failure because the market instrument in itself does not result in the ideal society. Vulnerable people find themselves hardest hit. Market forces must be employed in a sophisticated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies. If this comes to nothing, then the government has to step in. The Commission' s White Paper on modernising competition policy seems more like a discussion paper. The plea in favour of decentralisation in order to lighten the load within the Directorate-General on Competition is a kind gesture, but the way in which the Commission would like to carry this through would lead to the judiciary being stretched. This would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry. Does the pressure of work within the Commission really decrease when national judges are required to report to the Commission? What is the Council' s opinion on this and is the Commissioner prepared to completely reconsider these points? Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave. It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that. It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense. I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views. I also assume that you, Commissioner, want to honour the reputation of, and the work put in by, your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective. I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner, but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless. Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application. In general, I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market. The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application. It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way. The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities. But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward. So, I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible. Secondly, I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty. Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern. This instrument will fall by the wayside in future. In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next? Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy. I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection, as is already the case, one has got to admit, within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector.	fi
Unfortunately, and as everyone recognised during the military action in Kosovo, there were civilian sectors, and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public, and even inhabited areas, which were directly affected by NATO air attacks. This is generally recognised and this happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war was not a clean war, nor a model war, but a war based on the art of the possible. And, above all, it was a necessary war, and it was not only about what was possible, it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community. Mr Marset Campos, regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight, if you take no action yourself - I believe that, if we look at what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to, and the continuation of that impunity, then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light. Question No 4 by (H-0028/00): Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Council taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia? Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia? Mr President, I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer. Nevertheless, I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when, ultimately, there is in fact a major tripartite relationship. We provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place, in order to help Armenia, and still the aid cannot come into play because Turkey has imposed an economic blockade, and so many things cannot get through to the Armenians at all. We are negotiating with Turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the Union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a Member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours. Can you not exert greater influence over Turkey, so as to enable there to be peaceful developments in this region, and so as to enable Armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front? - (PT) Mrs Schleicher, you are quite right to say that we should use our relationship with Turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and, particularly, that it becomes part of the solution rather than part of the problem. We feel that precisely because Turkey has embarked on a new type of relationship with the European Union, and also because Turkey now has to respond to the European Union' s positions on common foreign and security policy issues, we will, to be frank, be testing Turkey' s will as regards the European Union' s priorities in its foreign relations.	fr
Of course we have pondered this issue, and we are still studying it extremely carefully, and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced. At the end of the day, I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified. The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy. The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission' s activities, but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers. The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term, used by Mrs Randzio-Plath, and, moreover, I fully agree with it - of European competition culture. So, the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive, and they are certainly not all the same. The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned, permitting greater use of Community law, which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply. Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation, not renationalisation, of competition law. The question of consistent application: the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind, but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated. As with many other provisions of the Treaty, Articles 81(1) and 82 have, after all, been applied for decades by national authorities and judges, and I do not feel that this has created serious problems. In a directly applicable exception system, consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules. The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework, both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice. Secondly, we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes, and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation. In this respect, I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen and Mr Huhne of monitoring implementation. This then is the idea of monitoring implementation. I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up. Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on, it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts. That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application. This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns, Mrs Peijs. Concerning Mr Evans' point regarding the implications for businesses, it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted. The purpose of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources. We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business. We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation.	fr
"I am sure that your answer to this will be ""yes"" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be? My next question, Mrs Wallstr√∂m, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example? Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation? In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached? . Thank you very much, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, for these questions. Of course, this is shared by the whole Commission. This is a common communication which was written by the three of us, David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen and myself, but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today. It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission. So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document. Yes, I would say we already use this way of working with different, difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example. And, I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle. We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas. It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health. So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it. Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence. Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power. We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for? The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists. I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority? How would you describe this? What establishes a recognised minority? If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision? The Commission? The Council? And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this? What is the role of the scientific committees? What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up? Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way? These are my three questions. . Yes, Mr President, that is true. There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions. Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers? Well, that depends on who the legislators are. This is part of risk management."	de
That would be good internationalism as opposed to the bad internationalism, as practised with the free exchange areas and other false friends of the OECD. Mr President, Commissioner, to be able to adopt a credible fisheries policy, the Commission needs comprehensive and reliable data on fish stocks and fisheries fleets at its disposal. The Commission relies on the Member States for the collation of this data. A Community framework for the collation of this data adds some structure and improves accessibility for the purpose of scientific evaluation. The question, however, is whether or not the Member States would be prepared, under this new regime, to make the necessary data available at the requested time. Effective sanctions and/or incentives, which aim to encourage Member States to adopt a more serious approach, are lacking from the Commission' s proposal. Moreover, can we rely sufficiently on this information? How reliable is fishing data, as long as there are still large amounts of fish being caught illegally, as British fisherman David Cox recently admitted in Fishing News? And what should we make of the data on fleet capacity? Further to the Court of Auditor' s criticism, in January this Parliament adopted my amendment to the Cunha report with a large majority. The amendment requests independent verification of fleet capacity data. I would like to know from the Commission how it has processed this recommendation, which is also endorsed by the Advisory Committee. Finally, radical decisions are sometimes mainly based on opinions presented by biologists. We therefore have everything to gain from improving the accuracy of biological predictions, for example by certifying the drafting of these opinions. Furthermore, the Commission must provide sufficient financial means for the inspection of stock levels. It is also recommended that more use be made of the expertise and experience gathered by fishermen when biological opinions are drafted. The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union. They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing. The recent decisions on the cod quota for the Irish Sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the Northern Ireland fishing industry. I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland, a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue. The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves, which have been totally rejected out of hand, for the conservation of their own fish stocks, then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard. At a recent visit in Brussels these fishermen' s representatives, duly accredited, travelled from Northern Ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared. That is scandalous, their case ought to be heard. It should be put on record, and I want to put it on record today. I sat in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the Irish Sea and at that very time haddock had a special, spectacular increase of breeding in the Irish Sea so the scientists can be wrong. As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ruination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union. Mr President, Mrs Attwooll' s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the Member States. This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002. However, the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the Commission' s proposal. This has happened, as previously mentioned, with the MAGPs. These have seriously prejudiced the countries which have strictly complied with them and provided the corresponding data to the Commission, compared with other countries which have failed to comply or simply not provided the data.	fi
We will be bringing forward to the Council before Lisbon our proposals on a rapid reaction facility so that we can provide assistance where it is required, not in months or years, but in days or weeks. We are establishing a Commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative' s policy unit. Additionally, and this is for me the most important area of all, an area where we are breaking new ground, we will, soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility, be bringing forward proposals as well on non-military headline goals. It is, I repeat, breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in Kosovo, policing elsewhere, is the most dramatic and obvious example. It is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner. I grew up as a kid hoping I would be allowed to stay up on Saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community policeman called Dixon of Dock Green. I have just been writing a report before I came to this job, and writing a very good report, just to respond to my honourable friend, on policing in part of my own country. I remember talking about community policing to some American police experts and saying 'What in your view is the ideal community police officer' and the reply was 'a black grandmother' . But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo. We have armed forces, we have all got experience of training community police officers. What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing. We need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well. That is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the European Union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences. So again, rhetoric and reality. Now Mr Titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate. One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject. But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon. I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights, between neglecting habeas corpus, between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance, between tyranny and between environmental degradation. All those things come together. We talk about the complexities of our eco-system but there is an eco-system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like Mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the Balkans as well.	el
In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal. In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister. This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm. In October, a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid. The pattern of intimidation is clear. There is more going on in Cambodia: prisoners are being tortured, the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children, and people are held on remand to an excessive degree. All this is happening on a daily basis. Even more serious is the government' s refusal to bring the leaders of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal. It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased. The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union' s relations with Cambodia. Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected. Living examples of this have been the Pinochet-Ugarten case, Kosovo and, in milder form in our own Union, the debate surrounding the government decision in Austria. This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice. At the same time, the struggle against impunity is under threat. The situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow. . Mr President, we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday. I am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge. First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails. Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation. In particular we support the development of a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society. Our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and, in particular, to try to build confidence between the various communities.	fr
B5-0173/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sj√∂stedt on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, B5-0179/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a Romanian goldmine into the Lepos, Somes, Tisza and Danube Rivers. Mr President, we debated the framework directive on water this week, and the disaster in Romania has demonstrated once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water. This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union. We are delighted with the pledge that EU aid will be used to clean the rivers, and at least as important is the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in Romania and, more generally, in Central and Eastern Europe. We therefore welcome Commissioner Wallstr√∂m' s brief visit, for it can contribute to this awareness. After all, this is a candidate country we are talking about, and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the EU environmental rules in time. The polluter ought to pay. I wonder whether the European Union can recoup this kind of cost from the environmental cowboys who appear in the so-called 'Wild East' , making use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place. I would be in favour of its doing so. Mr President, Commissioner, there has been one ecological disaster after another and, unfortunately, they are all similar. Once again, there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe. The delta of the Danube is in danger. As in Spain in April 1998, as in Brittany and the Vend√©e since last December, once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat. The European Parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger, which threatens our environment, upsets our ecosystem and again weakens our populations. This new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries. The authorities in these counties, which are still very frail from an environmental point of view, need to overcome numerous obstacles. First, they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites; then they need to have suitable technical means of curbing and containing this type of pollution and, finally, they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites. Today, the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted, which is why the European Union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with Community environmental protection standards. But, over and above that, it is the technologies and the means used to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which are being called into question.	fr
The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information. For this reason, the draft reform, which has been drawn up by the rapporteur, Vice-President Marinho, is to be welcomed. It is true that it is a stopgap solution, but we must rely on stopgap solutions because, at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference. We have to offer solutions which, while provisional, help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice. I would like to make two observations during this intervention, which stem from the report itself, given this Parliament' s obligation, in accordance with the Treaty, to produce a very succinct report, which does not go into depth. These are two of Vice-President Marinho' s ideas and, I believe, they are seconded by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance, and that they should be given one more r√©f√©rendaire. The second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated. At the moment, the Court of First Instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated. According to the Treaty, one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language. Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference, let us consider just two points. The first concerns this Parliament. I believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice, even in the appointment of judges. Above all, we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice, hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations, in other words, its resources. We wish to see its competences extended, especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible options, certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens. And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days. Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report. It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency. Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice. The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT. The decision could have huge implications for our local economy. Secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age. These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe' s system of justice. Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy. This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect, but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court. Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references. This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff, rather of the Court' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union. The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative, but Europe is a legal construction, its courts are central to its proper functioning. In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system. Otherwise we will all, as elected representatives, be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice. Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report. I also fully endorse his findings, in which, in particular, he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service. In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve.	fi
It must, however, be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds, whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority. And indeed, on the subject of the balance of rural society, let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture. At this stage, I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas, in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions. In any event, I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter. Before concluding, I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France, Austria and Germany, in particular, in the last few weeks, and at the same time we shall once again be discussing, together with my fellow Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France. I shall therefore reserve the right, if you permit, sir, to give you my own opinion, which, to a great extent, matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using Objective 2. I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow. We shall then have an appropriate tool for working, particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms. Indeed, this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms. In conclusion, with thanks for your understanding, Mr President, I should like to thank you, Mrs Schroedter, for the quality of your work and that of the committee, and to tell you that I am very pleased, apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines. We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view. I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines, which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes. This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes. I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions, at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken, good joint working practice, which is, Mr Hatzidakis, backed up by something I am very attentive to: observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)]. Mr President, Commissioner, this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report. I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches. The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions. In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	fi
These inspections may be carried out by the roadside, in ports and in other places where vehicles park, or, as is more frequent in the case of public service vehicles, on the operator's premises. In fact, several States already apply this type of inspection, the so-called 'roadside inspections' , in the manner laid down in the directive, that is, in a somewhat unexpected manner. This may in fact be the best way to effectively monitor the state of the vehicles in circulation on our roads. I would like to say that the Commission is aware that Parliament is concerned that this proposal might lead to discrimination against certain transport contractors, or lorries from certain countries or even certain makes of vehicle, and that the intention of the principal recommendation of the rapporteur is for the fines imposed on operators by the Member States to be harmonised as a condition of application of the directive. We share this concern, but we consider that Amendment No 2 is too drastic and, in this respect, we would support Amendment No 3 which encompasses the spirit we are all aiming for, and which, at the same time, offers the necessary flexibility. We also accept Amendment No 1, and I would like to refer to what Mr Bouwman said. In fact, we are tremendously concerned by the fact that vehicles are being driven in the Union by drivers from third countries, and in particular from candidate countries, who do not have work contracts that conform to Community standards, or the standards of any Community country, but simply obey the standards of these third countries, which are often candidates for accession, or sometimes do not even conform to these standards as the corresponding inspections are not carried out by the said third countries. I have therefore written to all the Ministers for Transport of the fifteen countries of the Union to instigate a discussion on the subject, and also to ask for a report on what the situation is in their countries regarding this type of case, and what positive suggestions they can submit so that we can find a solution to this problem, which concerns us greatly, and which could have negative consequences for road safety, which has to be our main concern, and for fair competition, which is also important to us at the Commission. To this end, I hope that we can deal with these matters at the next Transport Council at the end of this month, as well as, as Mr Watts has said, all aspects of road safety in general since the Portuguese Presidency proposes this as one of the key matters of its Presidency. On the basis that great progress has been made in the past few years, I believe that a great deal still remains to be done, as the death of 42 000 - 43 000 European citizens on the roads is too high a figure and there is still an effort to be made. But I would like to say that, with regard to the problem of drivers from third countries, I hope that before the end of the month we shall have a response, and we shall, in any case, handle this within the Council. And, in response to some questions or initiatives, I shall be able to reply here in Parliament, either during the plenary session or in committee, and, if not, I hope in any case that we shall shortly be able to make a concrete proposal that enables us, truly and effectively, to combat this type of abuse.	de
We shall be monitoring each Commissioner carefully, so the other Commissioners have now been forewarned. Thank you for your reply. I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields. I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes. Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work. I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes. This is a crucial goal. In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required. . (SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do. In the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General, issues of equality play a very important role. For example, I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission. If we are to be able to motivate everybody, I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or, if you prefer, from the bottom up. My impression of environment-related work, broadly speaking, is that in many instances it is dominated by women. This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field. I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention, but there is certainly room for improvement. I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up. I hope that this will be of benefit. Question No 43 by (H-0045/00):  Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission's insistence. What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation. How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area? Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area? The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour, but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member.	el
Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country. Then, and only then, might you consider if human rights are affected. Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then, Madame President and only then, may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union. Madam President, as a representative of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria. My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one' s own past, and the stability of democracy. Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly. The refusal of our government, down through the years, to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War, together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour, have done a great deal to bolster this negative image. This FP√ñ has now entered into a coalition with the √ñVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office. This is the citizen of a state' s prerogative, for it is the founding principle of a democracy. When the talks between the SP√ñ and √ñVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FP√ñ for their support. We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here! When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day. The FP√ñ party is established in Austria' s political landscape. The head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments. What many Austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind, and why the campaign did not begin until the Freedom Party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the SP√ñ? There is prejudice at work here, which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle. I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda, as, for example, the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust. Shame on you Mr Bertinotti! You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda. Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist! On the contrary, you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did. Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices, you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose. The attacks against Austria' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people.	de
We cannot afford to waste time. It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one. In my opinion, the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then. It is a question of doing what is technically possible; obviously it is not possible to do anymore, but we must be sufficiently ambitious. I would like to comment on one issue, which was spoken about earlier. I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water. This is not merely a problem for Spain; it is one for the Nordic countries, and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters, when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive. Mr President, Madam Commissioner, congratulations, Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work. Water and air surround us everywhere. We share them with everyone on this earth. Water is a prerequisite for human life. And there are more and more of us in the world. Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal. Nothing could be further from the truth! It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so, too, the conditions for life. It is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources. I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order. Mr President, we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann, the targets it sets and the directive under discussion. However, we should look a little more closely at some points. For example, a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes, which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments, and which, of course, are a great risk to ground waters, water tables and surface waters. I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place, the specifications common to us all must be very stringent. But the key issue is, in my opinion, planning how to restore water tables, the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes, which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind. I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding, because, at the end of the day, that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy. Mr President, here we have what is basically a good measure. It sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management. Its aim of good-quality water for drinking, for wildlife, the environment and economic purposes is right. The prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood.	de
"They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner, Mr Antonio Vitorino, and we congratulate them on this as well. Furthermore, they have taken on the task of creating a ""scoreboard"" to verify the progress made in this area at Community level, but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States. We are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decisions, despite the fact that, for this House, the Treaty of Amsterdam included one disappointment: that of delaying, for five years, our role, our ability to participate actively, to democratically control this area of freedom, security and justice, as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice. However, if, on verifying the progress made during 1999, which is within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty, we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out, the scene looks considerably darker, Mr President. It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to, the other begrudges. Despite all the commitments made at the highest level, the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged. Programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or, at least, this Parliament is unable to do so. We have presented the Council with a series of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them. We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament. I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out. There are doubts in my Group and doubts also persist in this House, for example, about something which should be good news: the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework. Schengen has been incorporated, as we said earlier, into the acquis, but it has been done with very little transparency. Not a single piece of information, nor a single consultation, has been addressed to Parliament during this process; neither on the association of the United Kingdom, nor on the incorporation of Greece, nor on the negotiations with Norway and Iceland. The same is true with regard to immigration policy. We have amused ourselves with a pile of reports, but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives; they have disappeared. We hope that 2000 will be the year for action, in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations. We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament. The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union. The Council can act in accordance with Parliament' s decisions, or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project. If it chooses the second approach, it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom, security and justice is built."	de
This will not be a matter of chance, since, let me repeat, I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union. Finally, I should like to make three additional comments, quite briefly, Mr President. Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate. Such dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important. I have said, furthermore, that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments. Tomorrow, I shall be in London. In a fortnight' s time, I shall be in Berlin. In three weeks' time, I shall be in Paris, and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another. I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive, and I should like to thank you for taking it. My second brief comment is to thank the Portuguese Presidency, particularly Mr Seixas da Costa, for his proactive approach. Indeed, the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own: the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency. It will have to initiate these negotiations. We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency, in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000. Not only that a conclusion can be reached, but that a successful conclusion can be reached, which is not necessarily the same thing. Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully. The handover will have been made, but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made, by yourself, Mr President, and by the Portuguese Presidency, are going to be extremely important, as is the nature of this handover. It is all the work which is going to be carried out together, under your guidance particularly, in the course of these few months, which is extremely important. We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion, and indeed great expectations thereof. Portugal is a small country, but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions. After having heard Prime Minister Guterres, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself, I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations. It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months. Finally, let me repeat, we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations. These are difficult subjects, subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain. All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament, Ministers, Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens, to public debate.	el
The report urges Member States most strongly to face up to their responsibilities in full by implementing as soon as possible the inspection measures which, backed up by a system of penalties along the 'polluter pays/polluter cleans' principle, would perhaps make it possible to prevent the recurrence of disasters such as the one which, recently, so scandalously disfigured the French coastline. Recommendation for second reading of the Piecyk report (A5-0040/2000) - (FR) The European Parliament has today expressed its opinion of the proposed directive on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles. It is indeed essential to improve the level of safety and to mitigate the environmental impact of these vehicles, the volume of which is constantly increasing. Setting up random mandatory roadside inspections in order to check their state of repair throughout the year is a pertinent idea, provided that it can be implemented effectively. This proposed directive would be an extremely useful complement to the efforts undertaken in towns and cities, especially in the form of urban transport plans, particularly in the conurbation around Rouen, which is crossed by 5 000 commercial vehicles daily. It is also important, as a matter of urgency, to consider having recourse to alternative means of transport for goods (waterways, railways, etc.) and to consider developing clean vehicles. These are the reasons why, ladies and gentlemen, I supported the proposed directive on the technical roadside inspection of commercial vehicles today. (The sitting was suspended at 12.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) EU Charter of Fundamental Rights  The next item is the report (A5-0064/2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the drafting of a European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. . (IT) Madam President, the European Parliament is at last about to vote on the report, which has taken a great deal of time to prepare, on the drafting of the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I hope that the patient work of the rapporteurs will be rewarded in this Chamber. What I mean to say is that I hope that the damaging amendments made by those who see in the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights an attack on democracy, no less, will be rejected. And yet most of these rights already exist in the European Union as they are present in the Treaties, in the European Convention on Human Rights, in the institutional traditions common to the Member States and in the international conventions to which they all subscribe. What is there to fear in a Charter of Fundamental Rights? This is only the formal ratification, the coherent expression of those sacrosanct individual rights, without which democracy would be reduced to a kingdom where the force of numerical strength reigns and the authorities may do as they please. The European Union means the peaceful, supportive coexistence of different peoples and cultures, based on its tradition of respect for the rights of individuals. The Charter will become a catalogue of shared principles which define Europe' s identity before the world, an identity which is not based on blood ties, ethnic origin or national allegiance, but, indeed, on common values. In the careful recognition of common rights, there will have to be acknowledgement of those fundamental social rights which are intrinsically no different from the other, more obvious rights, such as the right of freedom to join a trade union, the right to fundamental health and safety in the workplace and training rights, which have never been so essential for growth, employment and competitiveness in the global market as they are now.	el
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union. We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear. I also believe that we should not underestimate, and this is a question that I put to you, the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries. We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community. Today, they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy, and I believe that they are working with that in mind. Finally, with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo. Without this status, there will only be instability, murders, provocation by Belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the European Union should come to a decision on this matter. Finally, I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives, as we say in common parlance, are getting a bit much. I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice, for example. Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates, we have still not had a trial, and we still do not know what is happening. As far as tourism is concerned, there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium, for example. So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him, which is what I hope will happen. Mr President, first of all, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Solana on this first day of March, for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on European security and defence policy. But I do wonder what his own view is on this. According to the documents, cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful. You said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch. You have to admit, it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks. But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light? I - and I believe many with me in Parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent. Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO.	fr
Are you of the opinion that the Commission can block entire approvals for plans, or is it just payment of funds for individual projects? That was not at all clear. Let me say two or three things. Firstly, I think that Community law must be seen as a whole. Community law provides that if a Member State fails to implement legislation, or implements it incorrectly, the State will be brought to justice. You should do that! You should not try to achieve through the back door, through the non-payment of money, what you are unable to achieve through legal action and orderly process. This is something which I do not think is quite right. If you are saying that Member States are contravening Community law, breaching Community law, then bring these Member States to justice! But to fail to do this in favour of the back-door approach of trying to stop the payment of money in order to indirectly force the hand of the Member States is something that I quite simply consider to be wrong and even cowardly! Secondly, Commissioner, the Structural Funds are not given out to damage the countryside. They are given out to create jobs and to kick-start the regions. We must not therefore, in order to achieve another objective, obstruct or abandon the original aim of supporting disadvantaged areas. What is more, it should not be the case that one Commissioner sets himself up as some sort of Supreme Commissioner who can then dictate to the other. None of us want anything for the environment to be left undone. But it isn' t on, Mr President, Commissioner, that regions might suffer because Member States are failing in their duties! Here too we must watch out! - (PT) Mr President, following the words of my colleagues which prove how necessary the resolution we are discussing actually is, I should like to use my speaking time to condemn two particularly damaging cases which affect my country, Galicia, but which could equally be taking place in other European countries. In Pontevedra, practically within the city limits, and occupying a particularly sought-after location by the sea, the huge industrial chemicals complex built by the public companies ENCE and ELNOSA, which produce cellulose pulp and chlorine, is contaminating water and air with the connivance of the Galician and Spanish authorities and in spite of the continuing protests of the local population. In Vila Garcia de Arousa, repositories have been installed in a wharf financed by the ERDF to hold 80 000 cubic metres of hydrocarbons, which pose a serious threat to fishing and related activities which provide jobs for 18 000 people, if these hydrocarbons are handled on a regular basis or if accidents with transporting vessels occur. Mr President, I believe the issue of ensuring integrated and correct implementation of the Community' s environmental policy is perhaps the greatest challenge facing the Member States today. Unfortunately, however, the requirements of environmental policy are not being respected and are not being properly incorporated when programmes and projects are formulated and approved in the Member States. The problem is in fact much worse; in addition to the fact that environmental legislation is being contravened in projects and programmes which have received Community approval and funding, it is also being contravened during the implementation of projects and programmes in receipt of private or national funding. I should just like to draw your attention to paragraph b and point 3 and 8 of the resolution which takes account of precisely this issue. It is absurd for EU environmental legislation not to be applied or respected for all projects in the Member States, irrespective of whether they require Community or some other type of funding. We should make it quite clear to countries which contravene environmental legislation that the Commission, which is the guardian of primary and secondary Community law, will ensure that the environment is not damaged when projects are constructed. This flagrant violation of our basic environmental laws must not be allowed to continue. We need, once and for all, to come out and say what is happening in the Member States, because transparency, courage and the truth are the best policy. And the truth is that the directives for the Natura 2000 network have been inadequately implemented both in my country and in other Member States.	fi
As these transactions are generally not subject to prudential control, the risks are all the more obvious. The Socialist Group has tabled amendments proposing both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clauses in order to contain the risks to investors. By adopting these amendments, Parliament will allow recourse to OTC derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors. Mr President, there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance. This principle should not only guide the public sector, it should also guide the private sector, especially financial undertakings. Mr President, our objective in setting a framework for unit trusts and other UCTIS is to secure the highest possible safe return for our savers, which is why I want to address the issue of derivatives in my remarks today. I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure, safer, higher returns. Despite their image of danger, derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance. A contract that, for example, pays a substantial sum if, say, the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index falls, causes an extra payment by the investor if the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index rises. Is this speculative? Not at all. Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident: they have good management, good prospects and they are good investments. Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse, as it did in 1987. You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash, but that would be to waste your research into the winners. It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall. The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls. But even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheaper, perhaps insuring you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index, you would still have the portfolio and the shares, but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse. In exchange, you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets. In this case, which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers, you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk. That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund. History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation. Heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers. Pension funds which suffered from rules on where they could and could not invest, as required by of our government bonds, made returns of 5.2% a year, barely half the 9.5% annual returns made by free funds between 1984 and 1996. These are of course the returns after deducting all losses. Do not confuse a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off. This is what we should be concerned about here today. Mr President, the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in Europe, including the most sophisticated forms of investment. We do not, in principle, oppose this industry. However, unlike Mr Christopher Huhne, we feel that a continent which has proved incapable of controlling its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may, in time, provoke the same type of crisis. We shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group. But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole. We shall also vote in the future against any proposals to deregulate the financial markets and we call on all the other political groups to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income is finally harmonised. For years certain countries, including Great Britain, have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens.	fi
You have the fine, charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections, or rather the turnout at the next European elections. When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say? Mr Prodi, what can I say; what is there that is new? There is nothing new in your work programme. You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year' s work programme. Does that give me hope for the year 2000? No, it does not! In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever. You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas. Have you done so, Mr Prodi; have you even read your work programme for the year? No, you have not done so. You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement, despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement. Nor have you integrated it into economic policy, competition or the internal market. You have not integrated it anywhere. You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure. You said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure; no, Mr Prodi, we need, at long last, to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored. You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation. Mr Prodi, you do not know what you are talking about. The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world. Where it falls short, what is missing, is transposition in the Member States and monitoring. It is time you took your job seriously, it is time for you, as President of the Commission, to box the Member States on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties. It is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day' s work to be done. That is what we expect of you in the next five years. . (ES) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, as chairman of this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries, Mr Prodi, you are not making things easy for me at all. I feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us. The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change. I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing, since the silence of your programme, with regard to fishing, is deafening. Not a single line, nor a single word, refers to fishing or the CFP. I am not asking for details or specific points, but I believe that a mention was required. How could you completely ignore a common - I repeat; common - policy with such an economic, social and regional impact, and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe?	de
"We should also have the humility to recognise that, if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House, so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were. There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this. When there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future, we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance. There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission. We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships. Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday, I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly. That is something for which I have a deep appreciation. I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions. It should not be dramatised into something more than that. Thank you very much, Mr Cox. I understand what you are saying. We have taken note of this. Mr President, concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business, we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today's agenda. However, it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on. It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today's agenda. Mr Wynn, that makes sense. The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda. Mr President, regarding Mrs Lynne's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building, I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower. This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong. I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly, but this is a serious problem. Mrs Ahern, we have taken note of this. I would ask you to bring this specific case, which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor, to the attention of the Quaestors, who are, in fact, responsible for the matter. We will also pass this on to our services, however. Thank you very much. (The Minutes were approved) Reform of European competition policy The next item is the joint debate on the following reports: A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty [COM(1999) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)]; A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy 1998 [SEK(1999) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)]; A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors. [COM(1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)] (Report 1995-1997); A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No. 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code). [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)]. Mr President, Commissioner, today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union' s competition policy. We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe. I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term ""modernisation"" to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression ""retrograde step"" . However, we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998, and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter."	fi
We need to be able to go back with a proper answer. The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many. We are right to include this in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds, even thousands of Flora Brovinas out there. I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners. The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo. Mr President, in the present joint draft resolution, paragraph 10 urges the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the UN police units. This request is fully in line with the vision held by the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo, Mr Bernard Kouchner. In order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo, he needs, by his own reckoning, at least 6 000 foreign police officers. The UN, however, have pledged to dispatch a police force of 4 800. To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal. Moreover, half of this group is from the United States and Germany. It is logical that the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation, especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region. What is disconcerting, however, is Mr Kouchner' s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days. Paris is leaving its fellow-countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen, not more than 37, in the crisis region. For this hardly honourable position, Mr Kouchner blames none other than the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Chev√®nement. According to Mr Kouchner, the Minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the French police officials on ideological grounds. I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome. Press freedom in Angola Mr President, I do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity. On the question of Angola, I think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last. It would be the first in a long time. So I welcome it as such. I think that the European Union and the western world in general has had Mr Savimbi in their crossfire for some time now, with no discrimination whatsoever, but corruption is now so rife in Mr Dos Santos' s regime that even his long-standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything. So I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter, especially the worrying things which we are discussing, particularly logistics support for the information services by the United States and Great Britain, generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely 'spicy' matters which we need to go into.	fr
Instead, you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the Member States. Mr President, Commissioner, I have the feeling that some of the previous speakers have not read the 1999 annual report on the Union economy in its entirety and have made a conscious decision not to listen to my Group' s spokesman, Karl von Wogau, for the document that we are debating today, and which has had a report written on it, points to the fact that the introduction of the euro has been a success. It points to the problems experienced in 1999, when, notwithstanding the problems, there was currency and price stability, increased employment, the beginnings of a period of upturn, and it was possible to make a start on reducing unemployment. In terms of outlook, the document points to an upswing, to long-term prospects and the measures required to achieve this, which Karl von Wogau then proceeded to enlarge upon. I am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one, for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy. We want to continue along the successful European path to growth and employment and a functioning internal market, to hasten our progress and supplement this with the necessary measures. The left-wing of this House does not want to continue along this path, rather it makes dramatic statements such as: what we need is state intervention, not the extension and consolidation of the market economy. State intervention has always led to a high level of debt, and a higher level of debt has always damaged growth and employment, as well as social justice. That is what the debate we are having is all about, on the subject of which I have this to say to you: we need more freedom and less state intervention. It is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment. Mr President, the economic situation of the European Union from the viewpoint of the workers is eighteen million unemployed people, it is the generalisation of insecurity, of low wages, of deteriorating working conditions. The Commission has the cynicism to consider wage restraint as a positive factor, whereas in France alone, over three million workers receive a salary that is close to the poverty line and they barely survive any better than the other three million people kept unemployed by an insane economy. But you never speak of restraining the income of shareholders that is infinitely higher from the outset and which increases shockingly every year. What you have as a result are all these major trusts that cut jobs while their profits are high, and which often make staff redundant simply to make their share price rise on the stock market. Eleven thousand job losses at Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, twenty two thousand at Unilever, ten thousand at ABB/Alsthom Power, not to mention all the others. The economic growth on which you pride yourself only benefits a fortunate minority, the owners and shareholders of the large industrial and banking groups. But beware of the backlash from the workers and the unemployed, who we keep telling that everything is getting better and better while they find that their lives are not improving but, on the contrary, are getting worse.	el
Mr President, firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach. I think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage. This did not really happen for the Treaty of Amsterdam or the Treaty of Maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust. I have two questions. Firstly, you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission. Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well, that is to say via the television and Internet? My second question is of a critical nature. The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency. If I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands, then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model, and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands. My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this. Mrs Maij-Weggen, given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC, it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now. The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible. The documents will in the main be open working documents. Although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media, I am committed, as I must be at this stage, to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission' s viewpoint. I can confirm, and thank you for having asked me about this, that we will use all the most modern means, television in particular, to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe. We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums. The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised. These are the modern means to be used. However, I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people. Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal, I want a Commissioner, when he can, an MEP, a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe. I have evidence that this is possible. The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions. Although this may seem rather egotistical, I want the Commission, in the minds of the people, to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible. Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say. I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire, a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding.	el
We are concerned about stability on the financial markets, not for the sake of the financial markets, but because this has to do with own growth, our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union. We must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past. We have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions, but so far we have had no working set of rules, as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the Asian and Latin American crises. It is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information. It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is. We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice. At a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout Europe and internationally, we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short-term financial transactions. I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the Commission, so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achieves real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure. This is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal. Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which, although it does not mention it in the text, appears to be an attempt to revive, as the introduction has done, the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by Mr Tobin, which our Group opposed, clearly and totally, during the last legislature, with a series of arguments clearly and coherently expressed by our President, Mr Cox. I will have to repeat these arguments, modestly, in this intervention, because the same issue has arisen once again. We do not agree with this type of tax because its application, in the event that it could happen, would not achieve the aims which Mr Tobin presented at the time and which the Left in this House wishes to revive. Firstly, there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets. On the contrary, since it is certain that not all countries would accept it, we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility, instability, insecurity, opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level. Furthermore, the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity, when we consider their application in practice, that it appears simply impossible.	fr
Will the new text at least allow the consumer to easily distinguish between true and imitation chocolate? The answer is no because the text of the directive is dishonest. It specifies the option of introducing into the chocolate manufacturing process an extremely precise percentage of 5% of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter, whereas everyone knows that we do not have a reliable method of analysis allowing this percentage to be verified. The Commission is therefore setting a percentage which it knows is unverifiable. This is deceitful. The text also contains dishonest provisions in terms of labelling. On Mr Lannoye' s initiative, this House rightly adopted at first reading an amendment specifying the obligation to place, on the front of the product, clearly legible wording indicating the presence of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter. As this amendment was not retained by the Council, the consumer will not be correctly informed. In all countries and for all consumers with a taste for real chocolate, the name 'chocolate' can now legally cover a completely different product. Through a Community mechanism which is constantly diluting everyone' s responsibility, the definition of one of our basic foodstuffs is being changed, solely for the purpose of allowing a few multinationals to maximise their profits. Chocolate lovers, religiously savour your next Easter eggs! This will be the last time you can be sure that they have been made with real pre-harmonisation chocolate. What will be next after chocolate? When labelling comes in the door, sense flies out the window... This is a distinctive label used throughout Europe which we want to imbue with renewed vigour. Like the French NF Environnement mark, this label is voluntary which means that it is up to manufacturers to apply for it. It is based on the principle of a global approach which takes account of the whole life cycle of the product. However, we must not cast aside all the national logos. Consumers and buyers have their own codes and have built up their confidence on the logos which they know. Any attempt to replace the national logos would end up once again confusing the people of Europe who are lost among a forest of markings including lists of ingredients, quality labels, logos and references to regions. You could almost imagine yourself faced with a bar of chocolate! As our main goal is to help SMEs gain access to these essential Community eco-labels, we support the rapporteur. - Madam President, I wholeheartedly support Europe's moves to become an eco-friendly continent. This measure is yet further proof of the EU's commitment to greening up its act. Since 1992, the Euro-Flower logo has become a hallmark of environmentally-friendly products, ranging from washing machines to writing paper. However, consumers' enthusiasm for green goods has yet to be matched by industry. The measures contained in this 3-year strategy, however, should hopefully bring manufacturers on board. In the fight to clean up our planet, Britain's Labour Government has, of course, been at the forefront. At Kyoto, for example, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott secured, against the odds, an agreement to cut global emissions. Britain is already well on the way to achieving its target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by 2010. Not content with that, the Government has recently raised the target to 60-70% by 2050. This House should challenge other Member States to match Britain's example. They will get their chance to pick up the gauntlet at the forthcoming Kyoto follow-up Conference in The Hague this November. Of course, protecting the planet means much more than just cleaning up the atmosphere. It means protecting the natural environment on the ground too. Again, Britain's Labour Government is leading the way. Its recent Wildlife Bill, for example, will give greater protection to endangered species than ever before. Furthermore, 'right to roam' legislation will give the British public the freedom to enjoy and appreciate our beautiful countryside. Madam President, coherent action is urgently required at local, national and European levels to clean up our land, sea and air.	fi
"Even if one cannot but applaud the decision to adopt specific measures to eradicate all forms of discrimination on the labour market, which might affect asylum seekers whom life has already, by definition, treated badly, we still need to keep a legal conception of this notion: to put it plainly, where there is every reason to help asylum seekers who follow the correct procedure and are duly recognised as such, the same does not apply to the numerous categories listed in the report, namely applicants, those under temporary protection and those denied refugee status and threatened with repatriation, for whom the report makes provision for identical assistance. There is a risk that the so-called aid measures provided for in the report will spread insidiously and with disastrous results: asylum seekers, of course, plus asylum seekers under temporary protection while their applications are being processed and asylum seekers whose applications have been rejected and who are threatened with expulsion should all, according to the report, be able to benefit from this set of measures, whereas their very status - after all, what is an asylum seeker who has been refused refugee status and who is threatened with expulsion if not an illegal immigrant - should, at least for the last category, exclude them from a policy to integrate them into a Community which does not acknowledge their presence in its midst as legal or legitimate. Whether we like it or not, a signal of this sort would be a fearful invitation to immigrants who, merely by applying for refugee status, irrespective of whether or not it is granted, would be able to qualify for a range of aid measures designed to help them integrate permanently into the labour market, in a general climate of shortage, in which the legal population, both foreign and indigenous, is cruelly aware of the problem of unemployment. Consequently, despite its general approach, which cannot but be endorsed, I am unable to support a report which contains in it the seed of a new attack on the concepts of citizenship and republican legitimacy which I hold so dear. Lieneman report (A5-0027/2000) Mr President, some of us in Parliament will remember the successful film, ""Cocoon"", in which some elderly people drank a special kind of water that made them young again. In my view, it is, therefore, immensely important to exercise extreme vigilance over the water we all drink and, consequently, to study and approve the provisions referred to here. For that reason, I approved these measures, but I should also like to express the hope that there will be particularly rigorous monitoring of water purity at the point where it enters our houses, to ensure that it is of the highest level. In the measures that have been adopted, I note that support for people who purify their water in their own homes has been omitted. I trust that this will be remedied in the future. Apart from Amendment No 76, which was an error, since I intended to vote in favour, the rest of my votes can be explained by means of the following fictional situation: Supposed draft environmental directive: ""European Parliament and Council Directive establishing the obligation to maintain, during winter, a temperature of no less than eighteen degrees centigrade in the streets, squares and parks of the cities of Europe "". Guidelines of the Directive: a) each city shall provide the means, in terms of energy and technology, sufficient for this objective to be achieved by 2012; b) the full costs shall be passed on to the inhabitants of each city by means of electricity prices. Opinion of an MEP from the north of Europe: ""This Directive would be unfair since, for example, the cost for an inhabitant of Stockholm would be two hundred times greater than the cost for an inhabitant of Naples "". Opinion of an MEP from the south of Europe: ""Nevertheless, this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions"". (End of fiction). In explaining my vote, I must say that it is positive that there is a Community directive on water, but I believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of Europe, but will lead to legislative caricature. We cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts, such as the Mediterranean countries, and countries with northern levels of rainfall."	fi
The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling. The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road. This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses. Like my group, I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel, offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection. Mr President, the European Parliament is today facing an important decision. Will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or, as the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others cause me to fear, will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry? The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake. It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection! The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious: to sabotage the directive! The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation. In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more. This is totally unacceptable. I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today! The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive. Do not continue in this vein! The whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the German car industry. Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers! Vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry! Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997. It is high time that we reached an agreement. Since I more or less share the views of my colleague, Mr Sj√∂stedt and the representative of the Greens, Mr de Roo, I am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me, and I will highlight just two issues. Firstly, and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal, the idea, which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste, that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution. Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed, not only in the case of lead, cadmium and mercury, but also in the case of waste which contains PVC. Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context. The other question is who should bear the cost. I agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay, and this proposal expresses that idea very well. Producers must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006, as some of the amendments propose. We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading. It is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials. I believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines. Lastly, Mr President, I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which, if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised, can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area, preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies. Mr President, most of the time, the European Parliament, spearheaded by environment committees, does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the European Commission or the Council, so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view. Now, a sound common position submitted by the Council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in Parliament. Every year, we discard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances. This is why it is important to prevent waste materials. We should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals, as well as of other dangerous substances and materials.	fi
I am aware of the limitations of the exercise given that we have to work within the current Treaty and are therefore restricted by its operational rules. I am thinking in this respect of the important issue of taxation which I am not, however, going to talk about. Rather, I want to start by welcoming certain proposals which you have made in this programme for 2000. These include all the proposals on food safety which are ambitious and important and those on maritime safety which are particularly important given the two oil slicks which have affected the coast of Brittany and Turkey. The Commission should react quickly in this respect. However, on other issues the proposals could be more ambitious and faster acting. I have some positive suggestions to make, particularly on the social area, the environment and the follow-up to Seattle. Firstly, you have said that the citizens of Europe must be reconciled with the institutions. This is self-evident and it is therefore essential to find out their main concerns. For example, in the social area, it is not enough to announce a communication on a programme of social action. We must move faster. You must submit a new social action programme to us by the end of the year. The issue of company closures and mass redundancies is one which has been and still is very firmly in the news. We are working on the basis of a directive whose limitations have been clearly demonstrated. I therefore propose that this should be reviewed in order to produce a directive which is more effective in protecting employment and also in imposing penalties on those who do not comply. On the environment, you have announced a proposal for a decision on a sixth action programme on the environment. This is all very well but it seems that the text to be proposed will not contain any specific objectives or a timetable for implementation. Perhaps you can correct me on this. I personally feel that it is essential to have precise objectives and a proper timetable for implementation. In terms of civil liability for the environment, it is right that we finally have a White Paper. However, Parliament did ask for a legislative initiative six years ago. The White Paper clearly foreshadows this legislation but for when? You must realise that this process needs to be accelerated. Finally, after Kyoto, we should be able to rapidly produce precise proposals. Finally, on the subject of the WTO, the idea of relaunching a new global round is not necessarily bad. However, in the first place, the Commission should make proposals on changing the operational rules of the WTO. The Commission has a role both within the EU and throughout the world. The European Union must therefore instigate a re-evaluation of the WTO' s operation which must lead to precise proposals being made on its rules. Madam President, you spoke about fundamental political values, and one of the fundamental political values, even more important than democracy, is respect for others.	el
(Applause from the right) It is via diplomacy, persuasion, knowledge, and solidarity, and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles. Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this. This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions. So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region. However, we already knew this. However, today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union' s democratic role. We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples, and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights. We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union. This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks. We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics. And these are the consequences! Therefore, we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people, thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples. Madam President, today we have an appointment with hypocrisy. Here we have a Council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach. In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria. There are risks, as we are all aware, but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach. If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union, then, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them. And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court. We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway. We could, if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter. We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years, 13 years of party politics which has made one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten, just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy, Belgium and other European Union Member States.	fr
The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions, such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected. Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy. This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used. Nowadays, taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming. The obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay, although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases. Fourthly, we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined. Fifthly, the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear. Against that background, our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by Mrs Lienemann, the rapporteur, as adopted in committee. We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended. We will therefore vote for the Greens' Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position. As regards pricing policy, there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report. My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43, tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens' Amendment No 105. I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned. However, some people in our political group think otherwise. Consequently, Amendment No 107, on the same question, has been tabled by one section of our group only. On the whole, I welcome the committee's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise. Mr President, every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet, yet the abundance of water is an illusion. The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders. Water is a renewable but limited natural resource. It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable. In the EU, this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas. The increase in vulnerable areas, both wet and dry, inequalities between countries, inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic, economic, geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need. However, these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community. We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land. Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive.	el
There are two reasons why we are saying no. Firstly, these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and, to my mind, the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty, which have not been fully realised. This is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support. The other main reason, however, is that, even though we are concerned here with a Convention (and therefore with international cooperation), there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal. And the trend is towards creating, in the longer term, a common European area of jurisdiction, common EU criminal law and common EU administration of justice. We would warn against that trend. We have this AFSJ mantra - Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - the full enormity of which lies in its establishment of EU systems which will play havoc with existing legal traditions relating to these sensitive and important questions which are overwhelmingly national in character. Mr President, I too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom, security and justice which Europe will hopefully one day become. It is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons, in which there are no frontiers to crime, but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime. A small step - I say - but nonetheless a welcome one, for which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has quite correctly wanted to prescribe further restrictions and guarantees in the name of the defence of the fundamental rights of the individual that are in force in the Member States and in the Union itself, even if these are not yet enshrined in a European Union charter of rights, which we hope will soon come into being: just restrictions and guarantees because, unfortunately, existing rights are, in practice, not always respected by every public authority in every Member State. Certain isolated passages in the Commission' s proposal perhaps err on the side of caution, as is the case when it is maintained that the detainee accused should be given the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of preliminary enquiries. I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation. Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link. These are nevertheless minor flaws, which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote. The rapporteur has made laudable efforts, which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him. The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account. There is, as has already been said, one point still to resolved, which is also the most delicate one: it concerns article 18 of the convention, which relates to the interception of communications originating in one Member State, but which are directly performed by another Member State, without the assistance being requested of the State in which the interception is being carried out, something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology.	fr
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States. It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform. We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union. Having said this, Mr President, this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference. In theory, we could have done so. We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th. However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement. Mr President, I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly. The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues. Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself. However, the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference. This is for one very simple reason: according to the agreements made in Helsinki, this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues, which are currently decided unanimously, being decided by a qualified majority. Therefore, the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase. It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament. Therefore, since the qualified majority will be extended, there will also be more codecision with Parliament. However, this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union. That it is what we are doing. We believe that, in the political design of the Union, other issues need to be dealt with. These include, amongst others, the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues, which have made much progress recently, but which must be incorporated into the Treaty. Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and work began on its wording yesterday, which I believe has started very positively. We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union' s institutions. Therefore, Mr President, our proposals, which we will specify in another report, together with the proposals of the Commission, which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents.	fr
Mind you, even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved. There are certain weaknesses, the greatest of which, in my opinion, is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses; after all, the car industry is more than just large companies. It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises. For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector. The plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs. The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint. It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position, I really must object, because quite simply, it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car, which contain a great deal of plastic, by means of rigid, high recycling quotas! Consequently, we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars. The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation. However, the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these. Mr President, we are indeed now in a very rare situation: those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position. In contrast to what the previous speaker said, I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values. If we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs, we will be creating a loophole: we will not have created a rational, clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order. That is why, in my opinion, the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility. Only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem, taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future. Mr President, there are two issues of principle in the Council' s draft directive. The first concerns the manufacturer' s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles. There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade. This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles. I believe that, quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned, the EU' s directives should not treat small companies within the Union unfairly. Unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears, for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts. Yet the trade in used car parts is important, especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles. The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy. It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up. They should be able to establish themselves in new markets, but also to leave old markets. To bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development.	de
There is a great deal of pain, a lot of suffering in Kosovo. The people are holding demonstrations, they are sending us e-mails. They ask us where their children are, their sons. We need to be able to go back with a proper answer. The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many. We are right to include this in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds, even thousands of Flora Brovinas out there. I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners. The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo. Mr President, in the present joint draft resolution, paragraph 10 urges the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the UN police units. This request is fully in line with the vision held by the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo, Mr Bernard Kouchner. In order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo, he needs, by his own reckoning, at least 6 000 foreign police officers. The UN, however, have pledged to dispatch a police force of 4 800. To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal. Moreover, half of this group is from the United States and Germany. It is logical that the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation, especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region. What is disconcerting, however, is Mr Kouchner' s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days. Paris is leaving its fellow-countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen, not more than 37, in the crisis region. For this hardly honourable position, Mr Kouchner blames none other than the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Chev√®nement. According to Mr Kouchner, the Minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the French police officials on ideological grounds. I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome. Press freedom in Angola Mr President, I do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity. On the question of Angola, I think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last. It would be the first in a long time. So I welcome it as such. I think that the European Union and the western world in general has had Mr Savimbi in their crossfire for some time now, with no discrimination whatsoever, but corruption is now so rife in Mr Dos Santos' s regime that even his long-standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything. So I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter, especially the worrying things which we are discussing, particularly logistics support for the information services by the United States and Great Britain, generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely 'spicy' matters which we need to go into. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the European Union. Clearly, governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial, geostrategic or economic interests. We have established requirements for the countries which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support, because we believe in democracy and its values. A free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy. There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion. Yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted, detained, threatened or put under pressure. We rightfully condemned the behaviour of UNITA which threatened the peace process in Angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace. Rightfully and with the full weight of our authority, we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the Government of Angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society.	fi
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. VOTE (Parliament approved the Commission proposal) Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE). Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4). These are both about voting. Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes, the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then, if there is some doubt, should we utilise the electronic voting system? That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call. You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it. In this particular case, I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on. Mr President, I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general. It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands, so to speak, but go straight to the electronic voting system. I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure. I know it takes longer, but should we not always have a show of hands first? Mr President, as far as the second reading is concerned, the Commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by Parliament. The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it. (The President declared the common position approved (as amended)) Report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (COM(1999)0158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) Report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 (COM(1999)0344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Sixth Periodic Report on the Social and Economic Situation and Development of the Regions of the European Union (SEC(1999)0066 - C5-0120/1999 - 1999/2123(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (A5-0069/1999) by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (COM(1999)0101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (A5-0078/1999) by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy (1998) (SEC(1999)0743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (A5-0087/1999) by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors (COM(1999)148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS))	fr
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here. For example, I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance, if applicable, and making this a final competence, in those spheres where benches of the Court, which resemble courts, pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law. I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level. It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions. We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind. Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance. In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance. On a final note, I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law. As things stand, OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases. It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court. The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance. That would be another way of spurring the reform process on. Mr President, I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work. The European Union is a system based on law. It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law. Furthermore, if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them, what happens, as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, is that justice delayed becomes, as we know, justice denied. The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem. However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC, In my own country, mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges. There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system. The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo/French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union' s disputes resolution procedures. This has been compounded, so some who advise me believe, by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government. Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible. This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable. What is happening in France, Mr President, appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties. I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings. I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this.	fi
And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged. The more remote the community, the greater the difference becomes. That is the measure of the problem. It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service. It is for all our remote and island communities, no matter where in the European Union they are situated, and not just for the people of Scotland, that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide. . Mr President, I consider it a privilege that I am replacing my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, on the occasion of such a high-quality debate on postal services. I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein. May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament. Some Members, like Mr Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal. Others believe that it is not so bad after all, if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation. This is, for example, the position expressed by Mr Berthu. The Commission' s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the Commission, of which I am sure Parliament is not totally unaware. But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made. It is Commissioner Bolkestein' s intention to present such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year. The scheduled date of 1 January 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible. The proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service, to which I will come back in a second. As regards the existing directive and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive. A number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence. The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003. Further liberalisation will occur afterwards. In some areas competition is already taking place, as in the parcels sector and in the express services. The quality of services has, generally speaking, improved, in particular in regard to cross-border activity. The quality of services, which is so relevant to consumers, was a main concern of all speakers, some of whom, like Mr R√ºbig, were very explicit on this point. The experiences in countries where liberalisation is more advanced such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, prove that when liberalisation takes place in an orderly way, the quality of service may be raised as a result of higher-quality service requirements imposed by the national regulations and their follow-up. So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality. Frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on-going standardisation of the measurement of the quality of service also contributes, as these standards will better reflect actual performance. This will allow for meaningful bench-marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent operator as a result of the combined pressure by regulators, competitors and customers.	de
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms. However, in order to compensate for this, all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued, and as the Commission' s proposal would have it, more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued. An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection, not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter. This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident. Likewise, the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued, namely under the terms of an opposition procedure. What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States, rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States. I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs. I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months, and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting. However, we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months. When it comes to self-employed persons, in addition to the amendments already described, we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent, and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment. I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee' s amendments, which they adopted unanimously. I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions. I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament' s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted; whether or not one should use the number or date alone, or both, and how extensively to quote from them. Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report. I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons. I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology, i.e. the correct way to quote. This would make our rapporteur' s life considerably easier in the future. There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio' s reports. Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously, and I would like to stand by this outcome, which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions. On a final note, I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in compiling these reports, which were far from easy to produce.	de
On the other hand, however, we must take care not to classify certain peoples in a particular manner. We are therefore against point 4 of the joint resolution which names Montenegro. Of course, Montenegro also has internal security problems, as we do in the EU for that matter. But Montenegro presently faces a huge threat; as you will have heard, and as officially confirmed by NATO yesterday, Milosevic has again started military operations against Montenegro. We must be careful not to give him an excuse. Therefore, solidarity in the fight against organised crime, yes, but please, no specific passage on Montenegro; just support for Montenegro in its struggle for greater freedom. Mr President, I consider the consensus reached in this Chamber on the need for a new initiative to fight organised crime very important, in particular because of the realisation which spread from the Group on behalf of which I am speaking, that the dramatic events in Brindisi are not just an issue which is confined to the Region of Puglia, but that they draw on values, principles and objectives which are an integral part of the new European policy and on the question of justice and security for the citizens of the Union. Parliament and the institutions of the Union must take due account of this perspective and provide a rational response to the fear and insecurity experienced by the citizens in the face of crime, and it must fight all aspects of crime, including those who resort to brutal violence with no qualms about killing the forces of law and order and defenceless citizens, and the supranational financial and economic criminal organisations. The links between criminal groups in different countries and the increasingly wide geographical spread of crime call for a supranational response. After all, security is one of Europe' s objectives in the Treaty of Amsterdam and was on the agenda of the European Council held in Tampere in the autumn of 1999. We hope that substantial decisions similar to those proposed in Tampere will be taken regarding the creation of common investigation groups, a European police academy and a genuine European judiciary such as EUROJUS. This is the path we must take, taking due account of the fight against crime taking place in the Balkan States in our relations with these countries. Finally, may I also express my sympathy for the families of the victims and recognise before this Chamber the extreme sense of duty shown by those two officers in that tragic event which took place on 24 February. The Commission has examined with great interest the resolution concerning the threat posed by the development of illicit activities of criminal groups operating in several countries of south-eastern Europe. We share the preoccupation expressed in the resolution as to the risk of seeing the reconstruction and development efforts in the context of the Stability Pact being jeopardised by international criminal networks that engage mainly in trafficking in human beings, trafficking in drugs and arms as well as in smuggling of goods. Clearly a lot of these criminal activities have serious negative consequences for the Community and its Member States.	el
"The agreement with Macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the European Union, allowing this country to join, even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future. In the meantime, we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for Macedonian legislation to resemble that of the Member States, and our policy should reflect this, even in the naming of aid programmes for Macedonia. I would quote the PHARE programme as an example. Mr President, the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivities surrounding it. I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic. If certain countries wish to use the words ""former Yugoslavia"" , then that is their business; others need not feel obliged to copy them. It will not do to keep us under constant pressure. Hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda; we have come to expect nothing less of him, and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia. Mr President, let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda' s work as rapporteur. Today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia. We do so in the awareness that this decision, the very first relating to that area, is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the Balkans. This new phase, or rather policy, identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully. Our agreement to the negotiations, as set out in the rapporteur' s explanatory statement, is born of the conviction that it is right for Union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the acquis communautaire. This is the dual objective which I believe should be pursued. On the one hand, we must maintain programmes on, for example, infrastructure, preparations - still premature - for free trade, and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area, and on the other, it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an example of the policy. And there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive. As we were able to ascertain during our missions to Skopje, there has been considerable progress in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as regards the economy, movement towards democracy and - an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the Balkans - multi-ethnic coexistence. On the other hand, the price Macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring Kosovo is very high, both in terms of logistic availability of NATO forces and in terms of reduced exports to Northern Europe."	fr
In this context, the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated. The essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the European institutions, as contained in the European project enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union. I understand your concern about the rights of children. Many elements of our work, and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, involve protecting the rights of children. This is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully. Each Member State is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children. As for the EU' s responsibility, the rights of children must be recognised in the Charter according to the areas in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship, in its broadest sense, of children. I hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable Member has posed for the Commission and the whole Convention. Mr President, I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach. However, I should like to ask a slightly different question. We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issues that the Community is dealing with this year. Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter? It is very important that the people feel engaged in this process. I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has. Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate? It is the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far-reaching as the Charter is. I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights. We can achieve the best of both worlds by having a clear text, a text that can be easily read by the citizens, and at the same time a text that can be used as a legal instrument. There is no contradiction between the two. The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter. I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here. Question No 40 by (H-0095/00): Subject: Articles 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is clear from statements over the past years that J√∂rg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria.	de
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union' s institutional bodies. I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows. My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement. Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union' s institutions. Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public. In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference. At the same time, however, I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform, I repeat, of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health, energy, culture, transport and even tourism. Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end. All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference. This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union' s Member States. In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament' s backing. The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us. Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki. It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union' s institutions. In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary. The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States. It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform. We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union.	de
The presumed killer, Sid Ahmed Rezala, is also strongly suspected of having murdered the British student Isabel Peake, who was raped and thrown out of the train taking her to see her parents, and another young woman, √âmilie Bazin, who was found dead in Amiens under a pile of coal in the building where he lived. Rezala should never have been in France. He arrived from Algeria at a time when, according to the authorities, immigration had been stopped and there was no reason for him to come. He should never have stayed in France, having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences, which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country. He should never have been free because 14 charges of theft, violence and rape had been brought against him, one of which was for the rape of a minor. He should never have been able to escape from France, but the officers pursuing him had no jurisdiction and European frontiers have more holes than a sieve. He should never have arrived in Spain, where he mugged a woman at knifepoint and yet was immediately released by the Spanish authorities. Today, thanks to the complex networks of sexual deviants, he is in Portugal. Portugal refuses to extradite him on the grounds that he would face a longer prison sentence in France than that provided for in the Portuguese penal code. I should like to ask the Portuguese minister, the President-in-Office of the Council, to put a stop to this scandal at once. I should like to ask the House to wake up, at long last, to the appalling situation of the victims of policies for which the establishment, not the yobs, bears full responsibility. Mr President, this agreement deals with a sensitive issue: cooperation in the field of criminal law. It is therefore understandable that the Council finds it difficult to agree. Successful application of this agreement by the Member States requires unanimity within the Council. Only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice. This, however, does not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously. Quite the reverse, in fact. The Council' s proposal must comply with legislation of the national Member States in the field of criminal law. The wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test. Careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but, above all, by the national parliaments, is therefore of key importance. Mr Di Pietro' s proposal to omit the current Article 18 regarding intercepting telecommunications, amongst other things, is understandable, although very strict. The text of Article 18 is ambiguous: he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a Member State in another Member State without the latter' s prior authorisation. In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State. Proposed additions, such as repeated references to the ECHR, the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of Member States to implement the ECHR, add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement. I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text. The Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will, however, despite hesitation, not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation. This clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much-discussed European citizenship. On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting. Pursuant to Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union' s objective is 'to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia' .	fi
It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased. The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union' s relations with Cambodia. Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected. Living examples of this have been the Pinochet-Ugarten case, Kosovo and, in milder form in our own Union, the debate surrounding the government decision in Austria. This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice. At the same time, the struggle against impunity is under threat. The situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow. . Mr President, we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday. I am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge. First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails. Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation. In particular we support the development of a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society. Our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and, in particular, to try to build confidence between the various communities. We have always condemned ethnic violence, no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim. We consider it is unacceptable against Serb and Roma minorities as it was against the Kosovar Albanians in the past. We support the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR and the OSCE to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order. In this regard we strongly support the High Representative' s recent appeal to Member States to provide more police officers for the UN civil police mission in Kosovo. It was a point raised by several speakers in the debate. I hope it will underline the importance, when we address the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy, of looking at the non-military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects. It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity. We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons.	de
This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region. The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet. 85% of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is. Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing. Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million. We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there. Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift. As you say tons of food, water purification equipment, tents, blankets. Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources. Are we ready to pay for those resources? Mozambique is, of course, one of the poorest countries in the world, but one of Africa' s great success stories with its work on economic growth, on poverty reduction, on democracy in spite, of course, of massive debt pressures. Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured. How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country. Thank you, Mrs Kinnock. Mr Nogueira, we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure. The debate is closed. Union Economy (1999) The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document 'The EU Economy 1999 Review' [C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)]. The report of the Commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the European economy which it finds promising, especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8% by the year 2001. This picture in the opinion of your rapporteur has to be set against a background of sluggishness, of growth of only 1.9% per year throughout the 1990s, despite instances of higher growth rates during that decade which we were, however, unable to consolidate. It would follow that if we do not wish the same old failures of the past to reassert themselves, we must use the current window of opportunity of improved economic performance in order to launch a new policy of transition into self-sustained higher growth levels in our economy. This is the challenge. Faced with this challenge the Commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal fundamentals of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents.	el
"As we sit here, hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in Mozambique. This has not just happened. The flooding has been going for weeks, and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need. The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic. For a long time, many of us have sounded a warning that the European Union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision-making structures, when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments, particularly for humanitarian intervention. I acknowledge Mr Patten' s efforts in this direction, but what a pity that the governments of the Member States had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of NATO. Of course, there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries. These are of long standing, but are being addressed already within NATO. I have not yet heard a convincing security-policy explanation of why the European Union needs to establish autonomous, decision-making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the NATO structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival NATO. After all, the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table. NATO is largely European. Finally, Mr Solana, I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe. Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, with regard to the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the European Union in particular. Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide. How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters? How should we describe the sinister filtration camps, which are comparable to concentration camps, in which the population is suffering the most dreadful humiliation and from which able-bodied men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive? How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called ""cleansing"" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe? And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres? If that is realpolitik, if we really do not have any means, Mr Solana, as High Representative of the CFSP, and Commissioner, I put this question to you both, let us at least use the means that we do have, namely, the aid programmes to Russia."	el
What we have to recognise is that when we are considering a broader Community, no situation affecting democratic rights in one country can be a matter of indifference to the other countries and their citizens. We are all European citizens and we are all citizens of a European Union which is underpinned, politically speaking, by a basic set of principles. If these principles are at risk, we have the right - and the duty - to sound the alarm. But whether lists of parties are desirable or otherwise, I hope that this never becomes a matter for the European Union. Yes, but the problem, of course, is that this is what we are concerned with here. Because Austria has a county mayor in Klagenfurt who has expressed himself in a way for which you and I feel equal revulsion, you have punished a country with sanctions and you are punishing a people with sanctions, including those individuals who may have voted against the party in question, and this without specifying what their crime entails. Up until now, it is only opinions you are punishing and not actions. If it were a question of actions, it would perhaps be Denmark which should be punished for a ban on immigrants of a kind which the FP√ñ has not been able to put into practice. It is therefore opinions which you have punished and not actions. I should therefore like to know, when I next vote, if Portugal and other countries - outside the Council - will wish to propose sanctions against my country in the event, for example, of the present Danish government' s incorporating ministers from the Socialist People' s Party or Unity List, which are both opposed to Economic and Monetary Union, or if they will wish to prevent the appointment of a government including Fogh Rasmussen from the Left party if he relies upon support from the Danish People' s Party which, in many newspapers, is described as a party equivalent to the FP√ñ in Austria. Knowing the answer to these questions would be useful as a guide to the consumer, but it may well be that the action taken by the 14 Prime Ministers is a source of regret. Mr Bonde knows what I have said in previous answers: in the specific case of Austria, and I know that that is what is behind his question, we are not working at Community level, but through bilateral relations. The attitude adopted by some Member States towards the Austrian Government related to their negative perception of the new Austrian Government, which does not affect the Community framework. We are not working at Council level here. The European Union has not taken a single discriminatory measure against Austria. These 14 Member States decided of their own free will to make plain to the Austrian authorities their displeasure at the kind of government they had established, and above all at the fact that they had included in the government a party which advocates, or has advocated in the past - it is difficult to distinguish between the past and the present in the Freedom Party' s statements - a certain ideology and a certain way of interpreting European values.	el
This is why the UEN Group has not supported the amendments which are inapplicable in our Member States and whose anticipated economic consequences could prove to be very harmful. Otherwise, as a local elected representative, I hope that the merger and simplification of the Community directives will clarify and streamline the regulatory framework in which the departmental waste management plans must be established. The adoption of this directive on waste incineration, which will come into force with effect from 2005, will considerably improve the current waste management framework in Europe, by giving higher priority to important criteria such as public health and the protection of citizens' rights. Furthermore, if this directive were to come into force immediately, rather than in 2005 as is unfortunately the case, it would be virtually impossible for the Portuguese Government to continue with its co-incineration strategy. As it is, given that this directive imposes strict technical, legal and operational restrictions on all incineration and co-incineration processes across Europe, it will become more obvious that the strategy being pursued in Portugal is deeply flawed. Accordingly, although I would have liked to go further with restrictions on incineration and co-incineration processes, I am nevertheless delighted with what has been achieved, given that this directive: 1. Establishes stricter limit values for emissions, in particular those of carbon oxides and particulates. 2. Will put incineration and co-incineration plants on the same footing in terms of limit values, removing the special status granted to co-incineration plants. 3. States without any doubt whatsoever that incineration and co-incineration may only be used as a last resort, once all other technical avenues have been explored. 4. Sets extremely rigid conditions for overall waste management and for the siting and size of incineration and co-incineration plants, which must be complied with before permission can be granted to any authority. 5. Increases the relevant authorities' powers of intervention in case of non-compliance with limit values at installations. 6. Drastically reduces the scope for using the end waste from incineration and co-incineration, particularly in civil engineering projects. 7. Makes continuous sampling of dioxins a compulsory requirement in incineration and co-incineration processes. 8. Increases the role of the public in decision making on the siting of installations. 9. Makes it compulsory to publish an annual environmental report on compliance with limit values. 10. Considerably limits the present derogations for cement kilns. 11. For the first time sets a limit value for emissions of ammonia, NH3, in view of the atmospheric acidification caused by this chemical product. The proposed directive on waste incineration is a complex and technical document whose environmental and economic implications must be carefully considered. At first reading the European Parliament really made its mark on the issue by proposing the merger of two directives on the incineration of domestic waste and the incineration of hazardous waste. I now believe that the common position submitted by the Council is a very good compromise which I can support. However, I must make one specific point about co-incineration in cement works and justify my vote against two amendments.	el
In my opinion, the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then. It is a question of doing what is technically possible; obviously it is not possible to do anymore, but we must be sufficiently ambitious. I would like to comment on one issue, which was spoken about earlier. I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water. This is not merely a problem for Spain; it is one for the Nordic countries, and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters, when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive. Mr President, Madam Commissioner, congratulations, Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work. Water and air surround us everywhere. We share them with everyone on this earth. Water is a prerequisite for human life. And there are more and more of us in the world. Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal. Nothing could be further from the truth! It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so, too, the conditions for life. It is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources. I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order. Mr President, we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann, the targets it sets and the directive under discussion. However, we should look a little more closely at some points. For example, a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes, which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments, and which, of course, are a great risk to ground waters, water tables and surface waters. I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place, the specifications common to us all must be very stringent. But the key issue is, in my opinion, planning how to restore water tables, the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes, which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind. I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding, because, at the end of the day, that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy. Mr President, here we have what is basically a good measure. It sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management. Its aim of good-quality water for drinking, for wildlife, the environment and economic purposes is right. The prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood.	el
We must take action and the example should come from above. The reform of the Commission, Mr Prodi, should not only protect the financial interests of the Community. Far more resources are lost through an ineffective and unmotivated administration. Furthermore, we also have to accept that officials who take responsibility and risks may make mistakes. You said in your speech that you prefer to make mistakes rather than fail to act. Go for it, Mr Prodi. Your task must be an historic task. You are not the first to try it. We hope that you succeed. Mr President, it is interesting that Mr Prodi has presented today a work programme; however, our agenda says that we are having a debate on a legislative programme. Looking at it from the point of view of social and employment policy we certainly do not have a legislative programme before us. In fact we have not had a legislative programme for several years now. What we have had instead is a process of consolidation and the development of certain convergence processes such as that developed and launched at Luxembourg. We welcome the Luxembourg procedure. We hope it will be deepened, strengthened and extended to other areas such as convergence in social protection. But does that mean that we have done the job in terms of legislation in the social area? I think not. There are a number of areas where we need to update and modernise the social legislation we have adopted in the past. With the deepening and strengthening of the internal market and globalisation we are seeing an increasing number of mergers, take-overs and transfers within the European Union. That, to me, says that we need to look back at the whole framework of legislation we developed largely in the 1970s in this area - on transfers, collective redundancies, insolvency, and latterly on works councils. We need to modernise and strengthen that legislation, not in order to stop globalisation or the deepening of the internal market - of course not - but in order to make sure that we manage the changes these things bring, through a spirit of partnership in all of our workplaces, large and small, within the European Union. That means that we need to pursue with vigour the general framework on information and consultation at work. In the health and safety field as well, there is a need to update and modernise the legislation we adopted in the past: the pregnant women at work directive, five years overdue for review; the noise directive of 1986, ten years overdue for review; a number of directives that need to be radically updated and modernised. But is it just about updating? No. We do not need any new great raft of social legislation, but there are areas that have not been addressed. We have outstanding promises for legislation on homeworking, on teleworking; we have the yawning gap of social security in atypical work that has been outstanding for almost a decade now; we have the promise of a specific directive on muscular-skeletal injuries outstanding from the last medium-term Social Action Programme. There are other areas. I had a woman come to see me recently, called Mrs Angela Elliot Mathis, working for Lucent Technologies. She was head-hunted into the company at a very high level to work as a senior manager and a board member. She had worked in a range of European countries for high technology companies. Thirteen months into the job she was dismissed without notice and without reason. She still has no reason for the dismissal. The remarkable thing is that she has no protection in either Belgian law - she was working in Belgium - or European law. Without that sort of protection people will not take the opportunity to live, move and work wherever they can within the European Union. These are the gaps we need to plug. Let us do it in the new medium-term Social Action Programme. Mr President, I want to highlight the areas of the work programme which affect directly the work of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	fi
That concludes Questions to the Commission. (The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.) Community policy in the field of water (continuation) The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy. Mr President, the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease. To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East. In fact, a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania, threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia. I understand that Mrs Wallstr√∂m, whose presence here tonight I appreciate, is going to visit the area. I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin. The development of this directive has been difficult and complex, involving diverse interests and divided opinions. I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature, Mrs Lienemann, has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions, and has succeeded to a large extent. However, it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations. I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain. The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity, century after century, year after year, day after day, and is still doing so today. Therefore, it seems essential to us that the directive complies, in practice, with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions. In accordance with this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 (Recital 21), 13 and 49 (Article 11(d)), since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States, that is, the regulation of water resources. It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions, given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests. We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010. We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which, at the same time, safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development.	fr
The report does not contain what the title promises. Madam President, thanks are due to Mr Haarder for a basically splendid piece of work. There is, nonetheless, one point on which I have to say that I disagree with the rapporteur. When I read the Danish version of Mr Haarder' s report, I thought for one brief moment that Mr Haarder had grown wiser with the years, and I had taken note of the fact that there is now a judgement from the Danish Supreme Court stating that so-called 'exclusive agreements' do not contravene human rights. I believed and hoped that I could declare myself in agreement with Mr Haarder in emphasising the individual' s right to membership of trade unions. When, however, the report is read in other languages, it can be seen that Mr Haarder has not grown wiser. Either that, or he is hiding it very well. From a number of unclear wordings, it looks as if the rapporteur is continuing his crusade against the Danish model, in which employees and employers are able to agree that only members of a specific trade union can be employed in a specific area of work. No one is being deprived of the right to work and no one is being deprived of the right to belong to a trade union, but individuals cannot benefit from extensive social agreements without also being themselves members of precisely that union which has produced the agreements. Mr Haarder goes much further in his assault, for he tries indirectly to strengthen those unions which do not recognise precisely those collective victories which have helped create the welfare and the human rights which we have spent all day debating. Madam President, I notice that you have not called Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar, who had asked me to speak on his behalf. I would therefore ask you to allow me the two minutes allotted to Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar, so that I can present his intervention, and then the four minutes allotted to me, if this is acceptable to you. I will therefore present Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar' s intervention. Madam President, the debate on xenophobia and racism is always of great importance, politically and socially. The Ludford report contains points which are highly acceptable and which any democrat can and must ratify, but also contains other points which are less than rigorous from a political and even from a legal point of view. European citizenship is an abstract concept which lacks any legal form. The Member States regulate the political rights of their citizens in accordance with their own democratic laws, as also happens in many of the countries of origin of the citizens who emigrate to the European Union. To ask for political participation in local, national or European elections, or even access to the civil service for people who are not nationals of the Member States, without even coming to a reciprocal arrangement, is politically unrealistic and displays a lack of legal rigour. It would be impossible to comply with a proposal of this type and I therefore ask Mrs Ludford to withdraw it so that we can vote in favour of her report.	el
Although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares, this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of financiers, often shareholders, with the sole unavowed aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company. The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers, be they by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this respect. Rationalised management and improved profits should, in my view, serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost, and any financial benefits should follow. However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit. There is a very real risk of seeing a two-headed monster emerge on this planet, with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital. Surely Europe should act as a safeguard, maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare? We must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results. Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for 'difference' . Europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs. Without doubt, the voice of difference in this monotonous flood of restructuring. Mr President, last month in the UK, in a region that neighbours mine, the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres. I, like all Members present, am saddened by this loss of jobs. Equally, I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution. But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company' s decision. This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes, in this institution, forget that Europe cannot survive alone. We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent. In my few months here, I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU, nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave. In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted. Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant. In a world where surely less regulation is the key, we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union, untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens.	de
We need to make our citizens feel at home, according to Mr Swoboda, and I agree. This is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility. This is probably linked to the standards mentioned by Mr Van Dam, namely subsidiarity. It is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners, rather than competitors when it comes to policy. It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens, where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves. That will require a new political culture, not only in words, but also in practice, which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions. Regions which, culturally and economically, sometimes match the interest of some Member States. The new Europe should not only expand horizontally, but also vertically, by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community. This is what the Commission will be judged on. Madam President, the Commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000-2005. These are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been glossed over to prevent any conflict. So, in the first part on the new forms of European governance, the words 'federalism' and 'superstate' are not mentioned at all. Yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong European institutions in which only day-to-day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an indistinct whole. In this scenario the governments and national parliaments are merged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society, all of which are described, with no form of hierarchy, as 'integral elements of European governance' . These ambiguities mask many misunderstandings, primarily about our values. It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat. It must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate, fair and transparent democratic debate, namely at national level in the main. Yet the whole of the Commission communication is based on the opposite theory. In this theory, on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples, their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations, new policies or new, restrictive legal structures such as the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights. This Charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights. In the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principles are rather different. Clearly we want to defend the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations. This is not impossible. We must move away from the outmoded federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on European matters comes from the Memoires of Jean Monnet. Instead, we must open the European institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations. This is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication, Mr Prodi, but which is unfortunately not there. Madam President, Mr Prodi, you claim to be shaping a new Europe yet you are lacking one basic element: confidence. The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this. And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption? You are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty, insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency. You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders. Consequently, you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration. You are now proposing to give all decision-making power to a handful of officials. The Member States, local authorities and NGOs will simply become enforcers of decisions handed down from above, all on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels.	fi
In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established. But creating parks with very limited financial resources, without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual. I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the beginning of 1999, discussions have taken place between the institutions on the subject of the proposed regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment known as LIFE. I would again thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have had on this matter. As a result of this, I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. The Commission welcomes, above all, Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, which apply to the Committee procedures. In these cases, Parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the Commission had to the common position. The Commission can, in principle, also approve Amendment No 4 which ought, however, to be introduced into another place in the text. With regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6, I want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water, together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect, are to a large degree covered by LIFE. The Commission nonetheless considers that, if this is stated separately, then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas. There is also a risk of overlap with other Community programmes such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technical Development and Demonstration. The present programme' s key measures - water quality, tomorrow' s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions. Where the question of the budget is concerned, I am pleased about the confidence shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Amendment No 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position. I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential. This instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget. The amount quoted in Amendment No 12 does not, however, tally with the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000. Allow me also to add that, if the budget is increased, greater demands are obviously going to be made upon the Directorate-General for the Environment if an increased number of projects are going to be dealt with. Account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decision-making procedure. At this stage, the Commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position. With regard to Amendment No 3, which we did not approve at first reading, I want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives, conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid.	fr
It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation. So coordination and cooperation are facts of life. But convergence should be about goals, not means. I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report. I can support the report, but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste. I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems, if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient, or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries. I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly, and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold. Dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended, but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same. There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions. Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security, I would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me. I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier. This seems to be a good thing and useful. I also feel positive about the essence of the communication, namely the strategic approach. We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved. We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled. On the one hand, it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg, but we also think it is important, as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker, that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios, such as sole traders, etc. We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found. The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security, which, we hope, will be replaced by high-level convergence. I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union. It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments, in fact, the majority of them, appear to be downward adjustments, the remainder being improvements. The lion' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans: eleven restrictions and two improvements. In the case of unemployment benefits, we came across six restrictions and five improvements. The reasons for adjustments are, for example, to improve employment, reduce social security expenditure, but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria. Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries. The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries. All in all, both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole. This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches. To use a figure of speech, cappuccino is not always good for us.  Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled.	de
The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities. We are all immigrants. For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated. Geographical mobility is not an invention of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work-related causes. We are all immigrants, if not ourselves personally, then through one of our relations or ancestors. However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment. What happened in El Ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the European Union. We must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area. A whole community should not have been held responsible, criminalised and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident. Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately. Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism. In particular, local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia, especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property. These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these, as has happened with the mayor in question. Thirdly, the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials. They must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union. Finally, the European Union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles. It must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstrations in its territory and support and collaborate with national, regional and local authorities and non-governmental organisations and associations in the application of these principles. This must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrants resident in the EU. Mr President, initially our Group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon. However, the incidents in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout Europe and which deserves our full attention. We thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in Europe. Yet, over the years, social disintegration in Europe has been combining with an increase in migration from surrounding countries and increased awareness of human rights to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance. This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider' s. This House therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures encompassing all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately. We must ensure respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues.	fr
If, among other things, as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well, the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue, focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge, in other words, a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules, this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes. Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, you have come here today, Mr Prodi, in a very reformist and ambitious mood. I welcome you and your ambition. Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us. In order to make these reforms, however, and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme, we must be very sure, not only of the strengths of the reformer himself, but also of the opinions of others. You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice. We have 1.27% of the Community' s GDP. Not a euro more or a euro less. It will not be us who refuse these new resources. You should ask the Council. These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre. In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans, we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4, and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget. I would remind you that this Group, the PPE-DE, does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones. The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs. Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system. It is all very well for us, by mutual consensus, to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation, but you must be very aware that the lack of resources, the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget, continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved. We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, in my view, this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses. There is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one.	el
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy. Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme. Firstly, however, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the truly excellent work he has done on this report. I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan. For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee. However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout. Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point, that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community. This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear. However, we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed. For in the course of the next few years, the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double, accounting for at least 12% of energy consumption. This is the European Union' s declared aim. That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role. In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples. To my mind though, what is particularly important about the ALTENER II programme are the new actions for relieving market saturation by renewable energies and those for implementing, supporting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan. We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission' s services on a breakthrough campaign, which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy. It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors. It is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it. The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion. 75%-80% of this is to come from private sources, and this will be supplemented by public funds from the Member States and from the regions. In this respect, the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment, and help us to realise our ambition, in the interests of environmental protection, the economy and creating new jobs. Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mr Langen for his excellent work in this important matter. The conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the Altener programme as put forward by the Conciliation Committee is, after all the difficult phases it has been through, at least satisfactory. Most of Parliament' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive. The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy. There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets, however. The appropriations are needed for pilot projects, research, information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy. The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States. This programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy. However, in the future, the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market. Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment. The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up. Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness. Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy. We should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment.	fi
"You have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which I have had dealings recently. There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4. In the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations. In the French version that becomes 'entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques' . Could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises is not correct. It should not be in the amendment. And, again, I urge you, Madam President, to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently. Madame McNally, in general, I am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations. I shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution.

In that regard allow me to say, since I come from a country through which the Danube flows, that I am grateful that the Commission, i.e. Commissioner Patten and also Vice-President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, is considering opening the Danube to shipping again. That would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too, which, of course, would be of particular importance to Romania. In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt. As I said, it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition. Secondly, let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union. In our view, it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now, but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date. FYROM wants to be told here and now that, in principle, accession will be possible when the time is right. This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined. It sees, in the whole readjustment of aid instruments, a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards Europe but that this train will continue through Europe while leaving FYROM on a siding. I think Commissioner Patten understands that too. So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks. Thirdly, I believe that, so far at least, FYROM has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly. Even though there will of course be readjustments here, FYROM will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being dealt with in Brussels today can in future be handled in Skopje, in the country itself. I hope that the honourable Members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM. Mr President, since the start of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this abbreviation - has behaved as a constructive peace-keeper. We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view. As you can see, our Macedonian friends have always played a very positive role and it is for this reason that it should be pointed out at this stage that Macedonia is not just a pawn in our so-called strive towards stability, but actually took the initiative. The former President, Mr Gligorov, can take special credit for this, and the current President too has already adopted the profile of President of all Macedonian citizens, so much so that the European Union should only be grateful to have him as interlocutor in the Balkans. Despite the obvious reasons for any internal tension, both population groups have struck a reasonable modus vivendi and the outlook for reaching a sound solution to the remaining problems is good.	el
What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie. What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis. I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs. These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie. A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic. Even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective, especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie, it is still a notable improvement. It is a pledge to European citizens, who have voiced their concern, as regards European food policy, on many occasions. The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard. As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution, traceability, responsibility and transparency, the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety. This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence. It is up to us, as responsible Europeans, to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive. Cederschi√∂ld report (A5-0008/2000) Mr President, I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament. In my view, products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products, namely, those that can be seen and touched. The fruits of the intellect and science, which are intangible, are of inestimable importance. Therefore, the European Community should be more energetic in providing practical encouragement, not just through upholding patents but through concessions and other forms of support for scientists who are striving, through the knowledge and experience they have acquired, to give future generations something better than that which they have today. . (DA) We oppose, on principle, the European Community' s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the Member States. We are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the Member States and the Community. At the same time, we appreciate the fact that the WIPO treaties are a significant step forward in the direction of guaranteeing the rights of distributors and practising artists. We are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation. - (DE) The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because, in the plenary debate of the previous day, Commissioner Bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding EU accession to the WIPO Treaties. In institutional terms, there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties. In addition, there is a clear tendency, in matters of international jurisdiction, more and more often to obtain a pure EU jurisdiction. When it is, then, still not clear to what extent the EP can participate in the decision-making processes, the question of legitimacy arises. Moreover, the concept of 'author' is not defined in the Treaties. In this regard, too, the Commission has not answered the question as to what definition it wishes to base its discussions on, and whether it wishes to settle foreseeable conflicts by imposing its own definition of the law on others. One of the trickiest aspects is the public interest: will ratifying and applying WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture? And, finally, the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarified. Regarding this, too, there has been only silence by way of a response from the Commission. If nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation, then we must at least abstain from voting.	fi
The report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed. The involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the EQUAL initiative and the projects. The development partnerships within the thematic fields, which are referred to in Amendment No. 22, would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the EQUAL initiative. My group will be supporting Amendment No. 22. Mr President, the report under discussion in the House today is doubtless of great importance. In addition to the objectives it is working towards, the strong point of the Community initiative INTERREG for the 2000-2006 programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include new Eastern European and Mediterranean countries. In my opinion, it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas. Indeed, these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the Union. It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the utmost importance, and that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has subsequently taken up. They call for the areas eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the Adriatic, as well as to the Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta - an applicant country - which, inexplicably, are not currently included in strand A, Annex 1. I am confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament' s position on the matter, in accordance with the Code of Conduct. There are fundamental advantages for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions. Finally, it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the INTERREG initiative and the existing Community programmes, which are significant for external policy, as a vector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes. Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, LEADER I was an outright success due, in particular, to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators. It is, I think, regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II, regarding the quality of the projects, the quantity of appropriations spent and, most especially, the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered. I am pleased to see, however, that under LEADER+, new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development.	el
What sort of logic is it which, in order to punish the supposed suppressor of a people, punishes his supposed victims? Mr President, that is what is being done with the barbaric bombing, that is what is being done with the fuel embargo on Yugoslavia. We are supporting a policy of genocide against a people which does not accept the choices foisted on it by the USA, NATO and the European Union. My question is this: because there have already been a great many deaths due to the cold, will the fuel embargo be lifted and will the Yugoslav people be left to decide its own fate? Mr President, I confess that I find it strange to hear the word genocide used about action against the Yugoslavian Government, the same Yugoslavian Government that carried out various actions in Kosovo involving exactly that type of behaviour. I also find it impossible to forget that this same government has, in the past, promoted a wide range of actions to destabilise Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, and has repeatedly played a destabilising role in the entire region. I totally accept the honourable Member' s premise that every people needs to be the master of its own destiny, that is exactly what we are seeking. But we want this to mean access to the media, total freedom of expression for the opposition, unrestricted individual rights, freedoms and guarantees, the rule of law and total transparency in the institutions. If that is what Mr Korakas thinks exists in Serbia, then we know where we stand. Question No 4 by (H-0155/00): Subject: Information on European Union citizens condemned to death In the absence of a reply from the Council to Question P-2697/99 within the deadlines laid down in the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure, can the Council say whether it is or is not in possession of information on the numbers, the identities, the legal situations, the conditions of detention and the personal and family situations of nationals of Member States of the European Union condemned to death in other countries? Has it attempted to obtain this information and, if so, will it forward it to the author of this question and to the European Parliament? If the Council is not in possession of such information, does it not agree that steps need to be taken to establish a system for keeping proper records of these cases? What action does it intend to take to remedy this lack of information? Mrs D√≠ez Gonz√°lez, you have asked an important question, but I have to confess that the Council does not have the information you have requested about the number of European Union citizens condemned to death in other countries. However, I would like to stress that work is currently being done through consular cooperation between Member States with a view to monitoring and safeguarding the interests and rights of the citizens of any Member State in third countries, particularly as regards the possibility of their being condemned to death. For this precise purpose, and in all cases where a citizen of a Member State is threatened with the death penalty in a third country, there is now a coordination mechanism allowing combined approaches to be made to the governments of third countries by the European Union missions in those countries. This cooperation between the missions of Member States will also cover information sharing on citizens who may be threatened with the death penalty. We will therefore, in due course, be able to give a concrete reply to this question, and to obtain specific and up-to-date information, but this will naturally depend on progress made with the consular cooperation that the European Union is trying to build up. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am grateful for your words but not for their content. In other words, I appreciate your concern but not the content of the information you have offered. This cannot be due to lack of time because I asked this question to the Council three months ago and it did not reply in writing. It did not reply within the time period laid down and is replying now, orally, two months late. Do you not think, Mr President-in-Office, that a census of European citizens sentenced to death throughout the world would be a very useful tool in the defence of the right to life, so that the political institutions of the European Union may be in a position to defend that right to life?	fi
Mr President, apparently, the Milosevic regime is not tired of fighting battles, not by a long shot. Recently, it has taken systematic action against local stations, in particular. It does not flinch from using violence in these activities. Neither do the government-run media shrink from launching a full-blown witch hunt against the country' s independent media. They are then termed rather scornfully 'NATO agents' and 'traitors of the mother country' . It is not by chance that the powerful Serbian police apparatus operates mainly at local level, especially in those towns and cities where the opposition emerged victorious in the 1996 local elections. With the same elections round the corner and parliamentary elections not too far off either, many in Serbia suspect that the Milosevic regime has already launched its own campaign. The target, regional radio and television stations, is an obvious one from a Milosevic viewpoint. Anyone in Serbia' s small and medium-sized towns who wants to see and hear anything other than what is spouted parrot-fashion by the state media based in Belgrade is heavily reliant on these stations. By the way: the few independent papers that do exist are hard to come by in the provinces. This once again underlines the significance of a political counter weight on the Serbian air waves. As can be expected, Serbia' s dictator is fighting his battle against the as yet independent media in an underhand manner. Legalistic arguments over missing licences or outstanding financial state payments mask the true political intentions: to silence his own people as much as possible. What did receive the official seal of approval for the Serbian population, however, were the politically correct pop music stations of Slobo' s son Marko and daughter Marija. Given this sad situation, all those in Serbia who stand up for the freedom of the press deserve our support. This is not just verbal support, but also tangible support in the form of new transmission equipment being provided to the affected stations, following consultation, as stipulated in paragraph 3 of the present joint resolution. Milosevic' s willing servants are then welcome to hold on to the confiscated technical equipment. Situation in Iraq: Mr President, the majority of the Security Council - France, China, Russia - is now in favour, subject to certain conditions, of lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq nearly ten years ago. Imposed on the Iraqi people I should say. The UN inspectors responsible for monitoring disarmament in Iraq have destroyed or ordered the destruction of the stocks of arms, material and products that could lead to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. They have made sure that Iraq has no long-range missiles that could threaten its neighbours. The International Atomic Energy Agency has concluded, after a number of investigations on the ground, that Iraq has no capacity to produce nuclear weapons, as has been confirmed by the reports of three groups of experts on Iraq, and as the UN Security Council' s Resolution 1284 confirms today. That is why our resolution calls for this embargo to be lifted. Nonetheless, the US Government refuses to definitively lift the embargo, on the pretext that Iraq has not respected its obligations. Without offering the slightest proof, Washington continues to accuse Iraq of secretly manufacturing biological and chemical weapons. In response to this concern - which, according to the experts, is unfounded - France has proposed to the Security Council that the lifting of the embargo be accompanied by further inspections relating to disarmament and by controls on Iraqi imports. Washington has refused this proposal too, thus creating a situation which primarily hits the Iraqi people and not their leaders. According to the UN humanitarian agencies, several hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, including some 500 000 children, have died prematurely because of the embargo, for lack of food, medicines or adequate care. For the first time in ten years, an American delegation of advisors and congressmen published a report yesterday, on 14 March, on their return from a visit to Iraq. In it they call for the embargo to be lifted for humanitarian reasons. According to that delegation, the 'oil for food' programme is a totally inadequate response to the urgent physical needs of the Iraqis. Mr Eric Rouleau, the former French Ambassador, speaks of a slow-motion genocide. Our resolution therefore calls for an end to this situation.	fi
Reading the preparatory documents gives rise to certain fears in this regard. These documents state that - please excuse the jargon, but it is not of my own making - there must be greater convergence between the Cologne process on the coordination of macroeconomic policies, the Cardiff process on structural reforms and the Luxembourg process on the coordination of employment policies, and a collateral enrichment of the content of the employment pact and of the multilateral monitoring of budgetary policies. But how can we guarantee greater convergence of all these vastly different processes? The conclusion of the document issued by the presidency on 12 January holds the key. We must revise the broad guidelines of our economic policies - which at present only have the status of an annual recommendation from the Council to the Member States - with a view to amplifying their scope and above all, consolidating their status as a 'framework document' . It would appear that here one should take the word 'framework' as having the dual meaning of 'synthesis' and 'obligation' . Mr President, are we not, with these blanket documents, going down the path of reinventing the broad strategic guidelines? One may well wonder, particularly after reading the French contribution, which crowns them with interventionism, proposing that a whole range of national policies be coordinated in Brussels, such as those on employment, social protection and SMEs, and accompanying them with a vast array of statistical indicators, for which monitoring will have to be arranged. Centralised guidance of this nature would result in further infringements of subsidiarity, increased standardisation of details, and a more restrictive coordination imposed on countries whose circumstances differ, which is to say, eventually, in new inflexibilities which would exacerbate the inelasticity of the single currency. In our opinion, the aim of the Lisbon Council should in fact be to iron out these inflexibilities, to promote flexibility and the ability to adjust, and to exchange positive national experiences with a view to fostering the creativity that can only flourish when peoples are given freedom of choice. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, in the speeches which we have heard a noble aim has been mentioned, that of we Europeans becoming competitive with the United States, of developing ourselves into equal partners with the United States. If we consider our gross national product, that ought actually to be possible. If, on the other hand, we look, for example, at the issue of filling top posts - when it is a question of finding a new Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund - and see how the Europeans behave towards the Americans, then without a doubt we are still a very long way from this equal partnership. We now need to ask ourselves why this is the case. Of course there are sectors of the business world, including the new media, in which we occupy leading positions. Here I need only mention mobile telephones. We have banned them here in the Chamber, rightly, because they are instruments of torment.	el
Just when we thought the discussions had ended, a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which I ask you to vote against unreservedly. According to these, for example, the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea. Others, like Amendment No 4, which request financing for biological closures, also demonstrate a lack of understanding of fisheries regulations by requesting measures which are already in force, although admittedly there is room for improvement in these. I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee' s debate. These two areas are closely related and they suffer the effects of the same environmental attacks. As I have said many times before, the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the Erika. Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report has the virtue of having brought life, debate and controversy to a communication in which the European Commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions, although recognising its inability to put these into practice. Mr Katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which, in his opinion, could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea. Yet I must say that I disagree with many of his proposals because I am with those who believe that it is not just resources which are important in the fisheries sector but also the human beings who have been carrying out this activity for centuries. I agree with the rapporteur that the European fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated. However, what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the Commission and the Member States to take decisions and apply the current regulations. Maritime transport, employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment. As for the Structural Funds, certain examples could be mentioned but I will leave this for another day. The European Parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries. The Commission and Member States should be meticulous in respecting the TACs and the quotas fixed in accordance with objective scientific criteria. The same yardstick should be used for everyone. As Mr Katiforis says, discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept. Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back. The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear. This House has already indicated its opposition to driftnets and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the passiveness of the national and Community authorities. We socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector. It is therefore essential that the Commission launches an information campaign on the CFP with this message.	de
All laudable stuff. There can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance. As a king sport fisherman myself, I would love to see the days of the 1930s come back when anglers from the port of Scarborough in Yorkshire caught bluefin tuna weighing up to 830 pounds. I do not know what the metric equivalent is. So I support the findings of ICCAT and I support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues. My concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst Rome burns. The common fisheries policy is not working. For all of the high-minded talk about conservation, the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster. In mixed fisheries, you cannot discriminate. The sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless. From a UK perspective there is also a deep-seated political objection to the CFP. Many people now feel if this is federalism you can keep it. Let me illustrate this with a topical example. In February, Commission Regulation 394/2000 designed to protect Irish Sea cod stocks was issued. It means that in Fleetwood, 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April. The scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done. However, more than a dozen large Belgian beam trawlers have been granted a derogation from this regulation so the vessels that caused the very problem in the first place are carrying on fishing whilst it is a criminal offence for the UK fleet to do so. The CFP does not assist in conservation and is angering the British public to the point where we demand to re-establish control over our own territorial waters. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Gallagher' s report on the fourth amendment of the Regulation on technical measures was not amended in our committee. It was actually approved unanimously for which I congratulate the rapporteur. This also shows that our committee is in total agreement when it comes to supporting measures which aim to protect species, such as tuna in this case. These decisions must be defended by the Commission in ICCAT. This is why our committee asked to be consulted in advance and to be represented at the meetings as an observer in order to ensure greater and better control and to reinforce the European Parliament' s role. Mr Fischler, I am delighted that the Commission responded favourably to our request in the last and constructive debate which we had on this issue and has asked to attend our next meeting this month to inform us about the future preparatory ICCAT meeting. Our rapporteur' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded. I must highlight the part of the report which states that, in 1975, with regard to the size of bluefin tuna, a minimum limit of 6.4 kg with a 15% tolerance in the number of fish was recommended for the entire Atlantic.	el
It would seem to me absolutely essential to reflect on the scope of the regulation. Firstly, programmes must be more closely targeted at the rehabilitation of tropical forests. The Council regulation of 1995 perhaps focused in too exclusive a manner on the protection of tropical forests and not sufficiently closely on the harnessing of their productive potential. Besides this, future Community actions must take into consideration every facet of sustainable forest management. This implies respect for the indigenous peoples who depend on forest ecosystems. One should never overlook the fact that there are major obstacles to the indispensable involvement of these vulnerable communities: the forest areas in question are often the scene of unrest and conflict or suffer from the adverse impact of tourism, which all too often is held up as a miracle cure, and of local laws on forests which are hardly ever enforced, even where they actually exist. There are, of course, forests in which there are no production activities of any type, but there are also forests that continue to fulfil an economic function. This is the case with our own forests within the European Union, and I would ask my fellow Members what Community aid was provided for European forests after they were decimated by the storm that raged last December? We must without doubt take up the challenges laid down in this report, but must also institute a genuine Community policy on conservation and sustainable management. I hardly need to emphasise the importance of tropical forests at a global level given their influence on climate patterns, the large proportion of the world's biodiversity that is contained within them and of course their importance to the livelihoods of millions in developing countries - fuel wood being an obvious example. For these and other reasons, Europe's citizens rightly expect the Community to support actions to conserve and sustainably manage tropical forests. I say tropical forests, but in fact a new feature of this regulation compared to the previous one is that the scope of the regulation now covers all developing countries and hence now includes countries such as South Africa, China and the Mediterranean and Middle East regions. The regulation also makes specific reference to the needs of indigenous and forest-dependent people and the need for gender considerations to be taken into account. We have just discussed the environment regulation and the comments I made then on a number of horizontal issues are also largely applicable to the forest regulation. For this reason, I will be brief. With reference to the amendments listed in the Fern√°ndez Mart√≠n report, the Commission's position on the main horizontal issues is as follows. Financial reference account: the Commission accepts the compromise figure of EUR 249 million over seven years proposed in Amendment No 9. Comitology - the Commission supports in principle Amendment No 11 but prefers the wording of Amendments Nos 13, 14 and 15. The amendments propose a split comitology arrangement with annual guidelines and priorities being subject to a management procedure while Council would examine projects over EUR 2 million under an advisory procedure.	el
Lastly, during the next Human Rights Commission there will also be a debate on rationalising the work of the Commission itself. A working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission' s mechanisms. This working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous, especially in the financial field. The European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission' s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level. . Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for Geneva on subjects like racism, civil and political rights and the right to development. As the presidency said, much remains to be done, despite the understandable request by Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should set out its position well in advance of the Geneva session. That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues. For example, discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases. It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult. That does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference. However, let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues: the death penalty, Cuba and China. I am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks. We are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission. This has always been a subject about which I personally have felt extremely strongly, I have always voted against the death penalty. Spurred on by Amnesty International and others, one of the first decisions I took as Governor of Hong Kong was to abolish the death penalty. We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly. We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid. The New York stage is different from Geneva. Last year' s debate in New York on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues. It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty. The debate in Geneva, however, is more focused on human rights issues. We may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there. Secondly, Cuba. I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously. We are extremely concerned about moves by the Cuban Government over the last year that have further curtailed public freedom, moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty. We are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions. We are monitoring the human rights situation through the reports of NGOs and the work of our human rights working group based in the EU embassies in Havana. We have regularly put our criticisms to the Cuban authorities, and this Parliament has done the same. But I do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate Cuba. We want a fair and open society in Cuba, a Cuba which respects the principles of the market, the sanctity of contract and the rule of law. We want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. My views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which I wish to deal, namely China. Quite simply, I want us to be engaged with China. It would be self-indulgent and self-defeating, as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity, to want anything else. I also want to see a China transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy activists or religious believers. So what should we do? Naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms.	fi
"Mr President, Commissioner, the peace process in the Middle East is an extremely delicate matter. It will only be possible for the exact borders of the state of Israel, the only democracy in that region, to be universally recognised once these negotiations have proved to be a success. The trade agreement between the European Union and Israel, which equally fails to define the territory of the state of Israel, should be implemented against this background. In addition, there is a significant connection between the economic activities within Israel and those on Palestinian territory. With this in mind, the Paris Protocol to the Oslo agreements also provides for a customs ""envelope"" comprising the state of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Furthermore, the Commission and said parties have agreed to set up a joint working party to discuss issues concerning products' countries of origin. The Palestinian economy in particular is said to suffer under unilateral EU measures. Potential investors in this area have already indicated that they would withdraw if joint ventures were no longer given preference. Mr President, in general terms this House shares the concern expressed in Mrs Morgantini' s question. Commissioner Vitorino has clarified the Commission' s position and, in my opinion, has responded adequately to the concerns raised here. However, I feel that we should not leave the matter there. Starting from this previous statement, the lines of agreement could be extended on the basis of the privileged information which Mrs Morgantini and myself were able to obtain when we accompanied the President of this House on a tour of the area. Firstly, despite the current difficulties which we saw for ourselves in situ, we must repeat our support for the direct dialogue between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority which is producing a fair, stable and definitive peace agreement. Secondly, it is in the interests of both parties to ensure the economic development of the region and to take decisive action to reduce the serious imbalances in the distribution of wealth in the area. Thirdly and finally, perhaps the Commission could bear in mind the usefulness of participating in the work of a tripartite working group, naturally involving the European Union, to guarantee compliance with trade agreements and to ensure progress in the assistance offered by the European Union to all the parties concerned. I have to say that I am satisfied with Commissioner Vitorino' s response: I feel that, on the whole, his speech did respond to the points raised in the question. I agree that we must emphasise the importance, for the European Union and therefore, from an executive point of view, for the Commission, of encouraging tripartite activities, particularly as regards levels of economic/financial and scientific cooperation. In this way, our financial involvement could be converted rather more often into a more significant political presence in the Middle East. This, in my opinion, is the lesson to be learned from such a long-drawn-out affair. With regard to the subject under discussion, I have just heard Mr Galeote and Mr Men√©ndez del Valle refer, respectively, to the visit of our President and that of President Prodi to Israel and other countries in the Middle East."	fr
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Gut√≠errez for his speech tonight and also for his Lisbon initiative, which is very important to us. If we are honest, we must admit that it has been a very long road from Luxembourg to Lisbon, and that really now we are looking for concrete achievements, for something to genuinely come out of this Lisbon Summit. We have a lot of Europeans in the gallery here with us this evening and I wonder what they make of our discussion here this evening. I would like them to take away with them this evening the idea that the institutions of the European Union are now embarked upon a genuine process, which will lead to full employment once again in the European Union. There are many challenges involved with creating that full employment. Some of those challenges will be very difficult to overcome, but the important thing is that we have to turn the rhetoric of what we have been saying for many, many years - about full employment, about a socially inclusive society, about a society that is based on innovation and knowledge - into reality. This is the great challenge, the great importance of Lisbon. I just want to dwell on one or two key aspects that will help us realise that goal of turning rhetoric into reality. Firstly, there is the commitment to having genuine benchmarks, a genuine process of peer review, to the setting of targets, of genuine targets that we can achieve, to governments agreeing to embark upon what is quite a brave process of saying: 'yes, we will allow ourselves to be marked against each other, we will allow ourselves to be marked against the rest of the world' . That really is a brave decision, because some Member States will clearly find themselves towards the bottom of the league table, which is something nobody likes. But this is important if we are to have a genuine achievable outcome from this Lisbon Summit rather than perhaps setting off down another road - a road which I know Prime Minister Gut√≠errez does not want to embark on, because he actually wants to see something achieved in the process of the Lisbon Summit. There are other areas that we must look at. One of these is the challenge of creating an e-Europe which involves all its citizens and does not leave anybody on the wayside. Another is the process of actually having a genuine single market - which we still do not yet have - and skills training that will be the key to delivering that innovative and knowledge-driven society. There are tough choices, but once again in the gallery here tonight, I would like those people listening to this debate to take away with them the belief that we are going to actually have a society based on full employment, that the road to Lisbon will be the end of our journey, and that some concrete results will actually come out of it. I welcome the new strategic goal of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive area. Who could challenge such an ambition? I have to say, however, that dynamism and entrepreneurship as well as social cohesion are a very ambitious target, not to mention the creative tension between those two objectives.	de
"Once the project comes to an end after five years, the policy of free gifts also ends. I think, therefore, that the cost element should be built in right from the outset in the policy of all projects, and as far as I know, this is not the case by any stretch of the imagination. Finally, I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use. Every year, I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund, that they are far behind in spending the funds. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted, which is a pity. We should really talk about coherence in the development policy in the presence of Mr Prodi, for example, who has missed a great chance right from the outset, for he has allowed the development cooperation policy to fragment over three Commissioners - and this is better than four, I have to admit - but this does not really make for a coherent policy. We also note that, as before, there are still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments. The President-in-Office of the Council came up with a good suggestion, namely to budget the European Development Fund. Parliament would, of course, welcome this with open arms. If this were possible, it would be a huge, historic victory. Since Amsterdam, three terms have taken centre stage: complementarity, coordination and cohesion. I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields. If a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion, if a request is made at all, then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult, unless one simply admits that there is no cohesion at all. I would prefer it if a report were to be written on the present lack of cohesion, and if a systematic strategy were to be developed to reach a certain level of cohesion, for it is a long way off yet. One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council. He stated: ""Contradictions in policy can lead to balance."" It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand, and vice versa. But this leads to status-quo and self-deceit, and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes, indeed, but changes which have only made poverty worse. This is supposed to be our priority, would you believe. I know that we do a great deal of good, but let us start with this very essential aspect. Mr President, we have already noted that there is no report from the Commission, but I intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the Council presented in its 1997 opinion. The first is concerned with conflict resolution. For many years, I have tried, through the Council and the Commission, to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in, and working for, conflict resolution in the Western Sahara, which is occupied by Morocco. The UN has a peace plan. We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end. I also want to take up the subject of migration. I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries, which might make it easier to expel immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds. I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms. We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds. Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age. This is not because of a lack of food, but because of what we have talked a lot about today, namely increasing poverty. Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests. I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply, specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason. I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce. Women appear to be completely absent from all areas, especially development policy when, of course, we are not in reality absent at all. Mr President, the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid."	fi
"The overall aim is to achieve quick and efficient results in order to translate policy into legislative acts. The framework for the comitology procedure is clearly established in the abovementioned Council decision. The right of scrutiny for the Parliament is foreseen for areas relating to codecision, that is Article 8. The amended Directive 64/432 is based on Articles 37 and 152 of the Treaty. The new provision concerning the implementing powers for the Commission to lay down transitional measures may have a direct effect on public health. This is the reason why the Commission, in this case, proposes Article 17a which refers to a regulatory committee with the right of scrutiny for Parliament. I refer you to Article 3 of the directive in particular which amends Article 16 of the original where it says: ""where necessary to facilitate the change-over to the new arrangements provided for in this directive the Commission, acting in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 17a, may adopt transitional measures applicable for a period of not more than three years"" . That is, and I am advised by the legal service, the appropriate way to deal with this. In any situation where a basic legislative provision envisages amendment by a comitology procedure it must include in the basic provision the actual procedure for the comitology. That is why each individual provision which envisages such an amendment must identify the procedure quite clearly. Therefore, the power that is given to the Commission to further extend the period of time which is contained in Article 3 clearly identifies Article 17a as being the appropriate article to deal with this which incorporates Article 8 of the Council decision of last June, thereby giving Parliament full scrutiny powers in relation to any such proposal. Where reference is made in the current version of 64/432 to Article 17, this relates to implementing measures concerning animal health, that is based on Article 37 which are of no or, in very few cases, of very remote, public health concern. Therefore these measures should not be subject to the right of scrutiny of Parliament. For example, such implementing measures relate to the approval of procedures and sites for cleansing and disinfection, the format of disease reporting, the approval of assembly centres, the definition of additional guarantees for Member States free of diseases not transmissible to humans such as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis or transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs. I will now make some remarks on the implications of the proposed amendment for the institutional balance. The implementing powers of the Commission are laid down in Article 202, third indent of the EC Treaty in conjunction with the Council Decision 99/468 that I earlier referred to which is the appropriate Council decision laying down the appropriate procedure for comitology. This system aims clearly at defining exactly the respective role of the executive and legislative power in the basic legislative instrument. Consequently, in the basic legislative act it has to be made clear from the outset which implementing measures are based on codecision procedures, that is, Article 152 and which provisions do not have as their direct objective the protection of public health and would therefore not be subject to Parliament's right of scrutiny."	el
After all, what is social justice if it is without full employment? Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens. This is a key priority for us to focus on. I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us: in particular Commissioner Liikanen's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy. Yes, e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs. I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses. That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit. I also welcome Commissioner Busquin's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union. Again, this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity. You said in your summary, Commissioner Prodi, that liberalisation, competitiveness, keeping inflation low, innovation, science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs. I very much agree with you on that, but we can take nothing for granted. There is still more we have to do, and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that. So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme. To me, this Commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle. Unfortunately, it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission. As the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group, I would have expected more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission. The Commission gives no soul to Europe. Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper, despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe. Just a few main points. I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture; they create jobs. I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas, about consolidating and improving the European dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning. Mr President of the Commission, it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe. Nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens. It seems to me that something is missing from this programme. Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real, visible area of training and culture. Declarations of principle are not enough. We need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just described. Madam President, Mr Prodi, how would you take stock of your policy and work programme, what would your benchmark be, if you had to make direct choices? You have the fine, charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections, or rather the turnout at the next European elections. When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say? Mr Prodi, what can I say; what is there that is new? There is nothing new in your work programme. You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year' s work programme. Does that give me hope for the year 2000? No, it does not! In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever.	fi
Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, the purpose of the proposal the Commission made in 1998 is to replace the directive concerning annual inspections of commercial vehicles. The motion proposes the introduction of spot checks, as vehicles have to be deemed roadworthy between tests too. These spot tests may be carried out at the roadside, at ports and harbours or where trucks are parked. This is, then, a matter of improving road safety in the EU, which is vital. The damage caused by lorries in traffic accidents is, more often than not, considerable and the state of vehicles is very patchy in different parts of Europe, so pan-European legislation and strict compliance with it will be of benefit to each and every person on the road. A major cause of concern in the European Union area is the poor state of the trucks coming from Eastern Europe. They need to be dealt with strictly. Being from East Karelia, I know that even if they had one light and the wheel brakes on one side working, it would be something. The Council' s common position will improve road safety considerably, and the directive should enter into force as soon as possible. In establishing penal systems, however, it is important to realise that penalties must on no account be targeted at the Member State, but the driver or company involved. Enlightenment is a good thing, but, unfortunately, only proper penalties have an effect on hypocrites. Road safety is a serious matter. I recall a tragic accident in Helsinki a few weeks ago in which a wheel that had come off a lorry killed a small child. We can never assume too much responsibility when it comes to human life. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, and the corresponding parliamentary committee for the work carried out. It is certain that the rapporteur is entirely correct in saying that the title is very long. The simplest thing is to talk about the inspection of lorries, which is what we are really discussing, and perhaps we should all think about not only putting the technical title in some of our regulations, but also, in brackets, the colloquial title or one that is more readily comprehensible to our citizens, a matter which I shall transmit to the services and which we shall consider with a view to the future. However, on the subject of the proposal, it clearly concerns the roadside inspection of commercial vehicles, both passenger and goods vehicles, with the aim of increasing safety and protecting the environment with regard to road transport within the Community. It is undoubtedly intended to create a structure for the quality of maintenance of commercial vehicles in circulation in the Community, and would discourage operators and managers who try to achieve a competitive advantage by using vehicles in an inadequate state of repair. The proposal requires that the Member States supplement the annual technical inspection by carrying out spot checks in proportion to the fleet of commercial vehicles in circulation annually on their roads. These inspections may be carried out by the roadside, in ports and in other places where vehicles park, or, as is more frequent in the case of public service vehicles, on the operator's premises. In fact, several States already apply this type of inspection, the so-called 'roadside inspections' , in the manner laid down in the directive, that is, in a somewhat unexpected manner. This may in fact be the best way to effectively monitor the state of the vehicles in circulation on our roads. I would like to say that the Commission is aware that Parliament is concerned that this proposal might lead to discrimination against certain transport contractors, or lorries from certain countries or even certain makes of vehicle, and that the intention of the principal recommendation of the rapporteur is for the fines imposed on operators by the Member States to be harmonised as a condition of application of the directive. We share this concern, but we consider that Amendment No 2 is too drastic and, in this respect, we would support Amendment No 3 which encompasses the spirit we are all aiming for, and which, at the same time, offers the necessary flexibility. We also accept Amendment No 1, and I would like to refer to what Mr Bouwman said. In fact, we are tremendously concerned by the fact that vehicles are being driven in the Union by drivers from third countries, and in particular from candidate countries, who do not have work contracts that conform to Community standards, or the standards of any Community country, but simply obey the standards of these third countries, which are often candidates for accession, or sometimes do not even conform to these standards as the corresponding inspections are not carried out by the said third countries.	fi
In my role as chairman of the preparatory group for the ICG, I will make sure to take account of this request regarding the ICG. Turning to your questions about the nuclear power stations in Ukraine, whose names I find rather difficult to read - Khmelnitsky and Rivne - may I remind you that is it for the Commission to carry out technical assessments of these nuclear power stations so as to determine what maintenance is required, or even closure. In March 1994, the Council approved a decision authorising the Commission to contract Euratom loans of up to EUR 1 100 million in order to contribute to the financing required for improving the degree of efficiency and safety of nuclear power stations in certain non-member countries. However, no non-member country has made use of this facility to date. Furthermore, the legal basis for this is the Euratom Treaty, so that there is once again no provision for consulting the European Parliament. To sum up, your questions raise some sensitive problems which, as we know, have been discussed in this House in recent years in the context of increasing its powers, and Parliament has been using its budgetary authority as a legitimate source of pressure. As regards the specific instance of KEDO, let me remind you that in 1998 Parliament blocked the funds for that year, and it was only possible to overcome this problem by means of a compromise with the Commission, in which the Commission undertook to inform Parliament, at the beginning of each year, about Euratom agreements being negotiated, so that Parliament could consider them. Thank you, Minister. Just to continue on the question of the IGC, Parliament will probably ask, under institutional reforms and especially the chapter on decision-making procedures, to have assent for international agreements and codecision on other matters. So do you have a feeling about how these discussions may develop in the IGC? Mr Turmes, the extension of codecision on legislative matters is an issue which the Intergovernmental Conference has been considering and, as you know, the more radical position traditionally adopted by many Member States is that all legislative decisions adopted by a qualified majority in the Council should be submitted to the European Parliament under the codecision process. Although this position has been explicitly welcomed in the ICG, there are some Member States who advocate a case-by-case approach on the use of the codecision procedure, even where legislative decisions are concerned. With regard to ratification of international agreements, I have already been able to raise this issue at the ICG, and when it was first discussed this request and traditional position of the European Parliament did not receive what might be called a ready welcome from the Member States. Although this item is still on the table, as all these issues are kept on the agenda until the end of the conference, it does seem to us at this stage that there is unlikely to be any significant progress on this. Nevertheless, we will continue to maintain a dialogue with the European Parliament on this subject. Next Tuesday I shall be attending a meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs at which I will make sure to discuss this issue and to explain in a little more detail how the ICG preparatory group is dealing with questions like this, and in particular the list of requests and proposals presented by the European Parliament, which we hope will be supplemented by the resolution to be voted upon on 23 March. Question No 6 by (H-0160/00): Subject: Compensation for victims of fascist war Many rulings by Greek courts have confirmed that Greek citizens are entitled to compensation as victims of the nazi regime, while the war reparations which Germany owes Greece remain in abeyance and have not yet been paid. Repayment of a loan which Germany extracted from the Bank of Greece during the occupation in 1943 also remains outstanding. In the light of the recent agreement signed by Germany on compensation of DM 10 billion for forced labour in German industry, will the Council take steps to ensure that the victims of the fascist war are given their rightful compensation and that the loans extracted during the occupation are repaid, bearing in mind that, since the unification of Germany, not even the formal reason that Germany adduced for not settling these legitimate and valid claims now applies?	fi
Action is not limited to legislation. To encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the Commission is also developing the recommendations of the Lillehammer Report by preparing the setting up of a European observatory on industrial change. We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group, the Managing Change Report. Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House. As for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy, let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers' representatives to be heard by the Commission in the framework of the relevant procedure. Generally speaking, we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations, including their effects in terms of employment. As an example of this I mention that public authorities, notably the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment. To this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years. The same provision was included in the Structural Funds Regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds. Social cohesion and the interplay of policies at EU-level is the focus of the forthcoming Lisbon Summit. I know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe. Thank you very much Commissioner. Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I understand you have a point of order. If it is a personal statement, would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate, at which stage I would be happy to call you? Mr President, the problem is one of public honour in this Parliament, it is not a personal statement. This morning, the President of Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Madam President has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me. In doing so, Madam President has breached Rule 142 that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak. She has also breached Rule 122 that gives the right to all the Members of this House to make observations, observations which in this case refute the remarks made by another deputy, Mr Vidal-Quadras. This partisan behaviour of our President should be criticised most firmly. I will willingly accept Madam President' s apologies any time. Thank you for your statement. We will certainly make sure that the President is informed of your statement. I can assure you that as far as I am aware the President never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote.	de
Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive does indeed, as many speakers have already said, represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the jumble of piecemeal EU regulations and directives and achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe. However, I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation. I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental points. First OSPAR. We know that the Commission proposal does not go far enough; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment. Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough. What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR. Only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and, more importantly, objectives which are enforceable under the law. Anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters, such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary, from happening to us. I find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection, despite having agreed internationally on OSPAR. But I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament, in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised. It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth. We must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry lobbyists; on the contrary, we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and, hence, cost-covering prices. Water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the OSPAR convention. With closed production circuits this is possible; anything else would water down the directive. Let us grab our chance. Mr President, in the small amount of time allotted to me, I would like to welcome the Mrs Lienemann' s report and remind the House of three principles, to which all other principles must be subordinate, which are clearly expressed in the rapporteur' s amendments: water is not a commercial product, but the property of all the peoples of the Union; the ultimate objective is to eliminate all pollutants in surface water and groundwater, and to inform the public so that it can participate in the recuperation of water and not use water excessively given that it is such a precious commodity. I know that this directive may have problems, given the differing situations of the various countries of the Union, as has already been mentioned. The situation in the north is different from that in the south, and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas. I understand this.	el
"I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well, and the result, which we have received today, is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area. This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4). If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand, least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought. The Treaty is a collection of complex articles. However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize. At the same time, it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community' s financial interests, as Mrs Theato has explained very well. We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful. As the French say, ""ne jettons pas le b√©b√© avec l'eau du bain"" [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water], that is to say, in the protection of the Community' s financial interests, we must respect, on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizens, which affect the essential guarantees. The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly. Therefore, in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission. Mr President, this, as Mrs Theato said, is a critical report. It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report. One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement. It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is. We need to do something about it. Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget. A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done. We need to take this responsibility seriously. We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union. The question is: who prosecutes? That is where we really get into difficulty. Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers? We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States. The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one. We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people. But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions."	de
Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO. One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course. The Treaties also point in that direction, although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar. We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar. Actually, I hear less and less about this. I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment. It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation, which would work very well. But is there not more to it than that? I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence. The European pillar does not really function any more as such. Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks. Is this actually how we want things done? Moreover, whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union, there is no longer any mention of Article V, which is, of course, of direct concern to us. Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg. Will it be omitted? At the same time, an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets. I think that this is to be welcomed, but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider, collective defence tasks. I wonder how this will develop. I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future. Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling? I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy. I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy? The fabric of Turkey' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities. That would seem odd to me. Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door. Will they also take part in our defence policy? It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least. High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force. However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further. I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference. A word of warning to the latter: this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation. We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management. At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing.	fi
(The President cut the speaker off) Mr President, given the disastrous vote just now on the chocolate issue, I must say that I am not particularly proud of what we have approved. It should be pointed out that the European Parliament has taken responsibility for altering the very composition of chocolate by allowing the introduction of vegetable oils and fats other than cocoa butter. The European Parliament is clearly not in tune with public opinion in several respects. Firstly, its position does not correspond to the demands of consumers who want clear labelling. We have not granted them this labelling on chocolate. Parliament is also not in tune with public opinion which is becoming increasingly reticent about GMOs. We have rightly refused to allow GMOs in chocolate, but only by three votes. In addition, we have applied the precautionary principle by refusing the prior studies on the impact which this directive will have on the producing countries and so on. Nothing has changed. The question to be asked is who really benefits from the manipulation and ... (The President cut the speaker off) Mr President, I taste sweet victory for British chocolate producers in our vote today in their fight to have good British chocolate recognised across Europe as the delicious, high-quality product that it is. The victors are not just British chocolate makers but chocolate consumers right across Europe who will now be free to wallow in the delight of Dairy Milk, Galaxy and Milky Way at will. Clear labelling will enable consumers to choose and enjoy the chocolate that they want. Their taste buds will no longer be deprived by Europe's chocolate police. Developing countries are also the victors. This legislation takes account of the needs of the world's poorest farmers. Those vegetable fats permitted will be of tropical origin, and there will also be a review of the impact of the directive after three years. Best of all, the directive will increase chocolate sales overall, thereby increasing the market for developing countries' exports. So chocoholics can now munch safe in the knowledge they are doing their bit for the Third World. I am sure you will agree that the EU, in the past, has got itself into a right Twix on this matter. Some governments have got their Snickers in a twist trying to protect their chocolate industries. For them, however, Crunchie time has come and they now have Creme Egg on their faces. It is high time the European Parliament gave two Cadbury's Fingers to the chocolate snobs. - It is now sixteen years since the debate on chocolate started in the European Parliament. I believe that we should not even have become involved in this directive. Debates about national tastes and products give us too far wide a sphere for ridiculous discussions. Consumer choice will be exercised regardless of what the EU does, and that is only fair. National chauvinism has been all too often evident in the chocolate debate. The European Commission' s directive authorising certain vegetable fats which are cheaper than cocoa butter to be used in the composition of chocolate clearly serves the interests of the five multinationals which share three-quarters of the European market.	el
"It is therefore perfectly reasonable to raise the question of whether, when we talk about the problems of the new knowledge-based economy and of the new digital economy, which, as far as I know have created unemployment rather than employment in Europe, we are not replacing an inability to deal with the problems of unemployment in the present by what has largely been - and still is today - empty rhetoric about the problems of employment in the future... No one understands better than us the crucial role that the Internet, the digital economy and the knowledge-based economy have to play, but these issues were not what the Employment Summit was originally intended for. Mr President-in-Office, you concluded on a vaguely ideological note, which is fair enough. If this is the Social Democrats' policy for the economy of the future, then I would like to remind you that one of the most serious problems of the Internet economy and Europe' s lagging behind is the lack of entrepreneurial spirit in the education system, in the behaviour of governments and in the way the institutions function. This is what we must counter if we are to guarantee the knowledge-based economy of the future.  Mr President-in-Office, first of all, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament, particularly as your presence here symbolises what the Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists has already referred to. By that I mean the political symbolism of the fact that during your tour of the capitals, you have also come to listen to the European Parliament. This is not the first time during the Portuguese Presidency that there has been a different and politically stimulating relationship between the Council and Parliament, but this is a significant gesture which, as my friend and colleague Mr Bar√≥n Crespo noted, we were delighted to note. Our position is clear: we support the Portuguese Government' s initiative. We support it because it is a serious initiative and because of its substance, both in terms of strategic objectives and in terms of other objectives with which we agree. Furthermore, the way in which this European Council is being prepared is a good illustration of this. Firstly, there is the seriousness and depth of the document presented in January. Then, there are the various preparatory conferences and the contributions that both business and union leaders are making towards this summit. In particular, there is the latest contribution to research that was made at the recent meeting which brought together Nobel Prize winners and Ministers for Science and Technology. This shows that the Portuguese Government is preparing for this Summit seriously and is paying a great deal of attention to its substance. However, we also support the initiative relating to the summit' s main objective, which has already been mentioned. We do so because for the first time, it is not only putting the issue of employment and social issues at the centre of the European debate but is once again suggesting that ""achieving the objective of full employment"" is in the realm of the possible. For years, many people have said this was impossible, that in modern society it would never again be possible. My congratulations, Mr President-in-Office, for making this issue topical once again without rejecting social cohesion and values which we hold to be fundamental, because they are not only at the heart of the founding project of the EU, but they are at the heart of our civilisation and, above all, of our understanding of the need for solidarity between all Europeans."	de
Article 3b of the Maastricht Treaty, President, still confines subsidiarity to the relationship between the European Union and the Member States. Regions and stateless nations are ignored. People within their own communities therefore suffer. They are unable to establish the structures they need so that human rights can prosper and the blight of racism can be forever removed. In own nation, Wales, for example, we have no empowerment to establish our own laws to counter racism and defend human rights. The principles of cohesion and the drive to limit poverty and depravity in our communities are a well-settled concept in the European Union. However, it must encompass respect for minorities everywhere if it to inspire the world in its drive towards defeating racism and defending human rights. A heartfelt thank you to the rapporteurs for their work. More and more, we need to follow our words with actions. Disrespect for human rights, racism, xenophobia and antisemitism are not confined to other continents, but are also present here, within ourselves, our lives and our institutions. Even in this Parliament, fascist and xenophobic opinions are expressed. We must start with ourselves if we want to build a world where everyone helps each other. We will be able to intervene more effectively in countries which deny the existence of human and social rights - whether these are the rights of Kurds, Palestinians, Chechens or the rights of Afghan women - if we avoid hypocrisy. Europe is full of Haiders. We are Haiders when, to give the minor example of an incident which took place in Rome last week, Bosnian Roma refugees are deported with the approval of the mayor and sent back without aid to places of conflict; children and mothers, brothers and sisters separated, without even the time to gather together any belongings to take with them; children born in Italy snatched away from their schools where they have become integrated and made good friends with the other pupils. We are Haiders when, in Rome, parties of the right-wing opposition and the new centre incite the people to hatred and prevent the authorities from accommodating the Roma safely in places with running water and electricity. And this does not mean that I do not condemn the unlawful behaviour of many Roma and other immigrants. I would like to be able to share with everyone my conviction that, in our countries, no one is a stranger. For this reason I give my full support to the proposals contained in the resolutions which promote and lend support to all those elements which contribute to a culture of peaceful coexistence and all-embracing citizenship. Mr President, I should like to concentrate mainly on certain aspects of the Belder report, which contains an excellent analysis of the current situation in the candidate countries. As far as these candidates are concerned, and this has already been said, we must avoid creating the impression that we demand higher standards of them than we meet ourselves. We should compare the actual situation in these countries with the reality in our own countries rather than with our perfect legal texts, otherwise the candidate countries will always come off worse in practice. Certainly nobody contests the fact that candidate countries which, for example, only acquired their independence recently, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, have the right to redefine and articulate their own national identity first. As the Communist dictatorship under which they previously suffered obviously did not foster a culture of pluralist debate, many forms of expression of national identity appear to us to be overstretched or even to be directed, indirectly, against minorities within the country or in one or more neighbouring countries. We should not look down from our high moral horse and condemn this phenomenon as long as it is only a question of temporary manifestations on the path towards self-definition. However, we should give these countries en route to the EU the specific support that they require so that the self-awareness which they need to find is not based first and foremost on negative restrictions on minorities or neighbours. I should like to use the situation in Estonia and Latvia as an example of a positive development between two sections of the population which is by no means self-evident.	fi
I will end now. I will not expand further. We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions. But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done. As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety. The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers. Thank you very much, Commissioner. We have taken good note of your intentions. I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m. Storms in Europe The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe. Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission. Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward, particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union, in terms of the help that we can offer them. In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2. I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it. In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid. We should therefore put this situation right immediately. You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one. Let me explain. I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest. Indeed, for some 'forestry' districts, which have lost 20% of their trees, this represents a huge loss. We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more. The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years. I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues. I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.	fr
The creation of Europol represents one step towards achieving this objective. However, we must take the next step, which is to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to gradually establish a genuine European judicial area consistent with the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice. This draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application, at Member State level, of pre-existing conventions on other legal areas. The intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the Member States and in the European Convention on Human Rights. It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue. As for videoconferencing, more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded. The procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights... (The President cut the speaker off) Mr President, legislating in criminal matters is often countered, wrongly, with arguments of individual freedom and security. Is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed? Is one free when security is no longer assured? Modern criminal law revolves around the quest for a balance, a dialogue between security and freedom. And this dialogue is open-ended; it adapts to the demands of the day. Nowadays, certain forms of crime are cross-border crimes and it is, of course, in the interests of the Member States to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them. But the Council' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts. First, the form: the draft convention is vague in the extreme, and this is totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society. It is not just a question of style. We are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter. Then the content: the Council draft fudges the obvious difficulty caused by widely differing legal systems, varying practices and a total lack of legal public service standards in certain Member States of the Union. It makes provision in article 9 for prisoners held in custody to be transferred from one state to another despite the fact that guarantees differ. I should like to stress this point because it is paramount. We must not forget that several tens of thousands of people are currently held in custody in the European Union without having stood trial and that, in some states, custody is abused and used as a means of extorting confessions. It is nothing less than legal torture. Other European countries, on the other hand, do not accept confession as sufficient proof of guilt. It is this diversity in our criminal policies which we have to address and legislating properly means looking for genuine legal convergence criteria and facing up to the reality of prisons in Europe, which are often overcrowded places outside the law which are a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves. Mr President, as you know, all of our countries abolished the death penalty years ago, but with nearly a thousand suicides a year in our prisons, they have not really abolished it? Mr President, co-operation in the field of law is without doubt essential in free market Europe, but it must hinge on the strictest respect for those principles which lie at the very heart of our civilisation: the fundamental human rights and freedoms, laid down in the European Convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We can but thank the parliamentary committees, which have - via the introduction of numerous amendments - made far-reaching modifications aimed at providing guarantees to a report which, in its initial format, we did not find at all convincing. I turn to Mr Schulz in confirming that we always submit amendments not on a personal basis or for personal motives, but in connection with general political concerns.	fi
The policies of the European Union also have much to answer for in this situation. Of course we need to modernise these systems. In France, in particular, we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions. We also need to reform archaic management methods which create injustices, chaos and waste. More importantly, we need a family policy to promote demographic growth and an economic, monetary and fiscal policy to promote growth and reconquer the internal market so that we can create jobs. The Commission and the Andersson report are not proposing a social policy; they are giving Brussels exorbitant decision-making powers as regards funding, i.e. as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of Europe, which is why we voted against this text. Social protection should be an expression, first and foremost, of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost, exclusively in fact, under the jurisdiction of the nation state. Social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences. Otherwise it is merely the financial processing, at the expense and to the detriment of European citizens, of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration. . (SV) We have abstained from voting for Jan Andersson' s report on a coordinated strategy for modernising social security. We are basically well disposed towards the European Union. As Swedish Liberals, we see European integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management. In these areas, Europe' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity. We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect. That is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see. It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with, which is to say cross-border issues. All other questions ought to be dealt with at local, regional or national levels. Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU ought only to have limited powers, except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union. Each Member State ought to have full responsibility for, and the right autonomously to decide upon, its social security systems. Health care, child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational. The same applies to labour market policy. We do not believe that common European legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security. For us, it is important that the EU should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use. That does not, however, prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere. Equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our Liberal agenda. We wholeheartedly support, at national level, many of the ideas presented in Mr Andersson' s report.	de
There are, therefore, serious grounds, over and above justice between the sexes, for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women. Women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue, reconciliation, an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means. These female virtues can offer an alternative to today' s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone. That is why the Intergovernmental Conference must introduce into the Treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the European Union and in all democratic institutions and political decision-making centres throughout the Community. Mr President, why do women need their rightful share in political decision making? And how should we achieve this? We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary. It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and, as such, a condition for political legitimacy. But if we look into how to achieve this, the opinions are greatly divided. Is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment, much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties? And is it then up to the state, in other words the legislative, to impose such measures on political parties? Or should we even consider a system in which 50% of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies? This discussion, which is being held in some parts of Europe and here too under the French banner of parit√©, touches the very core of democracy, and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman. In my opinion, the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level. I am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists, without which, in fact, I would not be here today. Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure. In my opinion, though, the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties, at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself. In other words, the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid. We would, in this way, violate democracy. . (PT) Mr President, I am grateful for the liveliness of the debate on this issue, the ways in which it has been addressed and the positions adopted on it in this House. Members were prepared to discuss rather than simply raise questions and we have heard some valuable insights into the topic being discussed. We have all recognised that if democracy is to be strengthened, it is crucial for women to have greater decision-making powers and to participate more in the decision-making process. This was universally acknowledged. The differences of opinion were about how this objective can be achieved.	el
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House. She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House, there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full, formally and in detail for everything I have done. Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report. Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance, as several Members have said, to all of our Institutions. I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative. Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence. Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary. When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission's reform proposals. Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today, well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago. I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that. The great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform. There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile. The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance. I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode. But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing. Hence the transmission. Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas. Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.	de
That way, we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms. Parliament' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that, with the Union' s institutional changes, we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union. They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone. The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive. It may be easy to come up with solutions, but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term. I will mention two point that may create tension. One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries. Europe is not, nor can it become a classic federal state. The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union, which is a union of states and peoples. The other area of conflict is more difficult. Owing to the imminent increase in membership, the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective. This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly. By its very nature, however, the European Union is, and will remain, a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution. Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist. Of course they do, but they are not unlimited. If the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness, then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer. I am, however, optimistic. Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened. The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union. It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union, which will, however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned. The Commission' s former president, Jacques Delors, has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation. He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions, for the sake of clarity. The Commission' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines. Last November, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe: the onion skin model. In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility. Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party. My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand. I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions. This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about. May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament. A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly.	de
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega. I too wholeheartedly regret this situation. Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government? This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly. Madam President, I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday. I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union. Absolutely, Mr Napolitano. Thank you. Madam President, off the subject of aeroplane delays, I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Caroline Lucas, who is a British Member. She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow. Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent, she was still held in custody all day. I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology. I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala. Thank you, Mr Lannoye. I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative. Madam President, I should like to make a request in connection with today' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report. I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point. I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL. We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning. Madam President, to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made: Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane. I have a lot of sympathy with that protest. I have, however, no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity. I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane. I did not hide behind any immunity. I took the punishment that came to me. Mrs Lucas should do the same. Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow. In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee, and, given that it is a major Commission proposal, which refers to the agreements we reached last year, I consider it admissible. We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible.	fr
Last autumn, we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force. I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing. I hope that this discussion will, in the first place, concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied. When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament' s and, as I understand it, also the Commission' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo. The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management, an idea which has already been translated into practical action. Another, at least as important, lesson of our experience, however, is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently. Therefore, the EU must also have an independent, credible conflict-prevention capacity. On behalf of the Commission, Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction. I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations, together with a Commission Crisis Centre. My last question to Mr Solana is this: what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind? How have these been organised by Mr Solana' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission? Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders. I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian, peace-keeping and peace-making tasks. But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe. Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights. I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament. You must lay these concerns to rest for, as you yourself have said, when we are able to present a united transatlantic front, we are in a position to do something. When we are divided, we are weakened, and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged. So, maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway, Turkey and Canada, either. You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers. As George Robertson has said so often, we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo. It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war.	fr
Firstly, I would like to say that there is an enormous difference between, for example, producing cars or lorries and producing a film. We are aware that film production is dependent on aid, as it is a combination of culture and commercial production. We also know that European film, particularly when produced in languages with few speakers, cannot easily maintain as large a film production as one would wish. Therefore, aid for both national and European film production is extremely important, as is the opportunity to continue the practice of accepting up to 50 percent State aid for film production. I would, however, like to ask the Council's representative whether he does not consider it important, with the help of this practice, to be able to give up to 50 percent in aid to the production of European film in those languages with few speakers. Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, I am of course especially conscious of the point you have made about the Union' s smaller Member States. We are also concerned about this. As you know, in the past all the Member States of the Union were authorised to provide special support for their film industries, particularly bearing in mind the specific need for cultural diversity within the European Union and because it was necessary to ensure that account was taken of this specific need, thus going beyond a purely economic view of the film industry. We hope that it will be possible to maintain this support in future, and we also hope that this can be totally reconciled with the new WTO rules, especially in the new round which we hope will start sooner or later. At present, there is still a 50% limit on state aid in relation to the overall cost of any given project, but this percentage could even be raised to 60% in special cases envisaged in the programme. At the moment we have no indication that the Commission is considering a lowering of this limit, let alone the amount and the percentage mentioned by the honourable Member. Question No 8 by (H-0166/00):  Subject: Information for the public Will the Council draw up a list of parties which the electorate can safely vote for without running the risk of their country being ostracised? Mr President, it is clear that the European Union does not have the power to intervene in the constitutional arrangements of the Member States, no more than it is for the Union to draw up a so-called positive list of parties for whom electors may vote. If we went down that path we would certainly be entering very dangerous territory. This does not mean that the idea behind this question does not make some sense politically speaking: in some countries, including my own, a Nazi or fascist party does not have the right to register with the constitutional court. This means that it cannot be accepted as a legitimate party in the democratic process. Other countries have different systems and these have just as many virtues as my own.	el
An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd. It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which, at 2%, is now at its maximum permitted level. If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again. What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular. High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting. Promoting employment, however, is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy. Member States, in particular, should adopt an effective policy. In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway. Rigidity by imposing social convergence criteria and other Community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs. However, shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution. Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us. Not the report he presented to us here today, but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because politically speaking, these are two completely different reports. In very general terms, we could call the first report a left-wing one, as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones. The report we have before us now and which Mr Katiforis is reluctant to defend - and I think that he is right in this - is a hybrid report, from which the main conclusions have been removed, and is based on social concerns. What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report? He proposed an ambitious report, based on an optimistic Europe, which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve. And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets. Why, for example, was the proposal to increase Europe' s active population to 75% of the total population removed, when we currently have levels of around 60%? An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries' levels of production with such a low rate of employment. We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive. As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training. We also need investment to grow at a faster rate. We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce. I would like to counter this with the example of Portugal, where employment laws are not flexible, and where unemployment stands at less than 5% - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing, with Community support of course, at a rate considerably higher than the Community average. What we want, therefore, is for Europe to enjoy economic growth, but also be prepared to address social issues. Mr President, like many others, I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report. When I read the report and see the picture of the EU' s economy that is described there, I think it is quite a worrying picture. Investment levels are too low, unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth. It is not, therefore, perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies, in spite of rumours to the effect that the European Central Bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it. The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself, which is something I agree with. There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development. As far as I am concerned, EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy.	fi
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage. From that standpoint, it is useful that the Commission' s work programme comes back to the issues of Agenda 2000, the common agricultural policy, which includes fishing, and secondly, the activities of the structural funds. I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000. The Agenda 2000 issues are, of course, ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives, the economic and social Agenda and a better quality of life. What your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major, high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deploy. I do not necessarily mean financial resources. The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money. There must also be savings. But what we need is the analytical resources: these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital. This is because it is essential to achieve two things: the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured, and this must be done in a way which facilitates the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products, mainly to the benefit of developing countries. It is not easy to combine those aims. There is no obvious way. There may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them. As regards the other aspect of Agenda, the aspect of cohesion and regional development, there we do indeed have great achievements to point to, but there are still less developed regions, particularly island regions, to which more attention should be paid. As for fishing, there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the predatory exploitation of fishing grounds, which has gone as far as to wipe out entire species of fish, will certainly prove fruitful in the future. Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse. Madam President, I want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan. In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present. That was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group, Mr Poettering, in his opening address. The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place. That foundation is clearly the single market. How strongly is the single market established at the moment? I want to remind Mr Prodi, and his colleagues who are still here, of the findings of the Commission' s own survey among 3000 European businesses. Nearly 40% of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications. This is the Commission' s own survey. These are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments - bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry. The Commission' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market. We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers, intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and, of course, extending into crucial new areas like financial services. Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved. An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union. The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement. I conclude by saying, on behalf of all my Conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task. Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today. The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme.	fi
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet, according to our information, no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date. This is serious, since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo. Finally, and this follows on from what I have just said, we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis, monthly, regarding progress on payments made. We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments. It is not firm commitments that we need, just plain commitments would suffice, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, more especially, what has not been paid. Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment. Mr President, if we are going to discuss Kosovo today, as we have done many times before, then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo, or of whether in fact anything has been done at all. What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality, and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate. As of 9 February, there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council, which will comprise representatives of the political parties, the minorities and civil society, and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament. This is a positive move and we welcome it, but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare, for elections are planned for the autumn. No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result. No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-√†-vis UNMIK. In other words, there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either. Of all people, it is the Albanians, who are now being integrated into the transitional council, who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them. In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work, urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs, Albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the Roma of course - in this country, so that at some point in the near future, on the road to coexistence, it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place. I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about. Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors. That is excellent news! There too, people are being encouraged to pay their taxes, for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources. It should also be noted that of the 19 departments, 4 already have administrative leadership, which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto. There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law. We have 130 judges and public prosecutors, who have now been sworn in, and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice, with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little, and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions.	de
Mr President, I must confess that I am extremely unhappy that we are not going to vote on this motion today. With every passing moment, we are rushing towards the danger of a military clash which must be avoided. I called for the issue to be debated during the last part-session, and I wonder at the fact that a month passed before our socialist friends managed to reach a consensus with us regarding a motion, even though there should not have been any difficulties as we agree on the basic points. Nevertheless, I realise that it is also important for us to achieve as great a consensus as possible in order to give our governments a firm basis. However, I call for no more time to be wasted, for I would not like us, as has happened in the past, to once again have to discuss what we should have done to preserve peace once war has already started. Mr Buttiglione, if I may summarise, you are confirming the note the Chair has received in the meantime, on behalf of your Group, and in agreement with Mr Na√Ør, to the effect that this resolution will be withdrawn. But the debate will continue, regardless of what is going to happen in the next part-session in April and which I hope will accord with the political wishes the two of you have expressed here. So the debate continues and the resolutions are withdrawn. Mr President, I too am sorry that the vote will not now be taking place. I am concerned, as are the other speakers, at the plight of the people in Iraq. One should never forget that the plight of the people in Iraq is being inflicted upon them by their own government. We should not forget that in January this year Parliament passed a resolution asking that the Kuwaiti prisoners of war still imprisoned in Iraq should be released or at least that details should be given to their families and that there should be compliance with the United Nations resolutions. That has not happened and we must be quite unequivocal in sending the message to Iraq, and indeed to the people of Kuwait, that we in Europe are not going to forget and are not going to ignore the plight of those people still being improperly imprisoned in Iraq. We want to make that message as loud and clear and unequivocal as we possibly can. Mr President, the UN sanctions have become a weapon of mass destruction, claiming at least 200 children's lives every day. Dennis Halliday, who resigned from his position as director of the UN humanitarian mission in Iraq in protest at the sanctions, confirms the UNICEF statistics - five to six thousand children die every month as a direct result of the sanctions. Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has been speaking out against the sanctions imposed in violation of international law, which prohibits the starving of civilians as a method of warfare. She says: 'How can you expect me to condemn human rights abuses in Algeria, China and elsewhere when the United Nations themselves are responsible for the situation in Iraq?' The UN economic sanctions have denied Iraqis spare parts to restore infrastructure, making water and airborne infectious disease rampant.	el
And therein lies the difference with the Council, which is saying that a contribution has to be made. But a contribution might also only mean half a euro and in this case God knows this would be too little. Nothing would change. There would be no financial pressure on ships to obey the rules. What is needed is a standard waste disposal fee for all ships irrespective of how much they actually use the disposal facilities, meaning that the financial incentive to dispose of waste at sea has to be removed, which - as has already been explained here today - was possible in the Baltic Sea through the HELCOM Agreement and the 'no-special-fee' system. If it can be done there it must also be possible for it to work for the remaining European seas, because this is not only about the environment: it is about clean waters, it even has consequences for tourism and - the decisive point - alongside the environmental issue it is also about fair competition. The same conditions must apply to all ships in port and only if Parliament, the Council and the Commission create these conditions together will this fair competition be restored for ports and ships. I think that this is also about the credibility of the Union and, in particular, Parliament. I think that people are tired of seeing the hypocrisy of Europe and of ministers each time that there is a catastrophe, as we saw of course with 'Erika' . Oil comes onto the beaches and then politicians and ministers appear and try to clear it up themselves with a tiny little bucket, but when a fortnight later a robust directive is up for debate they have forgotten yesterday's fine words. We will not be able to rule out accidents altogether, but we can take optimal precautions. This consistent directive is an important step towards doing this. I also hope that our liberal colleagues will perhaps reconsider before tomorrow whether they might not - including for reasons of parliamentary identity - join us once again as they did in the first and also in the second reading, because we will then be going into the conciliation procedure anyway and there we will have to see how much ground the Council can give. I believe - for environmental and competition reasons as well as on the basis of the decisions made two months ago, in January - that we should adopt these amendments tomorrow, in the form in which we debated them in the committee, with a broad majority. Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, congratulations on your report. You have said so yourself just now: we desperately need this directive. It is a sound directive. Ports must be equipped with reception facilities. Inspection is on its way, at long last. Member States must also impose sanctions when these rules are broken. This is very important. This is good for the environment. Investments are already being made, in anticipation of the directive. For example, in Antwerp, very near to where I live, a huge installation is being built which was not there before.	el
"These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy. I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society. The rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based. Terrorism, whatever form it takes, is unacceptable. In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain. I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe one minute' s silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge D√≠ez Elorza. (The House rose and observed a minute' s silence) Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I want to thank you for your statement last Tuesday and for your words today in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco. He was a member of the Basque regional parliament, spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government. Madam President, the best tribute that my Group and this House can pay to Fernando Buesa is to take on board his vision, as a European, of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe. The following is a translated extract from his autobiography. 'We are in Europe. Anyone of my age - I am 54 - can remember their grandparents' era and their parents' era and, of course, is living in the current era. We can also see into the era in which our children will live. In my grandparents' time, it took several days to travel from Vitoria to Seville. Now you can go from Vitoria to Copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane. Today, at the end of the 20th century, a single market is operating in Europe in which we will soon be using a single currency. We can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within Spain or even within the Basque Country. We are building a vast European area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically. This process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and, what is more, desirable. The public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation. In a debate within the Socialist Party on the Irish process, someone said: ""In the end, the key to the Irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought: does it really matter whether we are Irish or British? Everyone can be what they want to be because, if Ireland and Britain are both in the European Union, there is no point in killing each other for being Irish or British. What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function?"" We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question. Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European? We have talked a lot about what it is to be Basque, but a Basque today dresses like a Dane and reads the same things as a British person. If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis, as is already happening, and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating, why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish?' Fernando Buesa also said the following, which everyone in Ireland has probably thought. 'If we are killing each other for no reason - and this was happening in Ireland because there were paramilitary groups on all sides - we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the Basque Country too. What difference does it make to be Basque? Surely it is all the same thing. You can be what you want to be. If, in the future, economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the European arena, there is no point killing or dying for being Basque or Spanish' ."	fi
At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end, and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies, where we fit into UN agencies and so on. We need to open that debate. In conclusion, this morning, the day after St Valentine's Day, the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over. I do not know whether you are a romantic or not, Mr Prodi. Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning. However, we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business. That is the way it should be. Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me, in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues, give in one adjective, one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance: an enabling Europe. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally. You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme. I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones. At the same time, however, it has to be said that, unfortunately, your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto. There are a lot of good intentions in it, but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved. As in any other party manifesto, it is full of contradictions. I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them. First let me speak about the economy and social development. We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment; that is what was mentioned in your programme. Should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria, in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than, say, the three most successful countries in this matter? Ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of, because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure. But, unfortunately, as we all know, this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act. Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference. The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone. In this respect, Parliament will definitely defend, along with yourselves, the importance of supranational decision-making. One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation. I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of 'global administration' , as others too have said here.	fr
The basic aim of the communication is twofold. To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles. We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism. The Commission' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental, human, animal and plant health. Of course, this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures, but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear. As such, while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science, as some have alleged, it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics. The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society. It is therefore political by nature. However, the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper. Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is, we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut. They must be non-discriminatory in their application, that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin. And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken. For example, if one product has been approved, similar products should also be approved. Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action; that is, the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment, that is the burden of proof. All these elements have to apply cumulatively. It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures, which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle. For example, a research programme, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on. Applying the precautionary principle does not, therefore, automatically imply a ban. This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use. By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle, we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level.	el
We would be changing the law to make it executable again, which is something I consider to be unacceptable. The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions. Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption, insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty on European Union allow. The requirement to lodge applications in Brussels will be dropped; in other words, the Commission will be completely in the dark in future. This is unacceptable to my mind. The Commission' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States' courts. But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy. This is unacceptable in my view. It would weaken a key element of European policy. The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned. There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition. In any case, the Commission' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties. There was no majority for this at the time. Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time, it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy. Forty years on, this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies, to the detriment of Europe' s consumers. I consider this to be unacceptable. Mr President, in this important debate on competition, I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen' s document on the Steel Aid Code. As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996, the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances. Indeed, several years ago, this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector. This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses, even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty. This indeed, is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code, but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid. It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research, development, environmental protection and cases of company closure. In the same category of ideas, it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies. The Commission suggests shorter deadlines. I agree with this request. Like the rapporteur, while I am pleased with the Commission report, nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid. Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code. In the interests of equality, either the Code must be applied or it must be modified. Finally, and in conclusion, Mr President, with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002, and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area.	de
We could, as the Commission has proposed, accept these overlong deadlines which the Commission and the Council have extended even further. Yet if we do, we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public, but these efforts will be postponed until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be deferred again. It is clear that in this event the objectives will never be achieved. I am stressing this point because, when disasters are being reported daily in the news, we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that Europe did not act when it should have done. Then, in our haste, we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time. The current example of the Danube and the pollution from Rumania shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development, clear requirements, controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers, this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time. It is also clear that if we do nothing, our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner. Even now, the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism. To conclude, the issues are clear at this second reading. Do we or do we not want standards compatible with OSPAR, in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero? Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive? Do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water? Do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples? The majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives. I hope they will be supported by this House. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us, especially as the very source of life for human beings. The problem is one of both water quality and water resources, of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe, especially in very dry regions. I am sorry that Commissioner Wallstr√∂m, who is responsible in this area, cannot be here now because this is, after all, a very, very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time, and water protection legislation, which we are debating now at second reading, affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join, who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede. We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994. A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers.	el
We must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future. This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries. We hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission, with plenty of action and no more regrets. This House will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups. Mr President, the shipwreck of the Erika off the coast of Brittany on 12 December caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years. In addition to destroying natural resources, this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors, particularly those dependent on fisheries. With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel, the situation could still deteriorate. The consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming ashore. These consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself. The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance. They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which, unfortunately, is not an isolated event. The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature, which is nowadays too often being punished by man' s activities. These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities. Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes. Surely the budget would agree, as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these. Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked. Yet on the issue of the Erika he has given the impression, perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vend√©e, that, as the Fisheries Commissioner, he is not always available or, at best, available only on a part-time basis. As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January, the needs of the severely affected fisheries, ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account. We therefore now call upon the Commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds. Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks. We cannot understand how it is that experiences like the Urquiola or Amoco Cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience. Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this. We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen. The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate.	fr
This body was established back in March 1969 and is formally obliged to meet biannually, however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice. The body then makes recommendations with a view to maintaining stocks. This body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics, finances and administration, compliance and conservation and management measures. They have also four panels dealing with tropical tuna, with temperate tuna, the north and temperate tuna south and other species. These panels are powered to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention. Proposals made by the panels are then presented to the Commission and the Commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties. These conditions are binding, however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six-month period. The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law. At a ICCAT meeting in November 1998 in Santiago de Compostela, changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna. ICCAT also made recommendations in 1974, 1994 and 1996. As of now, it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1.8 kilos. At its recent meeting in November 1998, the ICCAT standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna populations. The information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans. It was agreed that the SCRS should present a study at the 1998 meeting. It was intended that this meeting be presented with various possible recovery options with a view to maximising sustainable yields by taking into account alternatives or possible levels of recruitment and mixing of stocks. It was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine, in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock. Following all of the research, the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the Mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 August to 31 August. It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations. Bluefin tuna is the world' s most expensive fish fetching up to EUR 90 000 per ton at the auctions in Tokyo and, of course, the indication of the importance of the Mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons. 80 percent of it was landed by purse seine. The Mediterranean is an important spawning area for bluefin tuna so therefore it is important that the necessary measures be taken to enhance the protection of juveniles. The minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age. The measures agreed in November 1998 are binding since 21 June, I repeat 21 June 1999, months before the communication was forwarded to the Parliament' s Fisheries Committee and 9 months almost to the date.	fr
This calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached, with great difficulty, with the Council in December, according to which, when the Commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction, the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary. I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach. I would like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that Commissioner Solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme, with the corresponding report, requested by Parliament, so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up, as we have been promised. Lastly, I would like to insist that, although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now, we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough, and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo, which is so badly needed. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse my late arrival, but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the pity. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million, and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need. The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there. However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process. Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents. Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions. I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future. It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this. However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here. One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims. In other words, we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres. Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there, we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into. This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations. It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected. This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there.	el
The Euro-Flower is just one element of the broader environmental strategy that is needed to save our planet. Our citizens want to see concrete action. They do not want to see mere hot air from politicians, which just adds to global warming. By harnessing Euro-Flower power, we can all contribute to a cleaner, greener world. Recommendation for second reading of the Blokland report (A5-0056/2000) - Blokland rightly raises serious concerns regarding waste disposal, including incineration. Coming from a country with over 90% landfill use, I face the conclusion that properly controlled incineration is both necessary and inevitable. Commitment by the Irish Government to serious recycling and separation of waste is far from evident. Separation of waste, including use of organic waste for composting, must be a priority in any waste strategy. Waste management is a very complex issue subject to extensive lobbying. This is why the European Union has adopted a comprehensive strategy to tackle this major environmental and health challenge. The directive before us today is part of this strategy as it aims to regulate the thermal treatment of hazardous or non-hazardous waste. I myself have always been doubtful about the incineration of hazardous waste being dealt with in the same legislation as the incineration of non-hazardous waste. I therefore raised my concerns and questions at first reading. Regrettably, in my opinion, a majority has approved co-incineration. This is why I am now fighting for measures to be adopted in order to guarantee that emission standards for hazardous waste will not be diluted. Everyone knows that the volume of waste to be incinerated in the European Union is set to increase. Thirty-one million tonnes of municipal waste were incinerated in 1990 and this figure will be in excess of 56 million this year. There are several reasons for this, including the increase in the volume of waste produced and the fall in the quantity of waste sent to landfills. It is well known that the incineration of waste causes emissions of substances which seriously pollute the air, soil and water and which are therefore dangerous to health. The pollutants emitted depend both on the nature of the waste to be treated and the technologies used to treat this waste. This is why our concerns focus on the emissions of heavy metals, dioxins and furanes. The debate has particularly crystallised around co-incineration plants. These use hazardous waste as fuel for the production of energy or physical elements. Although the provisions of the applicable directives impose a maximum limit of 40% of hazardous waste in the fuel used, this percentage is too high! These plants must be subject to very strict control standards, at least as strict as those imposed on incinerators. In addition, the generalised use of this hazardous waste must not lead to the production of this waste becoming acceptable. We are at great risk of being told in the future that, as investments have been made to build these co-incinerators, we must now make these profitable! I firmly reject these arguments in advance as they will lead to an increase in the volume of hazardous waste being transported with all the risks which this entails for the environment and safety. To conclude, although offences must be penalised and authorities must be assisted in bringing their incinerators up to standard, it must be stressed that our priority is, and must, remain the prevention of waste production, whether this is hazardous or non-hazardous waste. - The European Union has been at the forefront in devising new waste management strategies in recent years. In fact, the object of the directive we are discussing here today is to reduce the adverse effects of incineration on the environment and on human health by considerably reducing the emission levels of several major pollutants into the air. This directive also seeks to control the discharge of waste into our water systems. This report is now before us at second reading. I note that one of the recommendations from the European Council is that, if an operator of a plant incinerating non-hazardous waste intends to start incinerating hazardous waste, an integrated pollution prevention and control licence must be secured.	fi
- (FR) Women suffer increasingly from inequality since they are the victims of the sexist discrimination which can take an overt form (violence, rape, sexual harassment, domestic violence, etc.) but also a more insidious one. This oppression is based upon a sexual and social division of labour which values men' s work more than women' s. Wages are not equal, women' s work is still perceived as 'stop-gap' work and, more generally, female employees do not have access to the same positions of responsibility as men. What is more, women bear the main responsibility for family matters. Women must be entitled to full time employment on an equal footing with men. Mandatory legislation must be adopted in order to encourage equality in the workplace. States must develop a public service offering childcare for working mothers. Finally, in order to enable everyone, men and women, to become involved in public life, working hours must be drastically reduced. We need real equality between men and women in political, economic and social life. We are opposed to the idea that the biological differences between men and women should give rise to two different world views and two different value systems. Women have the right to be involved in the decision-making process as 'individuals' and not as token females. - I, together with my colleagues in the British Conservative delegation, am totally committed to the need to have more women playing a full and active part in public life. We share in all expressions of regret that there remains inequality and gender discrimination and especially under-representation of women in politics. However, we are not convinced that one form of discrimination should be countered with another form of discrimination, namely the introduction of quotas to guarantee women elected places. I feel this especially keenly as only on Tuesday evening of this week my 27-year-old daughter, Caroline, was selected as the prospective Conservative candidate for the Southampton Itchen constituency in the United Kingdom. She achieved this position totally on her own merit and in open competition against all-comers. We should not adopt a position that in any way detracts from the position of the increasing number of women who are demonstrating that without fear or favour they can earn their place in public life. For this reason members of my delegation have supported much of the resolution but we registered our opposition to those calls for positive discrimination in favour of women, which we think is the wrong way to make progress, is itself demeaning to women and distorts the democratic process and we have therefore abstained in the final vote. Katiforis report (A5-0041/2000) Mr President, I voted for the Katiforis report on the European Union economy in 1999 to toe the group line, and also because it reveals an extremely serious deficiency which I hope it will contribute to eliminating during the next few years. However, the report does not fully explain, or rather it does not explain at all, that the economies of the States of the Union also and, above all, depend on the way in which pension contributions paid by workers are used.	fr
I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference, not merely to relations between the Union and Member States, but also the Union, the Member States, regions and cities. I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe, Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears. Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms. Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this type, form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki? I do not think so. Are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion, unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking? Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission. I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated. In terms of social protection, I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology. In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people. This will therefore be our rule. We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic. I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues. I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical. This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27. Mr MacCormick, I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals. It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots. If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity.	el
Throughout this conference, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important, but the quality of what they will be saying. And once again I should like to point out in this House, in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament, prior to Amsterdam, the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations. I am sure that the situation will be just the same and, as far as I am concerned, in my current position, I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations. I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be. We now await, therefore, with great interest, ladies and gentlemen of the House, your next opinion, in which you will specify Parliament' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations. It is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negotiations, the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other, alongside the Council members, explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continually, every day, what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as European institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest. In the coming months, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation, on good terms, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok, in order to reconcile our points of view, if need be. Quite probably, our points of view and our positions will not always be the same. There will probably be differences of opinion, that would be only normal. The important thing is that we are consistent, and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner. Our concern and our ambition, therefore, on a large number of subjects, is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully. This will not be a matter of chance, since, let me repeat, I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union. Finally, I should like to make three additional comments, quite briefly, Mr President. Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate. Such dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important. I have said, furthermore, that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments.	fr
If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive, this would be very detrimental, not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament' s credibility on environmental issues. Reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries, for example my own country, Sweden. I was myself a car worker before I was elected. I believe I am one of the few members of this Parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars. I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry. These would, of course, be to the advantage of modern, progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms. It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union. Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament, as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe. There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment. Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests. Each year, there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union. This in itself generates a large amount of waste. Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars. We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union. From an Irish perspective, I know that the Irish Department of the Environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicles. I see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across Europe for collection centres to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disposed of within the European Union on an annual basis. Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use, recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years. In accordance with new provisions included in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 370 million consumers within the European Union have a right to consumer-related information. I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year. My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations. Mr President, the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe. I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials, a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation. In this regard, we are certainly on the right track, but as some Members have already stressed, the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers' responsibility will become a shared responsibility.	de
Mr R√ºbig has the floor. Mr President, fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions on another Member State, because a democratically elected government was formed there. Both parties were once part of the government. So far there have been no infringements of the law. Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights? Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council, in respect of the formation of national governments, be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights? Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights? Mr R√ºbig, as President-in-Office, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union was adopted bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union. Nevertheless, I would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States was actually a set of actions of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level. We feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which, although it has become part of a European Union government, does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the Union' s aims. I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency, because my government intervened at the request of, and in conjunction with, fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity. Mr President, I have the honour of being a member of the Convention drafting the Charter so I am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the Convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force. What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up? Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document? Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter? - (PT) The answer is neither yes nor no. I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council. Question No 8 by (H-0042/00): Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits. These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects. Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process? The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.	fr
Subsidiarity must be seen to apply: it must be clear that we are not legislating where it is not necessary to do so. The second concern relates to budgets. Given the higher growth rate than was predicted in the financial perspectives, which are based on 2.5% growth, we can see our way forward to taking slightly different measures on budgets than we would otherwise have done. On behalf of my group I would like to caution the Commission not to go ahead at this stage with shifting agricultural expenditure from category 1 to category 4. In Britain in particular we have a farming industry which is in desperate straits and wants to see some assistance given to certain sectors of agriculture: shifting money for agriculture from one part of the budget to another at this stage would be to give them a wrong message. Lastly, a word of caution about the question of information. This is what bedevilled the relationship between our Parliament and the previous Commission: the fact that we, under the Treaties, have access and the right of access to all information in principle. It looks as if we are running into difficulties with our framework agreement. I therefore stress that, if we want to have the Commission and Parliament working together, we have to be able to come up with a solution to this problem as soon as possible and not to have limitations on documents which are available to citizens. As Mr Bonde rightly pointed out, we should have a European Union where there is a free flow of information from the bureaucracy to all our citizens. Mr President of the Commission, when you entered upon your duties, you said that the Commission would be characterised by openness. A lot of other people have also said that here today. But what is the situation now? Why are the Commission' s press conferences no longer being broadcast directly via satellite television so that everyone in all parts of Europe can follow what is happening? I hope that Mr Prodi is listening. Regarding your letter to Mrs Fontaine about the ombudsman, Mr Prodi, do you consider that the ombudsman is bound by any principle of loyal cooperation between the institutions? Where, in that case, do you find a legal basis for this view, and do you believe that such a principle can suppress the ombudsman' s right to express himself freely in the press? I also want to provide the following piece of information about your letter to the Wall Street Journal, in which you refer to a seminar in April on openness as proof that the regulation concerned has been prepared openly. That seminar was, in fact, organised by the European Federation of Journalists and by MEPs L√∂√∂w, Thors, Hautala and others, but the proposal which was discussed there had nothing to do with the current proposal, which has been prepared very much in secret. The main question, however, is that of whether the principle of loyal cooperation should take precedence over the right to express oneself. Where is the basis for a principle in accordance with which you could suppress this right and make such demands upon the ombudsman? Mr President, the report you have presented is ambitious and complex, and I will only touch on a few points.	de
Why would I not say that we have noticed in previous years, on the part of the Greek Government, some shortcomings in the application of the new Regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society? I am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted, this must be remedied. I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework. - Question No 45 by (H-0041/00): Subject: Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period, 1994-1999, no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas? Can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period? What role will aid from the Structural Funds play, on the other hand, in the promotion of renewable energy? Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional, renewable energy sources? Will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission networks? On Mrs Isler B√©guin' s first point I must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the Community' s priorities during the previous programming period. The support allocated by the Structural Funds for technological cohesion, or research and technical developments, within the Community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately EUR 7.5 billion. This is about 6% of the whole Community contribution. With regard to your specific concern, I can say that, as in the previous period, the Commission does not intend to directly finance through the Structural Funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission. However, it is still the responsibility of the Member States' management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these CSFs. Consequently, even though this is not a Community priority, a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area, provided that these projects contribute to regional development. The Commission does not have to be systematically informed of these. On your second point of renewable energy which, as you know, is of great interest to me, the Commission' s approach is given in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds. These Funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources, where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level. I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit I made to the Azores in Portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy. The Structural Funds contribution which has enabled greater penetration of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the Transport and Energy Department.	fr
"We have three outstanding problems. The first is the transfer of water between basin areas. That is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Amendments Nos 4. 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed, be that arid areas or urban areas. Secondly, we have to have realistic targets, but targets nevertheless. Looking at Amendment No 7, for example, which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances, you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic. Also, some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English, that is quite a meaningless term. We need to look very carefully at those. The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better. Thirdly, I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky. Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky, which is the best - requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream. Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk. We must make sure that Amendments Nos 49 and 87 leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in ""high quality"", which means it must use good, Scottish peat water. That is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole. Mr President, first of all, we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water, but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against Yugoslavia, aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded, have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too, making them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous. Turning to the report, we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata, or even in the annihilation of small and medium-scale farmers because of the prohibitive cost of water for irrigation. We also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country, and especially on the islands, funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water, by increasing not its cost but its quantity. This should mainly be carried out by collecting the rainwater that now goes to waste, running off into the sea and eroding the soil, with all the problems that creates. In that spirit, we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos. River waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought. Finally, as regards the Council' s allegation, which the Commission echoes, that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein, this is chicanery. Its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action, which during the directive' s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business."	de
Mr President, I need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points Mr Coelho made. All that is indeed very true and correct. It is easy to counterfeit the euro. We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history. It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already. Yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such, counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence. It is a highly complex problem. If we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschi√∂ld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation. Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people. So what is the European Union doing about it? It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschi√∂ld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschi√∂ld, but more at the procedures that are being applied. The manner in which the Council, which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy. We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment. Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months. It is only thanks to the immense efforts of Mrs Cederschi√∂ld and to Parliament' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages, that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the Council, so that the decision scheduled for March can indeed be taken. On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us. So let me state quite clearly here, on behalf of my group, that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschi√∂ld whether it is reasonable to work like this. We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure. This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress. Only, as Mrs Cederschi√∂ld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited.	de
"What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous. In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution. That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system. Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise. I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area? I cannot answer that question. When it comes to medical checks and so on, I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer. What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned, that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan, but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that. Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information. Question No 30 by (H-0793/99): Subject: Appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in exile received over 4000 Tibetans who escaped over the Himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb. Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way. The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet.  The Tibet Intergroup, therefore, gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama?s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet, calls on the Commission to appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue. When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet? Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission. The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared. I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues, including Tibet, firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities. The European Union did that at the European Union¬≠China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues, including Tibet. We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama. I urge the Chinese again to do so. We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities. We are also doing a number of other things: in the European Union-China human rights dialogue, we have focused on a number of practical steps, including sending experts on assignment to Tibet, planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health, education and training for Tibetans. The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them. But for my part, I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts. It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile. I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, however worthy the cause. Mr President, Mr Patten, of course, you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China, and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate, something which has always been blocked hitherto. However, if your response was to be that we should turn to ""Mr CFSP"" , that is, to Mr Solana, then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter. Your approach, which I am very much in favour of, since it is a coherent one, takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights. Imprisonment, torture, the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth, are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum."	fi
In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006, which is being financed from the Social Fund, both the resources and the policies should be used, with the Commission' s support, to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier. The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made. Thank you, Commissioner for your reply. However, our current situation is as follows: at 11.3%, we have the second highest unemployment in Europe, which was not previously the case, we have the biggest increase in unemployment, we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed, i.e. less than 1% of GDP, while other countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany spend 3-4%, and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used, inter alia, to combat unemployment. You tell me that you, as the Commission, have made recommendations. I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to. However, my question for a very long time has been this: what happened with previous policies? Did anyone find work? How many people found work? If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before. What has been done about training? Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees? Do we have any figures? In other words, do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece? Mr Papayannakis, the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies. Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and, as far as I can see, an increase in productivity. The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines. As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated. They concern access to training, the ratio of men to women with access to training, and special action for the long-term unemployed. The Commission will endeavour, for all these specific guidelines, to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006. Question No 36 by (H-0782/99): Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy? The Danish pension scheme, the Efterl√∏n, only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire. Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire. The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law.	de
The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004). The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million. I support Mrs Lienemann' s firm stance. The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created, even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement. If the report is adopted in plenary session, then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme. This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions! B√∂ge report (A5-0023/2000) . (FR) As an MEP and, more importantly, as a consumer, I welcome the European Commission' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union. This proposal has two objectives: first, to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and, secondly, to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species. What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie. What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis. I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs. These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie. A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic. Even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective, especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie, it is still a notable improvement. It is a pledge to European citizens, who have voiced their concern, as regards European food policy, on many occasions. The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard. As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution, traceability, responsibility and transparency, the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety. This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence.	fr
Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion. It is high time there was peace in the Middle East. It is time to end the era which began with the Balfour declaration in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. It is time there were secure borders and political, social and economic rights in every country in this region, and that human rights were recognised and upheld in Syria, Palestine, Israel and everywhere else. This is an exercise in sovereignty, and in democracy for each population and every individual, but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights, and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given. I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question, but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982. Israel has to accept its responsibilities, withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but, at the same time, it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area. However, Israel is not the only country concerned with security. The same goes for the other countries, especially for the Palestinians, who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas B and C, despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements. Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999, 174 000 dunams of land were confiscated, 8 462 of which have been taken under Mr Barak' s Government. Trees have been uprooted, houses are still being demolished and, above all, water supplies have been reduced or refused, especially in East Jerusalem, while the settlements continue and are growing constantly. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that with the election of the new government, positive steps have been taken: negotiations, at least, have resumed. But in the Middle East, there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state, if they cannot move freely within their own territory. All the international community has to do is implement Resolutions 332, 248, 245 and 194. We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria, as well as Mr Barak' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el¬≠-Sheikh agreements. We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid. We cannot be content with a role backstage. We must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the United States, as Minister Gama said.	fr
One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course. The Treaties also point in that direction, although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar. We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar. Actually, I hear less and less about this. I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment. It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation, which would work very well. But is there not more to it than that? I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence. The European pillar does not really function any more as such. Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks. Is this actually how we want things done? Moreover, whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union, there is no longer any mention of Article V, which is, of course, of direct concern to us. Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg. Will it be omitted? At the same time, an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets. I think that this is to be welcomed, but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider, collective defence tasks. I wonder how this will develop. I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future. Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling? I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy. I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy? The fabric of Turkey' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities. That would seem odd to me. Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door. Will they also take part in our defence policy? It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least. High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force. However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further.	fr
"Of course, we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness, but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment. I think the statement' s content makes this clear. Ladies and gentlemen, the aim is that in the next year, and after a unanimous decision by the Council, we should progress to a first level of coordination, exchange of views, listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies. As many of the speakers have said, I believe a first important step has been taken. Already at the Intergovernmental Conference, social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase, in which social policy will, to a large extent, become a European policy. Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. WIPO treaty The next item is the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs Cederschi√∂ld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)]. Mr President, we are now taking a stance on an important issue, an international agreement, which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many Member States. In my own country, Sweden, one of our biggest export industries is affected, namely the music and sound recording industry. It is about artists' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products. It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty). Without protection under intellectual property law, creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed. Forgeries are big business. It is estimated that, in Europe alone, income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy. The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry. This is an historic agreement because the EU is the contracting party. This is the case, in spite of the fact that it is not the EU, but only the Member States, which belong to the organisation. There exists a special clause which requires Parliament' s assent in two cases. With regard to the present agreement, both these conditions are fulfilled. A new institution is being created, an assembly which, in the future, will monitor the agreement and its consequences. The agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure. Parliament must therefore give its assent, because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence. The future will show whether it is right, by means of this new parliamentary assembly, to reduce the Commission' s powers regarding these issues. Parliament cannot, in any case, at present do anything about the matter. The agreement complements the Berne Convention in regard to literary works. It creates international legal protection in connection with distribution, sale, rental, public reproduction and the making available of works. It also creates protection for software and databases. There are problems regarding the term ""author"" . For example, it has not been defined. Another issue, which is somewhat problematic, is that of intermediate storage. This too has not been solved. It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition."	de
When the USA and NATO and, finally, also the EU, reacted, it was already late, in fact very late. A great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the EU, among others, has acted earlier and more decisively. We, the European Union, therefore have a special responsibility to help, support and rebuild the Balkans now. Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU - economically, politically and in terms of trade. Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration. We Liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly, just as Paolo Costa reported. It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report. Macedonia deserves our support, especially in view of the self-sacrificial, disinterested work which the people and leaders of Macedonia undertook during the Kosovo war. Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms. We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans. This is an urgent duty for the EU. Mr President, allow me in this context to remind MEPs - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war, human degradation, murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia. The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free. I am talking about Milosevic. As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path, Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans, including in Macedonia. Mr President, the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe, Its terms, which the Swoboda report accepts, are certainly not directed towards peace, but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country, and towards controlling its natural wealth, overexploiting its workforce and continuing to use that country as a springboard against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order. All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union. The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe. It is characteristic that the report congratulates FYROM on the constructive stance it maintained during the NATO attack, eulogises its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for NATO forces, but, of course, remains silent about the indignation of its people, which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the NATO bombardments.	fr
The answer is a lot. Mr President of the Commission, on reading your White Paper on the reform of the Commission, it is clearly apparent that the guiding principle, the philosophy behind this reform, is something very vague which we cannot accept in this Parliament. This guiding principle is mainly the protection of the Community' s financial interests. That is clearly of concern to all of us, but it is only a starting point. From there on, the Commission must begin to work, and must fulfil its obligations in accordance with the Treaty. Allow me to give you an example, since the speaking time allotted to me does not give me much opportunity to expand on this idea. Let us consider the intended reform of the infringement procedure. What is the intention there? It is simply to administrate the existing resources on each level, instead of hearing this Parliament' s demand that we should create a genuine administrative procedural law for ensuring legal certainty, which is necessary from the point of view of the European citizen, that is to say, from the point of view of the people who may have recourse to this infringement procedure. It is simply said that this administrative procedural law will not be created, but rather demands will be selected. How can this be? How can these things be selected in a purely arbitrary way. From the point of view of this Parliament, this type of arrangement cannot be allowed. We understand that the Commission has to be reformed. We agree with the objectives of this reform. However, it should not lead to the abandonment of the great momentum of European construction, for the sake of protecting the Community' s financial interests, however important we may all agree that that is. The Treaty obliges the Commission, primarily, to provide that momentum. Thank you, Mr Prodi, for your presentation and your documentation. Congratulations on using the Internet for the general public - a very good idea. I will start with trade. We agree with you that we need a rules-based trading system. It is essential. Seattle failed because the United States, in particular, appeared unable to grasp the legitimacy of policies such as environmental protection, the preservation of rural communities through the common agricultural policy, animal welfare, health concerns and social rights. It displayed incredible insensitivity to the legitimate concerns of the developing world and, frankly, the developing world has little so far to thank the WTO for. We expect the European Union to continue negotiations, maintaining our strong positions on all these issues and using our links with countries in the developing world to ensure that the next round is a fair round. Please, can we have detailed proposals in the next three months about how this will happen. Innovation and knowledge - very appropriate for a new century. How much innovation has taken place in the Commission, or indeed in the Parliament may I say? We had a White Paper on innovation some years ago - what has happened since? One thing I would like to say very strongly is that we are very concerned in follow-up, not simply in excellent communications, which we welcome, but in follow-up, follow-up, follow-up!!!!	de
We call for economic support from the European Union for the independent press, but also an economic aid programme for Serbia, to assist the entire afflicted population and to help make it possible for the people of Serbia to at last live in peace and to elect a democratic government. Mr President, I believe that we are all of one mind today as to how this topic should be handled and the way the media are being treated in Serbia. The situation in Yugoslavia is deteriorating by the day. In fact, it seems as if Mr Milosevic and his friends are playing a three-way game by means of which they are trying to deregulate anything which can possibly be deregulated. Tension surrounding Montenegro is mounting. At Kosovo' s border, the situation is very unsettled and the regime in Belgrade is creating a climate in which large-scale accidents are likely. The last few weeks have been marked by a series of repressive measures against the independent media. This ranged from high fines to direct intimidation. In addition, there is talk of a kind of internal isolation. It is increasingly difficult to enter the country. I experienced this myself a couple of weeks ago when I tried to attend a few conferences of opposition parties in Serbia. During that weekend, I was refused an entry visa whilst, two weeks prior to this, many international guests had been able to attend that bizarre conference staged by Milosevic. It shows that every effort is being made to keep out outside influences. There is also talk of curtailing communication by telephone, e-mail and keeping tabs on written correspondence. The government seems keen to remove the opposition from local authorities, where they have been entitled to be since the previous local elections. The new regime can only win the new local elections, expected in May, if the opposition is, in effect, eliminated. I find this a dangerous game. Consequently, we would like to see extensive protests against this media repression, but the EU should also look for ways to provide direct support to Serbia' s independent media. The latter is a vital lifeline for the opposition which will be mounting campaigns again this spring and which certainly deserves our support, also where the media is concerned. Mr President, we have started a new round - the umpteenth - in Milosevic' s war against the free media. So much is clear. It seems to be heralding the elections in a perverse kind of way. The campaign has started and anyone who disagrees with him needs to keep their mouths shut. It is really unacceptable that elections will soon take place - allegedly formal, democratic elections - in a country where the opposition has first been left without any tool to express itself. It is a trademark of a totalitarian regime which knows all too well that free, independent media are a nuisance and pose a threat, even to a regime such as that of Milosevic. The EU' s support - on which we are probably all agreed - can roughly take two forms. It would be beneficial to support the media in the neighbouring countries: Croatia and a number of other countries have been mentioned.	el
This is more than an economic challenge: it is a process of profound cultural change which must filter down to every family, every school, every company and every public authority. In order to achieve this objective, although, on the one hand, we do need to promote the spread of new technologies, on the other, it is essential to implement the necessary measures and reinforce the confidence of consumers in the major opportunities presented by e-commerce. There is a genuine need for this, given the suspicion with which our fellow citizens approach these new tools. A high level of protection is essential for the effective spread of the use of new technologies to the daily lives of millions of people, and clear rules will have to be defined if European citizens are to be able to take full advantage of the benefits. In this regard, I had submitted a series of amendments for the attention of the Committee on Industry intended precisely to stress the importance of consumer protection in the project for disseminating new technologies put forward by the Prodi Commission. It was with regret that I learned that only some of these amendments had been included in Mrs Read' s report. I am, however, in agreement with the main points of the report, and I do hope that this omission was due to the unfortunate circumstances which meant that my Committee, which deals with consumer protection, did not have time to produce an official opinion. I trust that during work on the action plan, following the Lisbon Summit, there will be more effective cooperation between the two Committees. Mr President, Commissioners, if every possible attempt is made - and rightly so - to establish ways of creating an information society for everyone, we should make just as great an effort to ensure that we do not end up recreating a dual society with IT literates on one side and IT illiterates on the other. Moreover, I set great store by protecting small and medium-sized businesses, with special emphasis on the small businesses. In this connection, it is important to ensure that guarantees are provided for advertising purposes. Indeed, due to a lack of a harmonised policy on commercial communication, obstacles could well surface which cannot be negotiated, particularly by small businesses. Far-reaching harmonisation concerning commercial communication is therefore urgently needed. In the last instance, I would also like to underline how important it is that at least the parties involved, i.e. the consumer and entrepreneur, must always be able to make prior arrangements regarding the applicable legal system. After all, if it is stipulated that consumers can take legal action within their own jurisdiction, then this situation will be untenable for small businesses, which will need legal assistance in 14 other Member States. Needless to say, small businesses cannot afford to make this kind of arrangement. Mr President, with the e-Europe initiative, the Commission is reminding us that Europe is lagging behind in the development of the information society.	el
In terms of social protection, I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology. In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people. This will therefore be our rule. We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic. I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues. I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical. This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27. Mr MacCormick, I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals. It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots. If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity. We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions. Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this. It specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam. It also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies. The Commission is acting correctly if, on a particular point, it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions. I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7. However, if we do, this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the Union must mobilise together to give their response. We will also do this with regard for the future in general. We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War. Everything which can be done will be useful. I am sure that you and I, Mr Berthu, can at least agree on this.	de
If the European Union is to become a community of values - if we are to play a true role in the new global governance, then we need to be promoting the values of the Geneva Conventions not only to our own soldiers and security forces, but also to people in our civilian societies. We need to be pushing for the creation of a permanent international criminal court and urging our own Member States to sign and ratify the Convention. We need to be working hard to combat racism and xenophobia. Liberal Democrats in this House are proud that three of the authors of today's reports, Mrs Malmstr√∂m, Mrs Haarder and Baroness Ludford have grappled with these issues and given the House these reports today. We live in hope that the twentieth century, which Europe has soaked in blood, can give way to a twenty-first century in which the power, the genius and the enthusiasm of humankind can be applied to the construction of a more just, peaceful and sustainable world. Mr President, I am in sincere agreement with what was said in the previous speech. Yesterday, we were talking about a Charter of Fundamental Rights; today we are speaking of human rights. Yesterday, in one excellent speech, someone said that we have a moral obligation to defend and develop democracy and human rights. What this moral obligation actually entails and the extent of our efforts and commitment will, however, come to light in the context of that wretched reality represented by wars and armed conflicts. Over the last century, these have totally changed in nature. Humanitarian law is that yardstick by which we can show whether that moral obligation is just some kind of rhetorical stimulus for us or something that leads to deeds and action. Today we are hearing the case of Albin Kurti, of Kosovo. The Geneva Conventions are a vital part of this minimum level of action. We also have to ensure that both the Ottawa Convention against Land Mines and the Charter for an International Criminal Court are ratified. Mr President, in response to a question put to him during a radio interview on 20 January last, the Russian Ambassador to Paris declared that what the Russians were doing in Chechnya was fighting terrorism and that Europe and the whole world would subsequently thank Russia, when they understood the issue. Personally, I cannot see any reason why the European Parliament should be thanking Russia. On the contrary, I feel that it is necessary for Parliament to condemn Russia more emphatically and clearly than before, and that not only the Community institutions, but also the national governments should join us in doing so. It was with sadness and regret that I learned of the feeble, unconvincing protest at Russia' s treatment of Chechnya and subsequent embrace and encouragement given to Mr Putin by Tony Blair, a man held in high esteem throughout the world, during his official visit to Moscow a few days ago. At a time when we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of a great landmark in humanitarian international law, the Geneva Convention, we cannot ignore that fact that all the points of the Geneva Convention are being violated on our doorstep, even though the Russians may say that this is not a state of war but a state of emergency.	el
As for internal reform, you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one. I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform, if it does not become more efficient, if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors, starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid. Providing aid rapidly, when it is needed, saves human lives; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all. When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems. My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner' s efforts, of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication, but I also think of new events, such as Croatia, where the situation has changed in a few weeks: the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia' s problems, but more particularly Serbia' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia. This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans. We must increase our efficiency in this area. We must reopen the Danube to boats. It is contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource. We must decontaminate the river and, in view of this, over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem. We have done a lot in the Balkans: the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo, the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures. Nevertheless, we definitely have to do more. We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic, pluralist society in these countries with institutions, public structures, police forces and a structured civil society, but, above all, we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region, as regards both politics and the economy. If we do not do this, we shall have failed in our duty. Remember that the Marshall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources: it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horizon; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy. This is what we need to do for the Balkans. Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security, peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage.	fr
And I make the point, before I move to my questions, that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because, of course, the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions. That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process. Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock, if I may. The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms. Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern. Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside. And if we are to move forward, I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side, early evidence of change of culture, empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later. And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations. Indeed, it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced. I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that. The second point that I want to make concerns information technology. Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms. On the second part of Mr Harbour' s question, he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement. Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials, which is already very strong, will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training, the allocation of responsibility, the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing. Cultures are products of structures and systems, and the structures and systems have become old. By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before. I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour.	fr
I want, finally, to say that I had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the Austrian Government but, when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees, I have no misgivings. I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time. Mr President, during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999, when there were 13 different initiatives in operation, the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative. The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe, a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States. The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States. Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland, I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III. The Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme, which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years. The European Union is the single largest contributor, with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland. The European Union contributes 75% of the Peace and Reconciliation programme. All in all, INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process. Mr President, I am taking the floor to speak about INTERREG, but I shall confine myself to a few criticisms, which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time. We have all spoken favourably of this programme' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation, in addition to cross-border cooperation. However, this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80% - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for INTERREG IIIA. Therefore, we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand, regarding the selection of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory. We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament' s position in practical terms, and not just with a formal tribute. Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies. This discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature. This is in line with ongoing discrimination, which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies.	de
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves. Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster. Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved. Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport. This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport. But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission. As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem. I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. Transport of dangerous goods by road The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)]. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation. Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive. In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments. I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job. In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today. Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty. The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community. It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.	el
Yet the problem with this supposed antiracism is not its search for truth or even its support for migrants ... Mr Schulz, my family never accepted any German capo. This will not start with you! ... It is rather a question of nipping in the bud any vague desires which nations might have to oppose the destruction of their identity. The religion of antiracism has its dogmas, its priests, its inquisitors and its witch-hunts. History will roundly condemn the protagonists of this shameful ideology which we are proud to fight at any time. The English philosopher John Locke once said that a country without law is a country without freedom. Fifty years after the signing of the European Convention on Human Rights, twenty years after the Helsinki Final Act, ten years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and one year after the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, there are constitutional provisions remaining in the heart of Europe which belong to the medieval age - provisions which have no place in a modern Europe. For instance, Victor Emmanuel of Italy was forced to leave his native Italy as an uncomprehending nine-year old child, and for fifty-three years has been unable to return. If he sails from his home in Corsica in the direction of Italian territorial waters, coastguards are mobilised using modern satellite technology instructing him with loudspeakers to turn back. His twenty-eight-year-old son has only been to Italy once when his plane was diverted to Milan airport because of bad weather. The plane was surrounded by police guards and he was told not to step off the plane. What has he got to do with what his great-grandfather did during the Fascist era? 80% of Italians in a recent poll believe these people should be allowed to return without restrictions. Neither represent any conceivable threat to the Italian State. This is not, as some have tried to claim, an issue affecting only a few people; it goes to the heart of the European Union's commitment to respect the Convention on Human Rights, to its own Treaties and to the rule of law. There is much talk of a Charter of Fundamental Rights. Such talk will ring exceedingly hollow if this Parliament does not first do all it can to address existing Treaty violations. I speak as someone with a deep and abiding love for Italy and its people, but I say here to you today, and to President Ciampi of Italy, that Italy had neither the moral nor the legal right to sign the Treaty of Amsterdam until it had removed this most blatant violation of the Convention from its own constitution. This is also the case for Austria where Otto von Habsburg was required to deny his own identity and renounce rights belonging to him and to members of his family to enter Austria. The rights under the Treaty are not conditional in my view. The Treaty does not discriminate against individual families and the Treaty is therefore violated. The right to enter, live and die in your own country are fundamental, sacrosanct rights and I hope that this Parliament will uphold them. I therefore commend paragraphs 41 and 42 to this House. Mr President, respect for human rights is one of the European Union' s cornerstones. That is what it says in the Treaties and that is what we keep reminding each other of. It is therefore to be welcomed that every year, the European Parliament issues a report on respecting human rights within the European Union itself. Although I did not join the European Parliament until last year, I happen to know that the handling of this annual human rights report has, over the past couple of years, always met with a great deal of political commotion and confusion. The commotion is justified, given the nature of the topic, but the confusion is not. I am therefore particularly delighted that this year, a report has been produced which is very well balanced and to the point, except for one single industrial accident which Mr Schulz has already mentioned and with regard to which we are having to sit and witness some rather despicable displays at times. Fortunately, we can show our disagreement by drumming our fingers on our tables.	fi
Mr President, it has taken us twenty-five years to come to the point of a common position which represents a real compromise. I want to pay tribute to Mr Lannoye. He is a parliamentarian of considerable skill, and he has argued his case throughout with force and conviction. But he undervalues his own contribution to this debate, because it is what he has done and others have done that have led us to a position which can be fairly regarded as a compromise. Those who deny that and say that we are still in the position of total obstruction, are really admitting - as those are who wish in the vote tomorrow to reject the common position - that they do not want this directive at all. They do not want to see the addition of vegetable fats anywhere, in any Member State, in any form, for anything called chocolate. That is not a position which either the majority of the Member States or the majority of consumers in the European Union would accept for one minute, and I want to use my brief time to argue the contrary case. If we move on from harmonisation at nought-percent vegetable fat, which has always been in the campaigning argument, we move to a position where we ask for safeguards for consumers, for the primary producers, and essentially for the standards that we set ourselves in the European Union. The amendments that came before the Environment Committee, with the exception of the few that were passed, were wrecking amendments. They were designed to postpone, for the lifetime of this Parliament and the lifetime of this Commission, any resolution of this issue, and that is not acceptable. They called for impact studies to come into force before the directive itself can take effect or all manner of additional labelling over and beyond the double labelling on the packet which is provided here for the consumers. My Group supports the common position with some exceptions, and they will all make themselves heard in this debate. We believe that this is good for consumers. They get a wider choice of product and separate and distinctive labelling. It is good for the manufacturers of all the vegetable fats and I include cocoa butter in this. Cocoa butter is the predominant component of all forms of chocolate, as it will continue to be, also for those who have produced the natural vegetable fats, a specific list which can only be altered with the advice and consent of this Parliament. If I came from Burkina Faso or Mali or one of the countries that produced beurre de karit√© and I was told that the women' s cooperatives who collect the shea nuts that are a substantial part of their exports to Europe, will be banned or put at risk because they are seen to be stooges of the multinationals, I would be very angry indeed. The last point that I have time to make is to the producers of quality chocolate by the specialised methods we see in Belgium and some other areas.	el
The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people. The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission' s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly. It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified, where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two. The Erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address. This question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future. The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern, and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this, is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of Erika in future. Will it really address the concern or will, in practice, in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas, the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause. Mr President, our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster, but good intentions are not enough, there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment. We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation, and for this to be backdated. We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection, and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority, and also, in particular, of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory. We further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats. Finally, we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic, with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million. This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products. This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment. Finally, we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks, as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage. A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation. Solutions cannot be found at the last minute, when the disaster is already in progress. Consequently, the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand. Mr President, over two months after the wreck of the Erika, pollution of the coasts, which have already been cleaned once, is still continuing. While reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this, I should like to salute the dedication of the workers, professionals and volunteers, who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches. Thanks to the grass-roots involvement, which this House furthered by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 January, an initial raft of measures has been announced.	de
In this sense, thank you. Mr President, these reports are heading in the right direction but we cannot accept the self-satisfaction of the recitals in the current treaties. To be effective, the fight against discrimination requires broader and, in particular, more specific measures. Therefore, any restriction linked to nationality for access to civil service jobs must be abolished. The institutions of the Community and Member States must lead the way in this. In the same way, full citizenship implies giving third country nationals resident in the European Union the right to vote in all elections. As long as these third country nationals are refused political rights, they will be the target of demagogy and discrimination. If their status as taxpayers justifies their access to this right, why limit this to the local and European levels? Finally, in Europe the situation of all illegal immigrants must be legalised in order to fight against the traffic in labour and the xenophobic hatred which has recently been seen, in Spain, for example. This would mean breaking with the provisions of the Schengen, Amsterdam and Dublin Treaties which are real insults to the right of asylum. We believe that the fight against racism does not really require a legal arsenal, however good this may be, but rather specific measures to eliminate unemployment and exclusion. This is where we expect to see progress. Mr President, we can write all we like about human rights and we can report and discuss the issue, but unless we follow through on our intentions and the reports, they are meaningless. They gather dust on the shelves of the Commission and in the offices of well-meaning people and governments. We must show leadership as must the media, educational institutions and the churches; they have not shown such leadership in the past. Shame on us for ignoring Mozambique for so long and doing too little, too late. We are a continent that is sending USD 2 billion worth of weapons to drought-stricken Ethiopia and we cannot find a couple of helicopters to send urgently to save people drowning in Mozambique. It is a real shame on us and the other European institutions that we cannot respond to these kinds of disasters. Shame on us for allowing the children of Iraq to die at the rate of 5 000 a month. Half a million have died since the introduction of sanctions. There continues to be a barbarous war in Iraq. Bombing continues ruthlessly and unreported. It is a war against children and the innocent citizens of that country. We should intervene with the Security Council individually and collectively to ensure that medicines are delivered to the people. Shame on us for allowing the sale of arms and weapons to the Great Lakes region. Shame on us in the European Union for not stamping out racism and xenophobia which are endemic in my country and in the EU in general. Racism is a crime - a crime that is not pursued in the Union, an offence against a law that is not enforced in the Union.	el
Allow me to give you an example, since the speaking time allotted to me does not give me much opportunity to expand on this idea. Let us consider the intended reform of the infringement procedure. What is the intention there? It is simply to administrate the existing resources on each level, instead of hearing this Parliament' s demand that we should create a genuine administrative procedural law for ensuring legal certainty, which is necessary from the point of view of the European citizen, that is to say, from the point of view of the people who may have recourse to this infringement procedure. It is simply said that this administrative procedural law will not be created, but rather demands will be selected. How can this be? How can these things be selected in a purely arbitrary way. From the point of view of this Parliament, this type of arrangement cannot be allowed. We understand that the Commission has to be reformed. We agree with the objectives of this reform. However, it should not lead to the abandonment of the great momentum of European construction, for the sake of protecting the Community' s financial interests, however important we may all agree that that is. The Treaty obliges the Commission, primarily, to provide that momentum. Thank you, Mr Prodi, for your presentation and your documentation. Congratulations on using the Internet for the general public - a very good idea. I will start with trade. We agree with you that we need a rules-based trading system. It is essential. Seattle failed because the United States, in particular, appeared unable to grasp the legitimacy of policies such as environmental protection, the preservation of rural communities through the common agricultural policy, animal welfare, health concerns and social rights. It displayed incredible insensitivity to the legitimate concerns of the developing world and, frankly, the developing world has little so far to thank the WTO for. We expect the European Union to continue negotiations, maintaining our strong positions on all these issues and using our links with countries in the developing world to ensure that the next round is a fair round. Please, can we have detailed proposals in the next three months about how this will happen. Innovation and knowledge - very appropriate for a new century. How much innovation has taken place in the Commission, or indeed in the Parliament may I say? We had a White Paper on innovation some years ago - what has happened since? One thing I would like to say very strongly is that we are very concerned in follow-up, not simply in excellent communications, which we welcome, but in follow-up, follow-up, follow-up!!!! We have under way the Fifth Research Framework Programme - what has happened to what was learned in the Fourth? What is the dissemination for the new ideas, the new products, the new comparisons of socio-economic systems? Follow-up again, please. We welcome incidentally the formation of a European research area which you and Commissioner Busquin have put forward. This is an excellent way in which to begin the century. I welcome the forthcoming communication on enterprise, but I hope that past work will also be looked at before we go ahead with more.	el
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities. In conclusion, the document is not particularly satisfactory, and in some aspects is disappointing. Berend Report (A5-0107/1999) . (PT) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union. We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues. Firstly, and as the Commission itself states, it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German L√§nder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards. This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union' s per capita GDP level. We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area. This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes. Finally, but no less importantly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur' s proposal that, in future, this type of report should also include, amongst other issues, an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State. The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue. This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State. . (FR) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment, the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration. As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today. The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries. This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996. It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened. It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration. Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained. . (PT) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy, the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion. Issues of mergers and state aid however, still remain within the notification system.	fr
The rapporteur has adopted a perfectly good position in this issue, in the final analysis. Drivers of commercial vehicles run up thousands of kilometres every year, and the roadworthiness of the vehicles cannot be monitored adequately by means of mere annual inspections. Roadside spot checks are also necessary because heavy goods vehicles from non-member countries often enter the area of the Union in bad condition, presenting a serious risk to safety. The newly reviewed directive will do a lot to improve road safety if its provisions are complied with properly and penalties can be imposed for breaches, penalties that are effective, along the right lines and which will serve as a warning. The directive will be more efficacious if the Member States can negotiate a harmonised system of penalties. This should not, however, slow down the prompt implementation of the directive. Justification for the prompt reform of the directive is provided by something that happened recently in Finland. The police and the vehicle inspection authorities were conducting a spot check of sixty-two heavy goods vehicles in eastern Finland recently. The drivers of thirty-three of them received fines, and sixteen received a warning. Three vehicles were prohibited from continuing their journey. Only thirteen were in fully acceptable condition. A considerable number of the vehicles in bad condition were from non-member countries. The worst case was a Polish truck with no brakes in the drawing vehicle, a poorly secured load, and a trailer whose brakes were badly leaking. Everyone can imagine what sort of safety hazard such a lorry would be on roads covered in snow and ice. Our group supports Amendment No 3 and hopes the new version of the directive will come into force promptly. Mr President, Commissioners, many complimentary phrases have been used to describe this directive and I would like to thank Mr Piecyk, but because some developments are of an interim nature, I would like to add a few comments. After the directive was discussed in the Commission, I recently asked the Commissioner about non-EU drivers driving within the EU and making use of the way people, drivers, in particular, are inspected during the technical inspections of cars. What is happening in effect is the following: drivers who do not have an employment permit in an EU Member State and who do not have a work contract in the third country benefit from the situation in that they drive a car which is registered in a particular country and which subsequently passes all inspections without a hitch, but do so outside the country where they are registered and where they carry out their activities. It is precisely in those countries that employment permits and work contracts are not checked up on. In other words, I would like to argue against directly including this option in the directive, but I would at any rate recommend further exploration of this option as a secondary matter in order to find a solution to this problem. Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, safety on our roads is of great concern to us all.	el
That is my first question. My second question is about the Employment Summit. I firmly believed, particularly because I attended the discussions on including the employment problem on the Council agenda, and on the European Union agenda, that the original idea of the Employment Summit was to combat the problems, not of the new knowledge-based economy, but of the old European economy, the problems of unemployment in factories, dockyards, iron and steelworks, and that these were the employment problems which were originally due to be on the Employment Summit agenda. It is therefore perfectly reasonable to raise the question of whether, when we talk about the problems of the new knowledge-based economy and of the new digital economy, which, as far as I know have created unemployment rather than employment in Europe, we are not replacing an inability to deal with the problems of unemployment in the present by what has largely been - and still is today - empty rhetoric about the problems of employment in the future... No one understands better than us the crucial role that the Internet, the digital economy and the knowledge-based economy have to play, but these issues were not what the Employment Summit was originally intended for. Mr President-in-Office, you concluded on a vaguely ideological note, which is fair enough. If this is the Social Democrats' policy for the economy of the future, then I would like to remind you that one of the most serious problems of the Internet economy and Europe' s lagging behind is the lack of entrepreneurial spirit in the education system, in the behaviour of governments and in the way the institutions function. This is what we must counter if we are to guarantee the knowledge-based economy of the future. Mr President-in-Office, first of all, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament, particularly as your presence here symbolises what the Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists has already referred to. By that I mean the political symbolism of the fact that during your tour of the capitals, you have also come to listen to the European Parliament. This is not the first time during the Portuguese Presidency that there has been a different and politically stimulating relationship between the Council and Parliament, but this is a significant gesture which, as my friend and colleague Mr Bar√≥n Crespo noted, we were delighted to note. Our position is clear: we support the Portuguese Government' s initiative. We support it because it is a serious initiative and because of its substance, both in terms of strategic objectives and in terms of other objectives with which we agree. Furthermore, the way in which this European Council is being prepared is a good illustration of this. Firstly, there is the seriousness and depth of the document presented in January. Then, there are the various preparatory conferences and the contributions that both business and union leaders are making towards this summit. In particular, there is the latest contribution to research that was made at the recent meeting which brought together Nobel Prize winners and Ministers for Science and Technology. This shows that the Portuguese Government is preparing for this Summit seriously and is paying a great deal of attention to its substance.	el
How do we implement what the Treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes? One or two honourable Members, Mr Ferber and Mr Cushnahan, spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality. Mr Cashman said, which is right in a sense, that words are no substitute for real action. Of course, words can make a bit of a difference, a point that was made by Mrs Malmstr√∂m. She said that she had received a letter from the Chinese Ambassador, a very amiable and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country, to tell her that she was wrong and the European Parliament was wrong in its attitude on human rights in China. I think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letters from the Chinese authorities. She will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in China. I think she was reflecting the views of many non-governmental organisations, many people who admire Chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in China today.  Of course it is entirely right that we have to look at action, and the very first speech by Mr Salafranca mentioned two issues apart from Geneva which represent actions, one of which is of course made possible by the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of the European taxpayer - that is the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - about EUR 100 million that is spent through programmes, for which I am responsible, mainly going to non-governmental organisations to promote human rights and to promote democratisation. We will want to share with Parliament, as vicars say, our views on how that spending programme to support human rights can be best focused and best targeted in the years ahead. There is also the question which was referred to by Mr Salafranca, who I am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate. There is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy. I want to remind Parliament that the Commission will be publishing, before the middle of the year, a comprehensive, intellectual case for placing human rights at the heart of the development of the common foreign and security policy. It is immensely important, and if I had not thought that already, having listened to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion. It has been a useful debate. I hope we can have further debates like this. I hope we can have, in particular, debates about some of the ways in which we translate these good intentions into practice on the ground where it matters, where people are still being tortured, where people are still being raped and are still being denied the sort of civil rights that this House takes for granted, as I do. I have received 7 motions for resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2), to close the present statement. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday. Cyprus and Malta The next item is the joint debate on:	de
Mr Schulz should be aware of this. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully understand the frustration of Mr Di Pietro who, in a short space of time, has had to carry out an extraordinary amount of work in order to be able to submit this report to us today. Crime in the European Union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step-by-step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs. The European Parliament is certainly not to blame for this. It is the governments of the Member States who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree. As a result, the European Parliament is faced with an almost impossible task. One has to content oneself with the idea that all means, however slight, must be seized upon in order to set up better legal assistance. By way of paradox, I could say that it would be best if as little as possible was said about this report, for the clearer we make it that only very small steps are being taken, the more the world of crime will gloat and the more the acute imbalance between organised crime and the desperate lack of judicial cooperation will become obvious. I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council of Ministers to finally face reality, that is to say the fact that crime is developing faster than the law. The goal is, after all, to provide the judicial bodies - magistrates, in the first place, but also the citizens involved - with the instruments to fight crime without prejudice to the fundamental guarantees of defence and the general principles of human rights. If not, we will be fighting a running battle. I therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the EU Member States in the first instance. In my opinion, this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States. As long as this harmonisation has not been achieved, however, we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance. To this end, I had submitted an amendment stipulating that legal assistance can only be granted in the event of criminal prosecution instituted by the authorities based on facts which are punishable according to the national law of the petitioning party and the Member State petitioned. The content of my amendment is, in fact, echoed in Amendment No 43, which also stipulates this condition of accrual. This condition of accrual is essential since, in my opinion, the principle of nulla poena sine lege, legality in criminal law, must be observed. As such, any request for legal assistance concerning a hypothetical action which is not a crime in the petitioned Member State contravenes this principle of legality and thus the fundamental principles of justice in the petitioned Member State. Hence, it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted. Finally, I would like to reiterate that Mr Di Pietro has, in my opinion, delivered sterling work by submitting a report which, within the limitations, offers all possible guarantees for safeguarding individual human rights and fundamental freedoms. If, however, we would like to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation. Mr President, my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs. The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government. The present proposal is complex, because it deals with agreements between Member States but has far-reaching consequences for the citizen-government relationship. It is precisely in the field of legal protection that the Council' s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired. In the words of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro, the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings. Thanks to the agreement, it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests, whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different Member States. The chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court. Additional measures are hence required, such as the obligation on the part of criminal investigators to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used.	fi
After all, we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance, that is to say, we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future. How, though, is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now, i.e. before enlargement takes place? That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference. We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future. My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs. You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand. What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and, in particular, a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs, because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns, the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians. The politics of closed doors and private discussions; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all. That is why we need transparency. I believe it falls to you, as President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before, leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties. We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going, and its outcome, rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent. We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future. In this way, Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy. There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to. As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I wish to make the following point clear: neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter. After all, what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals? No, to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union. The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone. What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union. Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year. Of course, we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States.	de
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress. The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council' s very meagre opening offer. In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount. We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under. This was an important consideration for us. I would like to say however that it is, and has always been, a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real. Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States. We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme. If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level, this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action, including Community actions, on energy saving. Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region. We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard. SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy. It focuses on non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted. Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings. We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business, saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical. It is something that we can all support. I have to say, like motherhood, although we all support it, sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving. We could do rather more, considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports. We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see. We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change. If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do. I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal, since she has contributed, in collaboration with the other Members, to the achievement of a very reasonable final result, which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and, of course, on what, from a budgetary point of view, the Council had initially accepted. As Mrs Ahern has explained very well, the budgets of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme, are basically symbolic budgets, since the burden is shouldered by the countries, the States of the Union, the regions or even, in some cases, the local authorities. However, despite the fact that the volume is relatively small, it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action, which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments. This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources, greater safety in our energy supplies and, in the case of SAVE, to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy, thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set. Furthermore, behind these programmes, that is to say, the SAVE programme, which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings, and the Altener programme, which concerns renewable energy, there lies an extremely important technological challenge, which, from an economic point of view, may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole. With regard to the parliamentary procedure, I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken, especially the rapporteur, because the majority of Parliament' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council, in this case practically all of them, although with some modifications. I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved.	fi
"If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual. What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region, or in a 5b region? What answer will the Commission give, when it is on the scene, when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building, and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc.? All this is well-intentioned advice. However, I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage. The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree. What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid, so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date. Mr President, Commissioner, permit me, first of all, to make reference to two facts. Firstly, at the beginning of 1999, NATO, with the participation of most Member States of the European Union, flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom. We are now endeavouring, at huge cost, to get the country back on its feet again and help its people, and rightly so. Secondly, at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU. The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders. ""We do not have the wherewithal for that,"" they said. This is wrong! And no one can comprehend this attitude. Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss. The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity, also from within this Community. I say they have a right to solidarity. Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need. I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms. It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority. I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will. Permit me one further comment. Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm, the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter. The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency. We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations. We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment. Then, for example, people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart. When, in 1994, over five years ago that is, I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament, I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier. To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work. It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again! Mr President, Commissioner, the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems. It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters. There have always been natural disasters and there always will be. Of course, there is a need for solidarity here. There is certainly a need for European civil protection, and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters. But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes."	fi
The European Union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role, but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were, as you have said yourself, Mrs Karamanou, not the best before the military action in Kosovo. What is more, I do not believe, Mrs Karamanou, that the military action in Kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation. The present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations, and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in Kosovo' s administration. This is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole. And if we cannot solve the political problem, which must be done in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolution, then we will not solve the problem of child health, nor the various other problems faced by this region. I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica. In cooperation with Europe, the international community rebuilt the hospital there too, but it is located in the northern part of the city, thus prohibiting access to Albanian Kosovars. This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars. This is also happening elsewhere in the country, causing tension between the Albanian Kosovars and Serbs, making for a situation where nobody trusts anybody anymore and where Albanians do not want to be looked after by Serbs and vice versa. I understand very well what you are saying and you are right: the European Union should work in a wider context of international cooperation. But where will you place the emphasis? What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital, including that in Mitrovica? Mr Staes, the situation in Mitrovica is well known. This is a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of Kosovo. I perfectly understand Mr Staes' s concerns. Nevertheless, I would like to say that Bernard Kouchner' s work in this area has aimed to comply with the objectives of the relevant United Nations resolution, in an attempt to create multi-ethnic facilities which can serve the various communities, including the various aspects of the administration. I believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible, because there are various protagonists involved. The situation in Mitrovica is appalling, and involves very special tensions, and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed. Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals.	de
But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps. We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility, the excessive mandatory levies. But let us not forget that there is another one, a new handicap, with the single currency. In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances. This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission' s report. But, in reality, we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation. If you add the strangeness of a single currency that is not built upon a State, itself based upon a people, you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the markets' suspicion of the euro. Indeed, it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999, as it favoured growth in an unexpected way, but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is, in fact, symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions. Mr President, the present draft resolution is controversial. Given the topic it covers, this is hardly surprising. It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned. The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment, but it is, in fact, a short-term policy. Even if he advocates sustainable growth, sustainability does not come into it. Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy. More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity. The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes. If Member States do not do anything about this, there will be even fewer means for care, education and other important public amenities in the future. An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd. It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which, at 2%, is now at its maximum permitted level. If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again. What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular. High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting. Promoting employment, however, is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy. Member States, in particular, should adopt an effective policy. In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway. Rigidity by imposing social convergence criteria and other Community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs.	de
And since this is St. Valentine' s day, as a former Mayor of a regional city, I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love. Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles: preservation of jobs, stewardship of the countryside and, not least, local culture, because that is of the utmost importance. Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured. We can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the Alps and they are devastating. But I warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside. And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore. To really guarantee sustainability - a buzzword which has, since it gained new currency, become relatively devoid of meaning, but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed, amongst other things, is an integrated approach in the countryside towards, for example, tourism and agriculture. The investment needs to be visionary. Young, creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside. If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more. None of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate, all-round distribution, and the pilot projects need to act, as it were, like avalanches and trigger other similar projects. I would be in favour of supporting self-contained cycles of projects and, even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have had shortcomings here and there, overall they were certainly positive. I should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountainous areas - the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada, from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density. Mr President, I want to talk about the EQUAL report, especially the issue of the policy on refugees. Last week, we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government. Today, we are already discussing the Austrian coalition government' s policy on refugees because Mrs Stenzel, who is the author of the EQUAL report, of course represents Austria' s governing conservative party and its policy. The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention, that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees. In actual fact, it is the other refugees, namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid, who need aid the most. The Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the EQUAL programme on identical conditions. Some members of the Committee, however, supported Mrs Stenzel' s proposal and wordings. As I see it, this means that Mr Haider' s politics are already casting their shadow over this Parliament.	fr
This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March. It was erroneously included in today' s agenda. Mr Swoboda, I can confirm what you have just said and there is, in fact, a printing error. The document that has been distributed contains inaccuracies, because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate. Mr President, I just want to say that, as I was walking in this morning, I noticed two people smoking outside the Hemicycle. The smell is absolutely disgusting! Can you please do something about it? I cannot do anything about it myself, but you are quite right. We need a quick way of educating people, including those who do not obey the rules decided upon in this House. Regarding the problems caused by air travel delays, perhaps everybody who has had difficulty reaching Strasbourg for the present part-session should form a small group - although I am not sure that it will be small - to discuss the precise nature of the problems encountered. Coherence of EU policies with development The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of EU policies with development.  Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency, particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament is bound to play in the near future, given the need to strengthen development policies at European Union level. The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today, is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy. I shall, of course, give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making. I would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel, at EU level, to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years, which has benefited people in all walks of life, throughout the world, in terms of well-being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that, at the same time, there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world. This endangers the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace. We are all therefore duty-bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet. The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets. A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged, which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments, which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies. We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas:	de
The English philosopher John Locke once said that a country without law is a country without freedom. Fifty years after the signing of the European Convention on Human Rights, twenty years after the Helsinki Final Act, ten years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and one year after the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, there are constitutional provisions remaining in the heart of Europe which belong to the medieval age - provisions which have no place in a modern Europe. For instance, Victor Emmanuel of Italy was forced to leave his native Italy as an uncomprehending nine-year old child, and for fifty-three years has been unable to return. If he sails from his home in Corsica in the direction of Italian territorial waters, coastguards are mobilised using modern satellite technology instructing him with loudspeakers to turn back. His twenty-eight-year-old son has only been to Italy once when his plane was diverted to Milan airport because of bad weather. The plane was surrounded by police guards and he was told not to step off the plane. What has he got to do with what his great-grandfather did during the Fascist era? 80% of Italians in a recent poll believe these people should be allowed to return without restrictions. Neither represent any conceivable threat to the Italian State. This is not, as some have tried to claim, an issue affecting only a few people; it goes to the heart of the European Union's commitment to respect the Convention on Human Rights, to its own Treaties and to the rule of law. There is much talk of a Charter of Fundamental Rights. Such talk will ring exceedingly hollow if this Parliament does not first do all it can to address existing Treaty violations. I speak as someone with a deep and abiding love for Italy and its people, but I say here to you today, and to President Ciampi of Italy, that Italy had neither the moral nor the legal right to sign the Treaty of Amsterdam until it had removed this most blatant violation of the Convention from its own constitution. This is also the case for Austria where Otto von Habsburg was required to deny his own identity and renounce rights belonging to him and to members of his family to enter Austria. The rights under the Treaty are not conditional in my view. The Treaty does not discriminate against individual families and the Treaty is therefore violated. The right to enter, live and die in your own country are fundamental, sacrosanct rights and I hope that this Parliament will uphold them. I therefore commend paragraphs 41 and 42 to this House. Mr President, respect for human rights is one of the European Union' s cornerstones. That is what it says in the Treaties and that is what we keep reminding each other of. It is therefore to be welcomed that every year, the European Parliament issues a report on respecting human rights within the European Union itself.	el
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view. Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times. This time, however, it is true. We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement. The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not. Will we enlarge with or without deep reform? That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method. It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place. That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand. The Council must realise that, if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further. The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion. We want an Intergovernmental Conference, but not this one. Must there be an IGC? Of course there must, but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference. The agenda must go much further. We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic. Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes, more - its ability to take the initiative. We must clearly set firm objectives. The functionalist approach is over, for better or for worse. The functionalist approach has brought us to this point. Have we achieved results? Yes, but the point is to make a qualitative leap and, speaking in political terms, this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency. As far as we are concerned, after producing the opinion expected from the Commission, according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated.	el
I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition. That concept I reject firmly, because competition is there for the citizens, and for them alone. Most companies hate competition. Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens, their economic interest and for their liberty. The examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in telephony services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this. I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday, in the appropriate committee, more competently and in much more detail. Thank you very much, Commissioner. Pursuant to Rule 42(5), I have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate. The debate is closed. We shall now proceed to the vote. (Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE We voted in favour of the resolution because we received a request to this effect from a French postal service trade union which was looking to obtain, in the event of a favourable vote, an additional time frame in which to defend employees. This does not mean that we approve the entire contents, which are too vague and which leave out the main concern. The policy undertaken by the European institutions and by national governments, especially the French government, is a retrograde policy, counter to the interests of both the service users, i.e. the great majority of the population, and the postal service workers. Postal services must continue to be public services. All people, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions. In organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability, and private firms must not be authorised to amass private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities. Consequently, the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of Europe must keep their monopoly of this service. In order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the European Union level, it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices, reducing the number of deliveries and overworking postal staff. The post office and, more generally, all public services must, on the other hand, recruit additional staff. Such jobs are unquestionably useful, and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe. Mr President, personally I voted in favour of this resolution, because the essential thing is that the European Parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation. If we dismantle the public service, this would be very serious, and we wish to know what are the Commission' s intentions. Saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate. People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so. Postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service. Occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day. We can salute them, these postmen who, whatever the weather, sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone. Dismantling the postal service, the local communication service, would be a serious mistake and we would be unable to maintain the principle of the equality of all citizens. Profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion. Mr President, I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives. Several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman, particularly in mountain communities. I wholeheartedly agree. However, it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints. In my own country, Italy, there are some 200 000 postal workers who cost the state approximately ITL 50 million a year per capita, or EUR 25 000, that is, a total cost of around EUR 5 million.	fi
"We would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonians. This model function also applies to regional cooperation. I could not agree more with the rapporteur: a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece, and not cutting them off on the other. Mr President, Commissioner, if we manage this first step successfully, we will have gained a great deal. If we mess it up, then we will have lost a great deal more. Mr President, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle. I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support. I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia. Do not misunderstand me: I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime. But firstly, these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too, including Macedonia, which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is. Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive. So I believe that we should take today' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10. Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe. This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region. The European Union' s contribution under the Stability Pact, now converted into what is called the ""stabilisation and association process"" , represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, and it should therefore contribute to regional stability. So establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis, and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process, constitutes an important contribution to stability in the Balkans."	fr
"We must give them all our support to reach that goal. Human rights is such an important issue within the ACP-EU Assembly that Joint Vice-Presidents have been appointed with special responsibilities for monitoring human rights closely and reporting to the Assembly. A number of cases have been highlighted, including the child soldier issue in Sudan, where many children have been abducted from neighbouring states. I had the honour of being elected the European Co-President at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President. I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly, particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May. We must have more equality between our ACP partners and our European members and I want to get rid of the ""them and us"" syndrome. Firstly, I would like to see a Joint Parliamentary Assembly of elected members from ACP countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates. This I think is the new Convention. Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work. These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly. We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive. We are going to have one in Abuja in West Africa too. I want the Assembly to stop being just a talk-shop and become a work-shop for the betterment of all the people in developing countries. I want to see civil society given a louder voice. But to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on. We must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance. Equally, we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand. I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe. European taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used. A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to. The Joint Assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance, human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission. I believe that as equal partners the EU- and ACP-elected delegates are up to that task. I beg to move acceptance of this report. Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report. Our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty. But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU. With regard to financing, we must look to the future and provide the Joint Assembly with additional funds so that, for instance, we can send delegations to the ACP states to oversee electoral processes, at their invitation. In future, the EU must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and, furthermore, must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively."	de
Needless to say, this is a more effective monitoring method than the random measurement method used twice a year. According to experts, the costs are not higher since the measurement of cumulative samples is far cheaper. As such, the cost of the equipment for continuous sampling is recouped within the space of a few years. At first reading, considerable improvements were made to the Commission proposal thanks to a great deal of support. It was at that stage that expectations were raised amongst the citizens. I strongly urge MEPs to meet these expectations. A consistent approach taken by the European Parliament will benefit our credibility amongst the citizens, especially those citizens living in the vicinity of plants which incinerate or co-incinerate waste. Mr President, Commissioner, we feel that this directive is far from satisfactory because it involves a combination of two texts, one on the incineration of dangerous waste and the other on the incineration of non-dangerous waste. This raises problems for us at several phases of the incineration process: the reception, processing and handling of the waste. One might well ask what was the point of combining these two matters. We can find the answer in Mr Blokland' s report, which is violently opposed to the coincineration industry. Paradoxically, however, by the same token, the rapporteur is in favour of mixing dangerous and non-dangerous waste. What is the advantage of this for the environment? Our Group has no wish to favour either type of industry, since both are extremely useful to waste management in Europe. The practices of each Member State must be taken into consideration, while maintaining the existing industrial balance and investigating how the environment can be better protected. This is what the common position proposes. Priority must be given to the emission limits for the most harmful substances, i.e. NOx, dioxins and furanes. Moreover, the common position suggests an NOx limit value for the incineration of dangerous waste for the year 2007. Such a thing does not yet currently exist. As regards dioxins and furanes, the limit values have now been made mandatory for all types of waste. Until now, they applied only to non-dangerous waste. It is therefore unfortunate that the Blokland report is putting unrealistic solutions forward when it is known that a good many directives on waste management are not yet applied or are not properly applied by Member States. If one wishes to go too far, one becomes counter-productive. It is completely unrealistic to wish to review the limit values of this directive every three years, if one considers the considerable investment that the industry would have to make. What the industry needs is legal certainty and reasonable time periods. The real problem is that in Europe we do not have a proper definition of what waste is, resulting in ongoing confusion when we have to revise a text on waste or to present new proposals. Commissioner, waste management in Europe must undergo complete reform as a matter of urgency. Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Blokland on this report. We know that waste incineration is a very difficult and highly technical area, but I think that a creditable piece of work has been done in connection with this report. Unlike Mrs Grosset√™te, I think that the common position and Mr Blokland' s report will, as a matter of fact, make a significant environmental contribution in connection with waste incineration, whether we are talking about hazardous or non-hazardous waste. I believe that we are, in this way, obtaining a good tool for preventing and limiting environmental damage in connection with waste incineration and for preventing and limiting the associated risks to human health. Moreover, there are also some good resources which are being put to use. I shall certainly support the demand that proper waste planning be carried out, with waste being duly sorted, so that we have a situation in which waste incineration is linked to the EU' s combined waste legislation, with the incineration problem correctly placed in the waste hierarchy. I also think it is good that we should now be told very precisely which plants are covered by these rules and also which types of waste are thus exempt from them. Regarding the very difficult question of defining coincineration plant, including cement factories - in connection with the handling of which there has been some quite aggressive lobbying - I want to say that I think we can support Amendment No 43, which I think defines the common position well.	fi
It is true that economic aid is, in this respect, certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level. Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we, the Members of the European Parliament, must fulfil our own obligations in this regard, while ensuring, of course, that we are not the only ones to do so. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for his report. If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on. The Council' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret. The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should, and must, provide help swiftly, however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random. I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point, which clearly emphasises that it is only possible, and permissible, to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public, communal and other authorities and institutions, which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK. Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations, in particular Pillar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place. What is to be done with this money? I would like to highlight the issue of human rights. The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today? We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit. Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians. I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life. These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated. I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo. There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again. It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo. It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo. What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together. We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough. We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights.	el
I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem. Mr President, I want to thank you for your answer. I want to ask a follow-up question which bears some resemblance to the one Mr Sj√∂stedt asked. We both come from Sweden. In our country, we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local. We have extensive services, too. We have problems stemming from the lack of confidence in politicians and, not least, in European politicians here in Parliament. How do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education, health care etc - but, at the same time, did not pay any tax and did not contribute? How do you think a system like that would affect people' s confidence in ourselves as politicians? Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question. However, if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy, go ahead! . Mr President, I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy. These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society. I do not want to enter into this type of discussion because I think that it might, to use a French expression, pr√©juger the Portuguese Presidency' s views in the course of the negotiations in which it is involved on the Statute for Members. I would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter. Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing. That concludes Questions to the Council. (The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.) Address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic Mr President, allow me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to extend our warmest thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation. Thank you. You are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a European identity. And you have used your personal experience to show us that your European identity was not decreed; it was a spontaneous and natural move. I have taken note of your words; this is something which we all feel very deeply. We find you faithful to the principles which have always guided you, which have always guided your actions; your attachment to fundamental values. You reminded us of your speech in 1994, which you yourself qualify as slightly provocative, but there is such a thing as creative utopia and we have been able to gauge together how far we have come. And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need.	el
I believe that the Commission' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function, but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter. For our part, we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area. It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sj√∂stedt and others have asked. We have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens, decision makers and authorities. We are very anxious indeed that the EU, too, should move in this direction, and this is also stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam. One or two years ago, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs L√∂√∂w which is extremely important in this context. The report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States. We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament. I want to ask the Council if it understands this warning, in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the Commission. I listened very carefully to what Mr Seixas da Costa had to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference. My concern is, if I have understood Mr Seixas da Costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the IGC, whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widening the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference. After all, examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobbies. It should have its own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference, which would mean widening the agenda. Mr Dimitrakopoulos, transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions. This Intergovernmental Conference will, at the outset, concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate, particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic, more transparent and more efficient. All of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims. It is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the European agenda and it will, of course, feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference. I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference. It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament, who will surely rally behind this proposal. We will then see, at ministerial level, how we can follow this up. It should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the Treaty of Amsterdam, which was approved last May, and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress. The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency. My feeling is that, in spite of everything, this issue will always have to be on the agenda, because the public is clearly concerned about it, and because it is linked with the need to make the European institutions accountable to the public.	de
It ought to make the programme more attractive to manufacturers, distributors and consumers. In particular, the proposal accords greater responsibility to the bodies responsible for eco-labelling and to various interest groups when it comes to establishing ecological criteria. The Commission considers that these objectives will be fulfilled thanks to cooperation with, and interest on the part of, the European Parliament and the Council. I believe that the relationship between the Community' s eco-labelling programme and the national eco-labelling programmes is better and more clearly defined in the current proposal. The proposal also reinforces the interested parties' role and participation. This applies, in particular, to various interest groups and to the environmental bodies dedicated to eco-labelling. Their participation is crucial if the present voluntary instrument is to be favoured and made more widely available in the correct way. It is one of the few European instruments which will, in fact, be able to play a key role in supporting sustainable consumption. With regard to the amendments tabled by the European Parliament, the Commission considers that these have helped improve the exposition of the regulation. With regard to Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 8, which propose active participation on the part of environmental and consumer organisations, the Commission shares the view that their support and participation is crucial if eco-labelling is to be balanced and credible. We are therefore able to accept these amendments. With regard to Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 7, which relate to certain aspects of cooperation and coordination with national eco-labelling programmes, the Commission is convinced that common supporting activities are important, particularly with a view to making the Community' s eco-labelling better known. We are therefore able to approve these amendments, too. Amendment No 5 proposes four ways of making the fee structure more flexible and easier for those who apply to be accepted. The Commission supports this overarching objective. After all, eco-labelling is, of course, voluntary, and the fees ought not to be so high that those who make the most effort in the interests of the environment are prevented from applying for the eco-label. Amendment No 6 concerns fee reductions for small and medium-sized companies, as well as developing countries, and emphasises that these should be appreciable. The Commission is able to support this amendment, too. To summarise, the Commission is therefore able to approve all the amendments. Mr President, I wanted earlier on, as I concluded my previous speech, to make a point of order to which I should like to alert the President and the Bureau. Before the vote tomorrow, it needs to be made clear that certain amendments to the present report have not been translated. They are only to be found in English. This applies, for example, to Amendments 7 and 8. These are only available in English, which is totally unacceptable. If we are to be able to vote on this report, these amendments need at least to be read out before they are voted on. That was the first point. The second concerns, for example, the work programme for environmental strategy... (The President cut the speaker off) Thank you very much for pointing out the position regarding amendments. The services are looking at this and I hope that they will be ready in time for tomorrow. We cannot allow the debate to continue because we are running out of time. Thank you, Commissioner, for your contribution. That concludes the debate. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. Incineration of waste The next item is the recommendation for a second reading on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the incineration of waste (C5-0274/1999 - 1998/0289(COD)). On Amendments Nos 36 and 37, which have been distributed, I am shown as the joint mover of the motion. I discovered this yesterday evening and notified DG1 of the fact this morning. DG1 acknowledged that a mistake had been made by the translation service. I then asked for this to be corrected. DG1 refused, saying that they did not have the time. I should like to say that I think this is completely unacceptable. They have had more than 12 hours in which to correct the amendments concerned. I feel very put out that these have been made publicly available with wrong information about who the movers of the motion are. It is a question, then, of Amendments Nos 36 and 37, of which I am not the joint mover of the motion.	fi
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development. The beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month. I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again. The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process, as all sides - Palestinians, Israelis, their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged. Nor is our role confined to that of banker. We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region. But we should not kid ourselves: a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag. The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments. We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon. But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process. We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians. We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them. The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza. European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period. In this context, let me applaud the important steps that the Palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency. President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week. This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law. The Commission is actively involved in those efforts. The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs. We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year. This package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels. Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East. A number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of Community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them, helping to consolidate a Golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the Golan Heights. Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy. Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon, the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict, will also demand considerable efforts.	de
"Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too. It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve. If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics. Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people' s social welfare and boost purchasing power. To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply. Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today. I would like to quote verbatim from the report: ""State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland. Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."" I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures. I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation. I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus. This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe. Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper. I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000. I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace. No other Member State is at such a disadvantage. Mr President, the monopolies' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe. The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies' ban to be unsatisfactory, something I would wholeheartedly agree with. But opinion differs as to the solution. The Commission' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation. In other words, we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse. Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system. I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law. We would be changing the law to make it executable again, which is something I consider to be unacceptable."	fr
I shall give you the floor for any points of order after the vote. Report (A5-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta (COM(1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)) Relating to Amendments Nos 22 and 24 Madam President, I want to condemn the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. On Third Pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice, it is unacceptable for the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to be absent. I also want to mention the translation problems, of which I will give just one example, as we do not have much time. Correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts. Amendment No 83 in Italian, which is the original version, states that 'il minore deve essere assistito da una persona di sua fiducia o da un perito o legale esterno' . The term 'legale esterno' has been translated into French as 'avocat neutre' . I have no idea what an 'avocat neutre' is. It rather seems like a contradiction in terms. However, in the Spanish version the 'abogado' has disappeared completely. Madam President, you have said several times that this is a very serious problem. The lawyer-linguists should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version is produced. Quite, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this is not the first time and it is indeed most worrying. We shall address this problem and check all the translations. Madam President, I simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote started, to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar. I should like you, Madam President, to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future. Quite, I am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and I shall be most happy to pass this on. Relating to Amendment No 31 Madam President, in the phrase which reads 'Where consent to the transfer is required from the person concerned' , the words 'under the national law of the requesting or requested Member State' should be added after 'Where' . (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)  Madam President, in the heat of the moment I forgot to mention that, in my report on the excessive deficit procedure, the last paragraph of the explanatory statement contains a mistake in the Spanish version. An 's' has been omitted and instead of reading 'la propuesta nos parece correcta' , it reads 'la propuesta no parece correcta' which is completely the contrary. I just wanted to correct this. Proposal for a resolution (B5-0132/2000) by Mrs Bonino and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the Commission communication on the strategic objectives for the next five years	de
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.) Resumption of the sitting The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments? (The Minutes were approved)  Mr President, I should like make a comment in connection with a meeting held last night by various Members of Parliament from all groups. The purpose of the meeting, which was attended by several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, together with the architects who designed this building, was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions. We discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you, Mr President, in fact conceals a huge window which, if the curtain were drawn back, would afford a wonderful view over the river. We were told that the curtain was closed so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the lighting during debates. But what is to prevent us, before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting, opening the curtains and enjoying the apparently magnificent view behind you? I am more than happy for our House to be illuminated by the brilliance of our debates but a little real sunlight on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss. I think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the ushers. Thank you very much Mr Onesta, I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort. I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being. In the meantime, I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter, technically speaking. If so, then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the President sits with his back to the light! UCITS . (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my hope that Parliament is prepared now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in Europe. As a new Member of the European Parliament, it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter. I should especially like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their willingness to find compromises; the President and the Bureau for lending a sensitive ear to this complex issue; the Commission, and especially the Commissioner, for being such worthwhile contacts; the Council; and also the division responsible for servicing the committee, for its selfless work. There was a good deal of agreement within the committee, apart from on a matter which, too, I hope it will be possible to solve. The issue of UCITS may appear difficult, technical and a political minefield. I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stands for. Allow me, however, to state very clearly that this is a question which really does affect the citizens of Europe in so far as it relates to how their savings are administered, what options there are available, how competition operates between countries in regard to different forms of savings, savers' demand for security, and the opportunities Europe' s citizens have to save wisely for their old age.	de
Having said that, governing means planning. It also means being responsible and, in this new context which has been forced upon us, competition law naturally has an essential role to play. In this area, the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action: acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices, by refocusing its departments' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest Community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law. As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints. Finally, on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction. The Commission is, in fact, retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities, but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all. National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control. In conclusion, I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction, we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which, if it were realised, would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states. Mr President, Commissioner, we have a basically positive view of the Commission' s White Paper on competition, particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation, but we are also puzzled by several things. First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes. In this respect, we should heed the words of von Eieck, and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni, who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies. State interference in the economy is, even today, still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market, competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers. There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann.	fr
We should counter such acts of terror, Mr President, by setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in preventing other conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere. My fellow Member, Mrs Roure, was right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order. Finally, and I think this is important: why not have the honesty today to relay what was disclosed in a recent UN study explaining that, if Spain wishes to preserve its work, retirement and pension potential, it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year 2050? We must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember, to recall the dates in history when our countries teetered on the brink of horror. We need to educate our children on these matters and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepared to accept many more immigrants in years to come. It just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday. We must take to the streets of Europe to protest against these alliances with extremists which are a disgrace to Europe and which lead our youth astray. Mr President, since the signature of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has had responsibility for combating racism and xenophobia. Two types of measure are required for this purpose. The first should seek the integration of people of non-European origin and the other should aim to organise immigration. With regard to the first, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and an action plan, which aim to apply the following decision taken by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere. This states that 'The European Union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its Member States. A more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens' . This is totally contrary to what we have seen and found recently in El Ejido where there are irregularities, labour exploitation and indecent living conditions, which have been condemned in the past. I hope for prompt implementation of the measures to achieve integration. I also hope that the governments which produced such wonderful words in Tampere, including Spain, will work diligently to apply these. I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement made by the Council on immigration. The only proposal which has been made is for the directive on family reunification. This is a key issue, as we have seen recently in the media that there are many men on their own in El Ejido. Yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments. Outside the Community arena, some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies. This is occurring in my country, despite the government, the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens. The objective of combating racism and xenophobia, explained in the Treaties, should be the objective of all European institutions and politicians. On 28 February 1998 the European political parties, including the Spanish Popular Party, signed the Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society. This requires coherent behaviour, yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out. The party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belongs should, according to the commitments signed in this Charter, act forcefully. It is only, as stated by Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar, through unity, responsibility and firmness that El Ejido, Spain and Europe will be able to overcome these events of which we are deeply ashamed. Mr President, one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of lynching, no less, of Moroccan day labourers which took place in El Ejido. We do not the extent to which far-right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame.	fi
The second aspect that we need to consider, in relation to the coherence of policies, is development policy in the context of the Union' s foreign policy. We know that the Union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy, and we know that, with the creation of the High Representative, of the Rapid Reaction Force and of the military crisis management capacity, there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the European Union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies. We also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue, with the adoption of common positions or joint actions, with the preparation of joint strategies, with preventive diplomacy, and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management. There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union' s foreign policy. It has to be said that, in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy, the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies. The success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy, so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy. In this context, we are convinced that we need to move away from the post¬≠colonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid. I say this because we know that, in Europe, development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain Member States, in view of the post-colonial concerns of those states. The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States' policy. Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States' policies with the European Union' s development policy. If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies, it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy. Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention, regarding development policy, is, of course, the Development Council. There have been discussions, especially in recent months, about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies. As you know, there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other EU policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the EDF' s financing, or rather lack of financing. It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union' s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions, which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils, in other decision-making forums, ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council. Up to now, the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions.	fr
The UN has a peace plan. We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end. I also want to take up the subject of migration. I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries, which might make it easier to expel immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds. I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms. We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds. Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age. This is not because of a lack of food, but because of what we have talked a lot about today, namely increasing poverty. Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests. I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply, specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason. I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce. Women appear to be completely absent from all areas, especially development policy when, of course, we are not in reality absent at all. Mr President, the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid. The level of aid is naturally important, and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased. This ought to be done with, in particular, a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity. However, the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries. A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed. The latter include trade, agricultural and fisheries policies. Other important areas are, of course, the flow of private investments, cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with, and finances solutions to, a variety of global problems which affect us all. These problems include questions of climate, health issues, biodiversity etc, and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation, that is to say the new economy which is developing. In this economy, the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked. In my opinion, what we are discussing here today is partly the EU' s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance. The report, or survey, which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded, showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be, is naturally quite crucial. I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more.	fr
"However, with these points and the majority decision by Parliament, we now have a situation in points 53 and 54 in which alternative lifestyles enjoy special favour and are placed above the family, as a result of which we find it impossible to vote for the report as a whole. Mr President, I just wanted to add to what Mr Pirker has said by pointing out that I voted in favour of point 42 of the Haarder report despite the fact that it contains an error because Austria is named in connection with freedom of movement. The executive committee of the Nationalrat (National Assembly) has passed a resolution unanimously adopting the motion for the executive committee to reach an agreement under paragraph 2 of the Law of 3 April 1919 on the resolution by the Federal government of 26 March 1996 and to consider the declarations of renunciation by Felix Habsburg-Lothringen and Karl Ludwig Habsburg-Lothringen as adequate, so that nothing now stands in the way of their being issued with passports which will allow them to enter Austria. I am therefore able to tell the House that both Felix Habsburg-Lothringen and Karl Ludwig Habsburg-Lothringen have valid passports without any form of restriction. Neither signed the declarations of renunciation required by the constitutional office, because they have distanced themselves from the house of Habsburg; instead they merely entered the following statement on their passport applications: ""In order to avoid misunderstandings, let it be noted in this connection that I, the applicant, have not and do not question the republican form of government of Austria nor have I ever considered making any manner of claim to sovereignty"" . The call on Austria to take action in relation to freedom of movement is therefore devoid of any substance. - (FR) In adopting the Haarder report on human rights in the European Union, the European Parliament has just committed one of those aberrations that are so common they must be part of its nature. Among others, it is calling for equal rights of all kinds between same-sex couples and the traditional family, together with lowering the age of consent for same-sex relations. May I just remind you that Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that ""the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State"" . That same article defines the family in terms of the marriage between a man and a woman. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights repeats the same idea by declaring, in Article 10, that ""The widest possible protection and assistance should be accorded to the family, which is the natural and fundamental group unit of society"" . The reason why the traditional family is entitled to this state protection is because it provides a service without price: the renewal of the generations, the perpetuation of society, the education of children and the transmission of values. That service is a very good reason for granting the family special advantages, reserved to it alone. By ignoring that vital law, the Haarder report shows that in this respect, as in many others, the European instruments go against not only the nations but also against society itself. - (DA) We support the general recommendations in the report to the Member States regarding compliance with the international conventions on human rights. We also share the concerns referred to in the report about the situation in certain countries as regards the rights, for example, of asylum seekers, women and children and in connection with minority languages. However, we oppose the annual report on human rights being used to promote further integration within the EU. We are not in favour of the new institutional arrangements proposed in the report or in favour of the proposal that the EU should establish a common legal framework and a common policy on refugees and asylum seekers. We believe that human rights problems should be combated locally and by means of the international human rights institutions and forums which already exist and which are designed for this purpose, for example, the UN and the Council of Europe. Nor do we support the view that the EU should draw up a new, legally binding EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Rather, we are of the opinion that such a Charter would create conflicts in relation to the European Convention on Human Rights. An EU Charter of Fundamental Rights would not in itself help improve the human situation, either at European or international level. We have, however, chosen to vote in favour of the report in spite of what I have just said, for we think it is extremely important to fight for improved human rights in Europe."	fi
We can never in a million years solve Europe' s environmental problems alone. Finally, a word in the ear of those who, for financial reasons, are still hesitant: think what the alternative cost of cleaning up our seas would be. There will come a time when we shall be able to meet imperatives of this kind. We shall then be grateful if we have done everything in our power to prevent oil spills.  Mr President, I would like to state briefly that I do not believe that anyone doubts the need for a directive to tackle this problem, which is a serious problem not only for Europe, but for all seas world-wide, and that urgent and effective measures are therefore necessary. I would like to make it clear that there is a series of principles which are universal, and with which we are therefore in complete agreement. First, every port must be equipped with the necessary facilities for the treatment of waste. Secondly, polluters must pay, naturally. I agree that there may be discrepancies in exceptions regarding the type of ship or devices for measuring the length of ships. However, what cannot happen is a battle leading to a distortion in competition between the different ports, where we find ourselves with a series of theoretically environmental measures on the protection of the coast or the sea, leading to a distortion in competition between the different ports. It is therefore on this issue that effective measures must be adopted because, if we are unable to adopt a suitable solution, then this directive will end in outright failure. And the only outcome will be that some ports are advantaged and others disadvantaged, all due to fine words on the environment leading to a competitive war between ports. The logical solution, for example, would be to establish the principle of a single tariff for all European ports, a tariff that is exactly the same, that would not give rise to any type of distortion in competition, or similar measures. Any decision that, for example, enables the Member States to grant subsidies to the different ports, would end up distorting competition and would ultimately be ineffective. Mr President, I share your love of the sea, and your love of diving and sailing, and I sincerely believe that all those present are concerned about how we can guarantee clean seas for current and future generations. I believe that the work we are discussing today is a great step forward. In this respect, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, and the whole of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for their painstaking work throughout the discussion and throughout the negotiation of this initiative. As you know, the Commission is extremely concerned about marine pollution. I hope that I will shortly be able to provide you with a preliminary package of measures with the aim of monitoring the safety of oil tankers more effectively, measures that I hope we will be able to go on with, specifically making the most of the dramatic sinking of the Erika, a dramatic event which could mean that on this occasion we are able to overcome certain very specific interests that will undoubtedly be affected by the measures I shall be proposing in the near future. However, while it is certain that accidents lead to tremendous problems and disasters, the reality is that most spillages result, not from accidents, but simply from the regular cleaning out of the holds of certain ships, which is obviously a totally reprehensible act.	de
Stability, security and peace in the Maghreb region depend on this referendum taking place. For the referendum to lead to the fulfilment of those objectives, however, the preparatory work must be done with great care, especially the correct compilation of the full electoral roll, which has still not been achieved, and strict fulfilment of the criteria governing its compilation must be insisted on. The European Union must fully assume its role of mediator in this process, which is important not just for the region itself, but also for the whole of Europe, and especially for certain countries. It must carry out that role by, amongst other things, supporting the decisions of the United Nations and ensuring that the process reaches a conclusion in total transparency and with maximum guarantees, complete probity and respect for democracy. Mr President, after the vote in East Timor, the process of self-determination in Western Sahara is the last one outstanding in the world. But it is a process of self-determination which grows more complicated by the day, as highlighted last week by news of the repression taking place in the occupied territories of Western Sahara. On the proper conclusion of this process of self-determination depend the stability, peace and indeed the economic integration and development of the whole Maghreb. I would even say that the transition to full democracy apparently under way in the Kingdom of Morocco also depends on it. From our point of view, the culmination of the process of self-determination in Western Sahara lies in the application of the peace plan from the United Nations and the Organisation for African Unity. And the core of that peace plan is precisely the holding of a free and fair referendum on self-determination, in which voters can make their choice without any kind of pressure. In spite of the efforts of the United Nations, in spite of MINURSO, in spite of the progress that has been made in compiling the electoral roll, the referendum keeps being postponed virtually sine die. Of course, the delay of the referendum is essentially the responsibility of one of the parties, which is failing to finalise acceptance of the terms under which the said referendum is to take place. For that to happen, for self-determination to become a reality in Western Sahara in the short term, the available instruments must be used: the Houston Agreements and the efforts of James Baker. Direct dialogue between the parties is essential. The Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front must restore the direct dialogue which existed at the end of the 1980' s and which led to the Houston Agreements. The European Union should make it a priority to help keep that process going, to help it succeed. Regrettably, the Union has not acted in the most appropriate way up to now. Much has been said, but little has actually been done. The most important point in the resolution we are going to adopt here today is the European Parliament' s call to the Council to take common action, as provided for in the Treaty on European Union, on Western Sahara. And that means statements and instruments, making all the instruments we have at our disposal available to help bring this process of self-determination to a satisfactory conclusion, assist Mr Baker, support the United Nations, call on the parties to respect the terms of the international resolutions and set in motion essential humanitarian cooperation. That is how we can contribute to achieving a priority objective: peace in the Maghreb. Self-determination in Western Sahara is essential for that. Mr President, I should like on behalf of my Group to voice our serious concern at the current situation in the Western Sahara to the European Parliament and, more importantly, the Commission and the Council. The constant postponement of the referendum on the future of the Western Sahara is unacceptable. A state of emergency reins in the occupied areas. At least 56 people have been arrested, including 27 women, for fighting for the right to self-determination. We call on the government of Morocco to stop repression, lift the state of emergency and permit freedom of expression. We call on the Council of the EU to vote on joint action which will enable the peace plan to be duly implemented without delay. The previous involvement of the personal envoy of the UN Secretary General, Mr James Baker, should be used for further mediation work in a bid to implement UN Security Council Resolution No 1292/2000.	fi
However, if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy, we will end up totally frustrated and, furthermore, the result will be negative. As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics, it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out. The result of this absurd game is not zero, but rather a minus number, as a consequence of the material, financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise. With regard to policy, this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another. In today' s globalised world, this fact is all the more obvious. There are no boundaries for Community policies. I am therefore glad that the Commission and the Council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of Community policies, and that, together with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the services of the Commission, they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union. Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state, in their respective working programmes, that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries, but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence. Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied. For example, the Commission, in its long term guidelines, says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity, supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account. The Commission is addressing a very important area, that is, commercial policy. However, this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development, agriculture, fisheries policy, immigration, our position in international financial institutions, the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform. The Council - and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time, it is true, being in November 1999, and also on other occasions, such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results. Since the Development Council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say, as some previous speakers have pointed out. However, as Parliament, we wish to propose - as others have said and as the resolution states - the creation of an inter-service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different Community policies, which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves. What we really want, however, is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination, complementarity and, the most complex one, which we are discussing at the moment, coherence, will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union. Let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the Intergovernmental Conference, the reform of the Commission - which will also affect the development services -, this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement, to perfect a more coherent political union.	de
I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference, not merely to relations between the Union and Member States, but also the Union, the Member States, regions and cities. I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe, Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears. Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms. Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this type, form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki? I do not think so. Are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion, unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking? Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission. I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated. In terms of social protection, I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology. In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people. This will therefore be our rule. We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic. I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues. I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical. This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27. Mr MacCormick, I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals. It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots. If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity.	fr
I feel that the two Presidents were right not to include this point in their agendas: there is a time and place for everything and, of course, the priorities are different at different levels. I feel that it was right for the two highest representatives of Parliament and the Commission to tackle the most sensitive issues of the peace process which, as we are aware, is still running into difficulties. We need to lend this peace process our full support, and our concern over the issues described in the question put by Mrs Morgantini is not preconceived, nor is it indicative of a negative attitude towards any of the parties concerned. We are being cruel to be kind. We are being strict with our friend, the Israeli Government, to prevent repetition of these illegal occurrences and irregularities, as they are damaging to everyone involved. Seen in this perspective, this initiative should also be viewed as positive, and as an initiative intended to further the Middle East peace process. Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that the present trade agreement between Israel and the EC is ambiguous. It is also very difficult to establish the origin of the products in question. I can therefore only concur that it is desirable for some light to be shed on the matter soon. There are, nonetheless, a number of other important factors which we need to take into consideration. Indeed, we are all agreed that the recent revival of the peace negotiations must be encouraged and not hampered. Israel and the Palestinians are currently involved in intense negotiations concerning their future borders. Any attempt by anyone, including by any third party, to define - let alone impose - the territorial area to be adopted for trading purposes is therefore premature. In my opinion, it seems preferable to await the findings of the tripartite working group, to be convened on the initiative of Israel, the European Commission and also the Palestinians for the purpose of examining the origin rules. I am pleased that the Commissioner shares this view. Hopefully, this working party will find a temporary solution to the problem within the existing legal framework without jeopardising the peace process. For this peace process deserves absolute priority, and we in the European Community and in Europe should not put any obstacle whatsoever in the way of this process. There seems to be remarkable consensus in the House today but I would like to make a few points. Here in the Parliament trade in the Middle East has always been a political flashpoint. We are major donors but we have, unfortunately been marginalised in terms of policy and political influence for too long in the Middle East and we can contribute positively, as many speakers have said today, just as we did in the case of Northern Ireland. We are major consumers of goods from both Israel and the occupied territories, indeed trade is probably our main political strength in the area and ensuring the promotion of the rule of law is our best political asset as we seek to contribute to the peace settlement. Borders are being shut down, sometimes arbitrarily, and sometimes following a terrorist attack.	fr
In that respect, Ireland falls short, like other Member States, but we hope that the pressure we are exerting will produce results. I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good. The Rules of Procedure do not allow this. You will have to discuss this outside the Chamber. Questions to Mr Barnier Question No 44 by (H-0020/00):  Subject: Partnership arrangements and the third community support framework for Greece The recent Regulation (EC) 1260/1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds places greater emphasis than the previous regulation on stronger partnership, involving the regional and local authorities and other public bodies, the economic and social partners and all other relevant bodies not only in the preparation but also in the funding, monitoring and assessment of the measures taken. However, local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that 'partnership' arrangements under the new CSF for Greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance. Has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies? In what way have the local authorities be given a greater say in the preparation and administration of the third CSF and what steps will the Commission take to ensure greater participation by the 'partners' in all measures taken under the new CSF? May I quickly add something to the answer given just now by Mrs Wallstr√∂m to Mr Martin? This was a joint letter between our two predecessors and I consider, as the successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies, that this letter is still valid. I will actively endeavour with Mrs Wallstr√∂m to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the Structural Funds with the EU environmental directives and policies. I am also saying this as a former environment minister. Turning now to the question posed by Mr Alavanos, who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject, the Commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor, during the preparation of the new programming period, the application of the partnership principle. The involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community' s action is, as you know, one of the essential elements of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation. With regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece, the Commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the 2000-2006 period. Mr Alavanos knows that I have been to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster. During these visits, I held discussions with the Greek Government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement. As for subsequent phases, in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes, it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level. It must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the CSF at national, regional and local level.	el
As indicated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measures, on the other hand, are minimal as far as employment is concerned. Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for. Also, the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions. Mr President, it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities, especially in connection with boosting employment. It is, after all, they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit. By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and, if necessary, tying this in with financial aid, a higher return can be achieved. Surely this must be the ultimate goal. I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions. Following on from this, it is probably also more meaningful, with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say anyway. By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a great deal of problems later on. Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries. The report shows that, in general, they are a long way behind EU countries, especially in terms of GDP per capita. With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future, it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy. I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later. Mr President, Commissioner, following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part. For example, whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased, there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect. Equally, unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all, indeed they rose in some cases. I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently. Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries. Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment, then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training. Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base. If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term, then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.	el
"The German version is not very clear here. I would ask for that to be checked again. For the rest, I warmly thank our rapporteur. It is a difficult subject and I hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now. Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report. I must add that it is a welcome change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions. When it comes to the IGC, she is one of what the French call ""les pures et dures"" : no compromise, no deals with the other institutions; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions. Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament' s original position on the issue of comitology. Let us remember what is at stake here. Parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new Council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement. Firstly, the whole system is obscure. It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees. Here is a real step forward, in the new system that has been agreed. We are to know who is on each committee. We are to know when they meet. We are to get the agendas. We are to get the documents that are sent to them. The whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex. So that is at least a step forward. Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission. We adopt legislation in the European Union. We expect the Commission to implement it. And then we have a system designed to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the ""contre-filet"" system, under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned. Here too there is at least some progress. The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States represented in the Council. That is a more reasonable system. That, too, is a step forward. But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied. The first criticism is of the system whereby the Commission is monitored, scrutinised, controlled if you like, only by a committee appointed by Member States or the Council not by Parliament. The legislative authority, Council and Parliament, should be equal. We confer implementing powers on the Commission, but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure. Parliament has no equivalent power. True, we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system."	de
In addition, we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions, which may be used for any purposes whatsoever. It is therefore ... (The President cut the speaker off) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Council Presidency' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness. We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve. The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track, although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament' s motions are anything to go by. There is more to be said on that score. It is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick; that of the power to act, democratic legitimacy and transparency. In the end, it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens. At the same time of course, we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union. If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is. The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade. This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union' s being able to function come what may. This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned, and legislation and in relation to treaties, which entail changes being made to legislation. Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament' s corresponding powers in this area. In addition, we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union, for there is a lack of supervision in this area. The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting, when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council, which is an unacceptable way to go on. Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank. However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side. Furthermore, the tripartite relationship of Commission, Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy, where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures, for which the Commission alone has responsibility. The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this. We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference. The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate. There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to. The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country' s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor.	el
It sounds good, saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge. But water is not free of charge, any more than houses or food are free of charge. It is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource. I also want to add that, when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities, I support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules. I also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances. In the course of the debate, many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed. I just want to emphasise this further. It is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them. This is also expressed in Recital 14. Allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that, in common with my Scottish colleague, he need have no pangs of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again. We have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production. Allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail. Limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives. I am glad to see that Parliament' s amendments have focused upon this. The Commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the OSPAR Convention into the text. We must, however, keep to their precise scope and content. As I said, their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character. It would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable. It must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables. I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 . The Commission cannot, on the other hand, approve Amendment No 19, in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR. The Commission' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances, and so no definition is needed. Even if I too agree with the contents of Amendments Nos 79 and 106, these go beyond the commitments under OSPAR, and I cannot therefore approve these Amendments. The Commission can also, in principle, approve Amendment No 60, according to which a timetable is required for implementing the Commission' s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances. Amendment No 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed. This would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot, therefore, be approved. The desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved. Lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances. I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way alter existing Community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector. The Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive.	de
In Ireland some services are provided by companies from outside Ireland, for example, English companies certainly operate there. But this directive has never been transposed into national law. It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives. That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government. A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators. But the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the Netherlands they have liberalised, in Germany they have not, yet German companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the Netherlands. This is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the Union. I come from a rural area. I support the principle of liberalising and the right of everybody to compete and I recognise the benefits that common regulation and liberalisation has brought over the years. For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago. I remember when people came into this House lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation. We allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education. Our older people, even though on social welfare, can enjoy the benefits of travel. So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living. On the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided. So, the Commission, in bringing forward their new proposals, must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services. In rural areas, for many years, even before the Irish Free State came into existence, we sometimes had this service of a post office. Today, it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that European legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it. I want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service. But complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in Ireland. I want the Commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service. It should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas. We must implement what the directive insists on, that the postal service is available to everybody. Mr President, Commissioner, besides the fact that the postal services doubtless play an extremely important part in providing employment, they are very helpful in the effort to achieve the cohesion we all want so much and which is a basic reason for the European Union' s existence. As is known, the Commission should already, before the end of 1998, have tabled new proposals for a revision of the Postal Services Directive 97/67, guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service, securing its economic viability, and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved, including postal workers and customers. To that end, the Commission has commissioned studies on the cost of universal services, the consequences of liberalising cross-border mail and direct mail, the consequences of reducing weight and cost limits in the reserved sector, the consequences of liberalising the other phases of the postal process, excluding distribution, and an overall appraisal of the results of those studies. Mr President, we are therefore wondering, and we ask the Commission - although, of course, Mr Bolkestein is not here, but Mr Monti is a man of many parts and I think he may have a view on this: should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each, and I repeat, on each one of the European Union' s Member States? The postal services in Greece, Great Britain, the Netherlands or Belgium are, of course, all different. With liberalisation, how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own, Greece, with its particular geographical features and its numerous, small but inhabited islands?	fi
They are growing, but only in terms of GDP. They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions. Commissioner, please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority, because this is our citizens' greatest problem. Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require. Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy. It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty. Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments, occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter' s report. Everyone understands, Mrs Schroedter, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time limits involved - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays, since we are discussing this report right now, as the representative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming. Mrs Schroedter, you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters, European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires, and is the justification for, a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out. So, ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you, Mrs Schroedter, and the various Members of this House, have made. Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1, 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds. This means putting forward the Commission' s priorities, based on past experience in implementing the programmes, as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations.	de
I have, in fact, always thought that insisting on a settlement of the present situation, in which one-third of this republic' s territory is occupied by Turkey, before starting negotiations with Cyprus was quite unfair. On a more general note, it is true that the socio-economic situation in these two countries is far better than in other candidate countries. However, they have received technical assistance and financial aid from the European Union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire. Until 1999, this technical assistance and financial aid was provided under the fourth financial protocols (B7-4011). Both countries also qualify for financial aid under the MEDA programme (B7-4012). During the first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament stressed that the new 'pre-accession' heading (B7-0), proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget, should not be limited to the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe and should also be extended to Malta and Cyprus. However, because of the Council' s refusal to negotiate a review of the ceiling set for heading 7 (pre-accession) in the Financial Perspectives, the European Parliament agreed, by way of exception, and I stress that it was by way of exception, that this expenditure should be financed under heading 4 (external action) of the Financial Perspectives for the year 2000. At the same time, the European Parliament created a new heading: 'pre-accession strategy for Mediterranean countries' (B7-04), under which two new articles were created for the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus pending the Commission' s presentation, following the Helsinki European Council, of the necessary legal bases and a review of the ceiling for heading 7 of the Financial Perspectives. This proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases! . I welcome Mr Brok' s report supporting with amendments the Commission' s proposals seeking to prepare Cyprus and Malta for EU membership. The package will grant around Euro 15 million in total for the two countries in the current year. It is, however, regrettable that the Commission has eschewed multiannual financing and decided instead to allocate funds on a yearly basis. This is bound to have an impact on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan spending. The funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the Community 'acquis' . Given the already advanced state of these two countries, compared to other applicants, this should easily allow them to be 'technically and administratively' ready for membership at the end of the 5-year programme. Cederschi√∂ld report (A5-0020/2000) . (FR) As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the last parliamentary term, I welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increasing protection for our single currency. The Union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting. Consumers and traders are still not familiar with the euro and it would be easy for counterfeit money to be passed in supermarkets, bureaux de change and banks and not be noticed straight away. And the fact that coins are to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify. The European information centres, which are already playing a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency, should step up their campaigns to raise public awareness of counterfeiting. On another level, we must ensure that Community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting. As far as criminal sanctions are concerned, measures are needed to guarantee protection for the euro from the outset and this is the purpose of the draft framework decision on increasing protection by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting presented by the European Parliament. The purpose of the framework decision is to supplement the provisions of the International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency of 20 April 1929 and to facilitate its application by the Member States. Each Member State must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable. These offences must be punishable even if they relate to banknotes and coins denominated in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 January 2002.	fi
I do not know if he is still present and can hear me. What is left of the human rights of those who sympathise with the Vlaamsblok, one of the most important parties in the Flemish region, if tomorrow the Belgian Parliament adopts the implausible, indecent and ignominious bill tabled by its main political rivals, the Volksunie, which seeks quite simply to abolish the party? What is left of the right to engage in a critical study of history when authors and publishers are persecuted, as the young historian Jean Plantin was just yesterday before the Court of Appeal, in my home town of Lyon - he was the subject of an absurd, arrogant and offensive closing speech by the public prosecutor Jean-Olivier Viout, the smug expression of straitjacketed thinking and intellectual conformism? It is a strange concept of human rights when peaceful patriotism is fraudulently equated with aggressive nationalism, when legitimate protests against immigration policies are equated with I do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identities is equated with racism. What of the human rights of the millions of French people who voted for the National Front and who are deprived of any political representation and vilified daily, as they were on Monday on the television channels of the state to which they are required to pay taxes, when the simple expression of justifiably exasperated views by one of our colleagues, Mr Le Pen, is used as a pretext for iniquitous condemnation, in violation of the law and in violation of all notions of justice, fairness and morals, and when attempts are made, in violation of the clearest legislation, to deprive this representative of millions of our fellow citizens of the mandate which he has been given by their vote, not received as a favour from the government. In a word, I shall believe your talk about human rights in Europe, fellow Members, when you acknowledge that your political opponents have the same rights as you allow yourselves. I shall believe your talk about human rights in China when you name the real cause of the problem, i.e. Communism. Listen to the resounding voice of Solzhenitsyn in his letter to the Americans, in which he says that the main cause of the weakness of Western society is excessive pandering to legal individualism, an individualism which, far from allowing people to flourish, paves the way for future dictatorship, in fact the worst kind of dictatorship, because those whom it enslaves are not even aware of their terrible servitude. Mr President, the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political legacies of the 20th century. The holocaust, fifty years ago, led to the need to lay down a number of fundamental rights and freedoms. Since the end of the cold war, compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation. Leaders violating these principles now face international criticism, sanctions and are even brought to trial, such as ex-dictators like Mr Pinochet have experienced. These developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very disquieting. Especially in situations of war, civilians are given less consideration all the time. It seems contradictory. Never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed. Never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries. Yet the most basic rules of conduct are being flouted on a massive scale and there are more civilian victims than there were a century ago. Women are systematically raped. Children are conscripted by force and deployed in battle. Excesses are no longer the exception, they have unfortunately become the rule. This applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide. Too late, too selective and too fragmented: this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community. First of all, the policy comes too late. Both in Rwanda and Kosovo, the UN, despite the many warnings, appeared to be overtaken by events and stood by as a helpless observer of the massacres, as President Havel pointed out this afternoon. Fifty years later, we are still unable to prevent genocide. We should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency. Control of the arms trade and improved media control are essential in this. The human rights policy is also too selective. The months of NATO bombardments of Kosovo and the mediation attempts in the Middle East are in stark contrast to international apathy with regard to the conflicts in Africa.	fi
And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent. It is in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement. Very rapid and direct involvement of south-east Europe in the life of the European institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the European Parliament, and that staff from those countries could work in the Court of Justice and the Commission. But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development. With this in mind, we have presented some amendments which I hope Parliament will accept. First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted. Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system. Thirdly, world aid and assistance coming into the region, and hence into Macedonia as well, should be clearly multilateral, and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country. Mr President, Commissioner, we hope the agreement can achieve all its objectives but we cannot delude ourselves that peace, stability and prosperity in south-east Europe can be achieved without dealing with the very wide-ranging problems we are trying to eliminate. I am referring to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, the need to involve Serbia in the region' s reconciliation process and - why not? - new discussions on relations between the European Union, NATO and the UN, in the light of the new balance that needs to be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty, which I think calls for a change in the existing UN Charter. Mr President, Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has knocked everything off balance. This is certainly true for the relations between the European Union and the western Balkans. Since then, expectations have been high. This applies to them and us. This is true on their part because - whether we like it or not - they are asking us for direct aid and they are wondering what Europe wants from them at the end of the day? Is there any prospect of membership? This is very much on their minds. But here too, within the European Union, expectations are high.	el
"There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation. Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see. That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform. If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a ""hand-up"". I urge the House to support these changes. Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work. The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions. Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment. These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines. Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life. Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland. In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best. Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that. However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy. Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it. The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South."	fr
The Commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field. I should, of course, like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role played by the European Parliament' s Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, particularly its chair. I should just like to recall that, during the lengthy process of approving the present Commission, every Commissioner was questioned by the Women' s Committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field. We shall be monitoring each Commissioner carefully, so the other Commissioners have now been forewarned. Thank you for your reply. I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields. I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes. Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work. I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes. This is a crucial goal. In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required. . (SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do. In the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General, issues of equality play a very important role. For example, I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission. If we are to be able to motivate everybody, I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or, if you prefer, from the bottom up. My impression of environment-related work, broadly speaking, is that in many instances it is dominated by women. This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field. I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention, but there is certainly room for improvement. I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up. I hope that this will be of benefit. Question No 43 by (H-0045/00): Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission's insistence.	fr
It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme. I should like to make one further point before I conclude: we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious URBAN development policy. This, unfortunately, is not the case in Ireland. I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market. The development partnerships are a very clever idea, even though they are experimental. I have two major concerns, however, about the development partnerships. They should be accessible to smaller groups, accessible for them to be able to devise, implement and monitor the programmes. We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme. I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon, so that it becomes accessible to everyone. I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report, but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all. My second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems, for example, disabled people' s access to the workplace. Projects should also specifically address this problem. These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes. I certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the West Midlands. I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees. Although I am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with repatriation, having access to EQUAL, I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugees. It is only fair and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way as everyone else. Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, with the LEADER report, rural development is very much to the fore. This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying, especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union' s rural development policy. It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning, but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as, for example, areas experiencing depopulation. It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme, local operators have combined forces, debated and prepared projects. These programmes have, therefore, been important channels for participative democracy, the rationale of the citizen for Europe. So, the concept for LEADER+ should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes. One urgent question is therefore raised: why, when this programme has been successfully run for ten years, is LEADER+ still classed as experimental? Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful? For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development?	el
That concept I reject firmly, because competition is there for the citizens, and for them alone. Most companies hate competition. Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens, their economic interest and for their liberty. The examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in telephony services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this. I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday, in the appropriate committee, more competently and in much more detail. Thank you very much, Commissioner. Pursuant to Rule 42(5), I have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate. The debate is closed. We shall now proceed to the vote. (Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE We voted in favour of the resolution because we received a request to this effect from a French postal service trade union which was looking to obtain, in the event of a favourable vote, an additional time frame in which to defend employees. This does not mean that we approve the entire contents, which are too vague and which leave out the main concern. The policy undertaken by the European institutions and by national governments, especially the French government, is a retrograde policy, counter to the interests of both the service users, i.e. the great majority of the population, and the postal service workers. Postal services must continue to be public services. All people, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions. In organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability, and private firms must not be authorised to amass private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities. Consequently, the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of Europe must keep their monopoly of this service. In order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the European Union level, it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices, reducing the number of deliveries and overworking postal staff. The post office and, more generally, all public services must, on the other hand, recruit additional staff. Such jobs are unquestionably useful, and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe. Mr President, personally I voted in favour of this resolution, because the essential thing is that the European Parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation. If we dismantle the public service, this would be very serious, and we wish to know what are the Commission' s intentions. Saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate. People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so.	fr
I think the approach taken in these reports is a kind of violation of our terms of reference. For instance, the Ludford report proclaims equality between European citizens and third country nationals and goes so far as to propose that non-nationals can be employed as European officials in the same way as Member State nationals, or that they enjoy the same rights of unchecked freedom of movement and family reunification as EU nationals. The differences are being ironed out at every level, for the Haarder report also supports equal rights for same-sex couples and the traditional family. The two reports also join forces in calling for the right of immigrants to vote and stand for election in local and European elections. I think that second category is highly significant. For even if supposedly practical reasons could sometimes be trumped up for calling for their participation in local elections, the significance of their participation in European elections is purely ideological. Its aim is to show that the future Europe must not be a super-nation (even if there is a super-state) but, on the contrary, an open field, a crossing point where the rights taken away from the nations would be redistributed all over the world. Another revealing point common to both reports is that they call for the proposed new 'rights' to be enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of EU citizens, now being drafted, on which I gave my views the day before yesterday during the debate on the Duff¬≠Voggenhuber report. And, of course, they insist that, in future, this document must be legally binding on the Member States. That is another aspect that shows that this Charter, if it really was adopted in the form called for by the European Parliament - but which we will oppose absolutely - would have the effect of a mechanism for reducing the powers of the nations. Here as ever we see that the European level is the point of least resistance in face of pressure groups, of extraneous minorities, even of foreign interests. And once again we draw the same lesson: the citizens must keep a close guard on their powers and only delegate them where necessary to transparent institutions, devoted to their defence and over which they have full control. - (DA) We are in favour of the humanitarian angle from which the report has been drawn up. We are in favour of the report focusing upon the breeding grounds for racism and xenophobia in Europe. We think it is important to combat racism and xenophobia by guaranteeing citizens the rights to education, access to the labour market etc. It is also positive that the report should recommend that citizens of third countries should have better opportunities for integration. For the aforesaid reasons, we have chosen to vote in favour of the report, since we basically think it is extremely important to combat racism and xenophobia. We would emphasise, however, that we cannot support the means of combating racism and xenophobia that the report recommends.	el
Secondly, encouraging exchanges, mobility and training in the cultural sector. Thirdly, promoting cooperation between cultural operators. Fourthly, increasing audiences for culture, with particular emphasis on attracting young people to culture and, fifthly, protecting the common cultural heritage on the European scale as well as the history of the peoples of Europe, and making them better known. The new programme will, I am sure, in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency, efficiency and balance, prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures. Madam President, I reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its support and for, once again, having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the Union. I am certain that it will not be disappointed, having given us its support, and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed, as things progress, of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens, which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union. Thank you, Commissioner. I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow. (The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.) End-of-life vehicles The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles [8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz) Mr President, nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe. Even though they can no longer be driven, these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders; and not just intra-Community borders, but also those outside the Union. It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed. We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking. We therefore have a number of amendments. I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective. I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive. Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included, as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a European directive in this area. I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either. I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas. This is my main concern in this matter. In my opinion, the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe. This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars. This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc.	el
In addition, the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor. They will lock in the economic reforms, just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties' commitments under the agreements. The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction. Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU' s trade regime for all least-developed countries, 39 of which are actually in the ACP group. This process will take place in the coming five years so that, by 2005, the LDCs' exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market. As regards the volume of the next EDF, the EU has made its financial proposal. It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective. Today about EUR 9.5 billion of previous EDF resources are uncommitted. The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances, plus the new EDF resources, over a seven-year period, that is to say, before the entry into force of the next financial protocol. This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period. We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity, we are moving into a period of increased activity. Such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides. There is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such, and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries. Turning to our development policy, I would say that the global context has changed drastically. The marginalisation of many economies, increased poverty in the world, the need for better management of environmental interdependence, the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns. It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves. Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned. To focus on the input coming from the evaluations, I would mention the following problems: the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence. This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States. The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures and institutional mechanisms. Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities. Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage.	fr
But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps. We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility, the excessive mandatory levies. But let us not forget that there is another one, a new handicap, with the single currency. In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances. This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission' s report. But, in reality, we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation. If you add the strangeness of a single currency that is not built upon a State, itself based upon a people, you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the markets' suspicion of the euro. Indeed, it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999, as it favoured growth in an unexpected way, but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is, in fact, symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions. Mr President, the present draft resolution is controversial. Given the topic it covers, this is hardly surprising. It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned. The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment, but it is, in fact, a short-term policy. Even if he advocates sustainable growth, sustainability does not come into it. Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy. More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity. The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes. If Member States do not do anything about this, there will be even fewer means for care, education and other important public amenities in the future. An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd. It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which, at 2%, is now at its maximum permitted level. If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again. What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular. High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting.	fr
"I believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in Cyprus before admitting this country to the European Union. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the view of the Greek Communist Party is that the main problem of Cyprus is not its accession to the European Union but the occupation of 40% of its territory by Turkey, which has continued for 26 years. Regardless of the national origin of each Cypriot, the future of the Cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country. The only acceptable solution that guarantees the future, that leaves no room for foreign interventions, like those that led to all the problems of the last fifty years, is a unified and federal Cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the UN' s Security Council. The key to solving the Cyprus problem is in the hands of the Turkish Government, which supports and encourages the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leader Raouf Denkta¬∫. For its part, the European Union, with its hypocritical professions of interest in freedom and human rights, has never been moved by the drama of the Cypriot people, by the problem of Greek and Turkish Cypriot refugees, by the enforced change of the population composition in the north of Cyprus, or by the wholesale settlement of colonists by Turkey in the occupied areas. Even in this Chamber, the Council' s representative referred to the north of Cyprus and not to the occupied territories. The recent Helsinki decision to grant Turkey accession country status, even though it has made not the slightest concession over the issue of its occupation of Cyprus, for example, by reducing its military presence there or giving back Ammokhostos, is clearly encouraging Turkey' s intransigence. It is not by chance that, immediately after Helsinki, the Turkish Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit, stated that the Cyprus issue had been resolved in 1974. Encouraging Turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the UN Secretary General. On their course towards accession, the people of Cyprus have already lost a great deal, but stand to lose even more. The application of the acquis communautaire has created serious problems for the Cypriot economy, especially in agriculture. It entails the liquidation of the public sector, and it dislocates and destroys the developed system of social solidarity that exists in Cyprus. Mr President, I beg your pardon, but the French interpreter made a small error, on the most sensitive word in the debate, during the translation of what Mr Alyssandrakis just said. I just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity. Mr Alyssandrakis was translated as saying ""the confederate solution would be best"" . Obviously, he said ""the federal solution would be best"" . It is a most important point and needs to be clarified, Mr President. Thank you very much for the clarification Mr Wurtz. Mr President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland Europe. The Maltese in particular have been very good at surviving in hostile geographical and geopolitical environments. Their success has relied in great part on their enterprise, their dynamism and their flexibility. Malta has vibrant light and heavy industry, growing financial services, good agriculture, magnificent tourism and an amazing range of employment opportunities, all of this on an island virtually barren of natural resources."	de
With regard to the parliamentary procedure, I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken, especially the rapporteur, because the majority of Parliament' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council, in this case practically all of them, although with some modifications. I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved. This improvement has been achieved with fresh funds, as we said at the time, and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament' s prerogatives and competences. From the point of view of the Commission, in this interinstitutional game, I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it. I would like once again to thank all the speakers, and also, especially, the Vice-President, Mr Provan, for his magnificent work throughout this debate, particularly during the conciliation procedure, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry and, also, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Ahern, and all the Members who have participated in this work. Thank you, Commissioner. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow. CULTURE 2000 The next item is the report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Gra√ßa Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ('Culture 2000') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD)). Madam President, I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate. Unfortunately, there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it. We have the feeling, and are in fact convinced, that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht. For no one is very keen to spend money on culture. Sadly that is the case and we must face facts. I would like to thank the rapporteur, who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task, in conjunction with the Commissioner of course. We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect. One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind, where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision. What kind of horse-trading system is this? Certainly not a fair one! There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side, begging for a little more money for culture. It is downright scandalous what goes on! It is an awful sort of horse-trading, based on unequal positions! Nevertheless, we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to. It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us. We will support small and medium-sized events, not the large ones, and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access.	fr
"That is how the common position has been worded. The same can be said with regard to transfers. Transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth, of solidarity between peoples and territories, because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less. Lastly, I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact. It is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but, on environmental questions, we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people, how many farmers, could be ruined by having to pay the costs. Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read, and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice, rather than just laying down doctrine. Mr President, through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union. It is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface, ground, transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and, in our case in Ireland, cross-border level. Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments. A 25-year roll-out for legislation, for example, is hardly acceptable. We have no difficulty with the ""polluter pays"" principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial, commercial and agricultural level. However, I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge, a quota per household for drinking, cooking and sanitation. We must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly. The introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977. Meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts, to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements. The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU. Water is a scarce and precious natural resource. Ideally, I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges. That would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges, with each Member States drawing up its own scheme, so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected. If Amendment No 45 does not fall, I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services."	el
Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too. We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation. Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to go in a different direction. We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes. Lastly, we need to ensure that there is proper, genuine reform of the European Commission. Yes, the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body, but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament. The information problem, which Mr Bonde just referred to, is treated like a straw in the wind, with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us, as citizens and as parliamentarians, although we have the right to it under the Treaties. The Commission is not in fact today a European government. The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament. We in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe. This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union, has its relevant role to play. Therefore we need to have credibility, coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union, from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy; even to the response by the 14, the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria. I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions. Nonetheless, I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission, that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge, inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which, to put it mildly, have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent. That does not apply to Austria alone. The Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria. However, the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and, in the final analysis, represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens. When it comes down to it, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough. In this sense, the Commission must insist, and I should like to endorse and confirm this here, that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding, enforceable rights. In this sense, the Commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom, security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speakers. Only reasonable, feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational, misleading and demagogic allegations of the extreme right. But, and I would like to stress this, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment, marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-European, nationalistic actions and reactions. In this respect, Mr President of the Commission, I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population. The feeling of being at the mercy of others, of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote, as in the European elections and, in the worst case scenario, to extremist voting patterns.	fi
The European Union is discussing issues on which it hopes that China will take concrete measures, and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union hopes China will announce positive measures at the session on 25 February. The presidency will also present to the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern. The meeting held in Beijing in October 1999 confirmed that, on the one hand, the Chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues relating to the dialogue itself, with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal forms of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention. On the other hand, they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity. Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue, while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage. On various occasions the European Union has reiterated to the Chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue, and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas. It was decided that the dialogue should continue, but in a more targeted and effective way, given that China has agreed with the European Union' s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars. Lastly, during the next Human Rights Commission there will also be a debate on rationalising the work of the Commission itself. A working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission' s mechanisms. This working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous, especially in the financial field. The European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission' s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level. . Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for Geneva on subjects like racism, civil and political rights and the right to development. As the presidency said, much remains to be done, despite the understandable request by Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should set out its position well in advance of the Geneva session. That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues. For example, discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases. It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult.	de
In this context, the European Union must consider, as it began to do early this week, how to include the neighbouring Yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything, i.e. without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime. Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation. In that regard allow me to say, since I come from a country through which the Danube flows, that I am grateful that the Commission, i.e. Commissioner Patten and also Vice-President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, is considering opening the Danube to shipping again. That would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too, which, of course, would be of particular importance to Romania. In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt. As I said, it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition. Secondly, let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union. In our view, it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now, but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date. FYROM wants to be told here and now that, in principle, accession will be possible when the time is right. This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined. It sees, in the whole readjustment of aid instruments, a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards Europe but that this train will continue through Europe while leaving FYROM on a siding. I think Commissioner Patten understands that too. So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks. Thirdly, I believe that, so far at least, FYROM has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly. Even though there will of course be readjustments here, FYROM will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being dealt with in Brussels today can in future be handled in Skopje, in the country itself. I hope that the honourable Members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM. Mr President, since the start of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this abbreviation - has behaved as a constructive peace-keeper. We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view. As you can see, our Macedonian friends have always played a very positive role and it is for this reason that it should be pointed out at this stage that Macedonia is not just a pawn in our so-called strive towards stability, but actually took the initiative.	de
We might well wonder why 76% of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country' s system of justice, and 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice... (The President cut the speaker off) Madame President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are very concerned by this debate. We cannot, and we do not, support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich. We also, however, deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country, especially one which is part of the European Union. My party at home are certainly not racists, but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well. Are you going to interfere with Great Britain' s Parliament if we are elected? Madame President, the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament. I believe they gave him 28% of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government. Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country. Then, and only then, might you consider if human rights are affected. Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then, Madame President and only then, may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union. Madam President, as a representative of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria. My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one' s own past, and the stability of democracy. Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly. The refusal of our government, down through the years, to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War, together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour, have done a great deal to bolster this negative image. This FP√ñ has now entered into a coalition with the √ñVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office. This is the citizen of a state' s prerogative, for it is the founding principle of a democracy. When the talks between the SP√ñ and √ñVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FP√ñ for their support. We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here! When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day.	fr
They hold up Sweden as a warning, which might be appropriate in certain instances, but not as regards postal services. It is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993. That is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where, in practice, there is still a monopoly, that is where the state is the only player. However, for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market, prices have fallen. That shows that competition really is working. My conclusion is therefore: make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market, too. It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for ... (The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov) I thought I had the floor. Perhaps we can discuss this later on. However, I should like to affirm that it is exactly as I said, namely, that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition, whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly. That is usually the case. That is why I should now like to see a Commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector. Mr Markov, in five or six minutes time, you will be allowed a few minutes to speak. I would be grateful if you would not interrupt other Members. Mr President, there is a mystery. What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997? There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now. I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today. I am very fond of him. He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners. It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues. There has, over this period, been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive. Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties. That has only happened recently. For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this. We really have not progressed very far. However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about. It was about gradual liberalisation; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector. These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive. The postal service is not just for Christmas. It is for life. In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service. It is about keeping communities together. The postal service is also the bus service. The postal service is also the social service. The postal service is also the doctor. If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade. We will cut them off. The postal services are important. That message must be taken back from here today. The Commission must listen to it. Mr President, we are in favour of liberalising the Union' s postal services. This should first of all stand for better service. This is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal. Liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly. Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer' s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly, because, for example, the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically? The question is, therefore: what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet? Most Member States have been putting the brakes on, and I am pleased to note that, in my country, the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago, and that the Belgian postal services and the Belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition.	fi
Mr President, it is universally recognised that rules must be observed. It is also universally recognised that our partners must also be made to observe the same rules. Everyone understands that there is concern about this today, but I would not like our demand to be regarded as selectively applicable. Nor would I like our oral question to be perceived as an indictment. Our demand is not selectively applicable and the Commission should therefore regard this as a suggestion to look into the use of Community funds in regions around Israel. And because the Commission' s investigation is not, and must not be perceived as, an indictment, I should like to mention two points which are central to the balance of our approach. Firstly, anyone familiar with the region knows that the future of the Palestinian economy is intimately linked to the economic cooperation agreement with Israel. The Oslo protocol envisages an integrated customs authority to encompass both Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Anything liable to separate the two economies would have a serious effect on cooperation between Israel and Palestine, including joint ventures, Palestinian sub-contractors and exporters. Secondly, nowhere in the agreements between Israel and the European Union are the frontiers of the State of Israel defined. The negotiations in progress between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are specifically concerned with defining these frontiers. Any attempt on the part of the European Union to impose its own idea of the territorial limits of the State of Israel would be, at the very least, lacking in tact and detrimental to these talks and to the idea of the role which we feel Europe should have in this region. I support the cautious approach which the Commissioner has taken and is taking in this matter, firstly because this is not a simple issue. It is complicated; it is always difficult to determine the origin of any goods and where they come from. No less so in the Middle East because there you have a situation where there are many joint ventures between Israel and Palestinians, where produce in some cases is partly manufactured in the Palestinian area and in the State of Israel and these developments are good things, they augur well for the future because if trade is being done in this way in the Middle East, then that will be the bedrock of any peace agreement. Therefore, because it is not an easy and simple issue, we have to be cautious and we have to be careful. The second reason why the Commission is right to proceed in this way is that if the European Union wishes to play a part in the area in securing peace then it must be seen to be fair and evenhanded. It would not be fair and evenhanded to rush into a decision without letting the talks and the groups that it is meeting determine what the situation is, both in terms of the area of the State of Israel relating to the trade agreement and, as I say, in relation to the goods and where they come from at the same time. There is I think one final reason why the Commission should be supported. We are at a delicate stage in relation to the peace agreement. You have a government in Israel which wants peace and wants to secure peace and if you proceed in a rash and rapid way then you could jeopardise the success of that peace agreement. You cannot cherrypick in negotiations, this is part of an overall settlement of some extremely complicated issues and I think the Commission is absolutely right to let these things flow through carefully in the hope that by doing so we can secure what all of us want and that is a secure and just and durable peace in the Middle East.	de
"In this light, the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic. For the first time since the Second World War, a party which is openly pro-Nazi, racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a European country. Confronted with this threat, which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe, nothing must deter us: not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit, not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene, not the derisory respect for formal democracy, and, above all, not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control. As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of R√©union, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exup√©ry, ""In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!"" This human diversity is our main sources of wealth, and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it, wherever it may exist. For all these reasons I voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria. J√∂rg Haider' s rise to power, with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FP√ñ coalition government, is a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth. The success of the Austrian Freedom Party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter, whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism. The resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of Fascism. It can be explained by the feeling of helplessness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further. In order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an apprentice dictator who is nostalgic for the Third Reich, we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrians opposed to Fascism. This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a 'European democratic model' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks downs, expels and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers, when it is not opening files on teenagers. - (DE) I have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government being formed between the √ñVP and the FP√ñ. I consider the casting of J√∂rg Haider as ""Europe's scapegoat"" (or even worse, neo-Nazi and Super Racist) to be counterproductive. Of course I, in no way, agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime. However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider's adherents."	de
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally, which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive, which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council. Nevertheless, I have tabled an amendment. Mrs Berger, in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6, you mention legal security. The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit, since all that does is create legal insecurity. You rightly raise the concern, also expressed by Mr Wieland, at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire, but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit. If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date, it must end on that date. Legal security requires this. On the other hand, with regard to point d of Amendment No 10, which refers to the first directive, you suggest that, for reasons of public security or public order regulations, a Member State may reject the validity of the card. There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive. It makes no sense for any worker within the Schengen area, since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State, and the second Member State would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory. It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity. In the case of a non-Schengen state, in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22, that possibility is contemplated, and is perfectly expressed, and I believe this provides greater legal security. The discretional power of the State, which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10, seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report. I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully, and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result. On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks. However, in the case of the United Kingdom, we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable. Partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom. Under the arrangements contained in the Treaties, the United Kingdom retains its border controls. Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation, third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described, will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State, thereby by-passing UK border controls. If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements, that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process.	el
In the last week of February, 39 instances of illegal degassing were identified in the vicinity of the wreck of the Erika alone. Such practices are intolerable, but they are difficult to monitor, particularly at night or in foggy weather. The proposed directive and the amendment proposing to establish a standard charging scheme for vessels in ports, in all European ports, in order to finance the processing of shipboard waste, tackle the problem on two fronts: they force the ports to set up the facilities and the organisation to handle the shipboard operational waste, either under direct state control or by subcontracting to specialised competent operators, and, more importantly, they deter vessels from evading their obligation to dispose of waste since they will have to pay the price in any case. It is, however, essential to ensure that, as far as possible, this universal charge is shared across the board and is supported by national or European financial arrangements to enable smaller ports to gain access to waste processing services without their economic viability and thus their continuity suffering unduly. Subject to this condition, then, what this directive proposes is Europe' s initial model response to the legitimate feeling aroused due to the pollution caused by the wreck of the Erika. To some extent, it marks the official acknowledgement and establishment of a European maritime area subject to shared regulations. - (FR) The Council must already have debated at length on the subject of this directive on port facilities for disposing of vessels' operational waste, but its final text respected the principles of stepping up the protection of the marine environment while taking account of the real situation in each of the Member States, without disrupting national practices, and this is not true of the text of the report which has just been presented to us. A State such as France has already in fact implemented the terms of the Marpol Convention by guaranteeing that each port has top quality waste disposal and processing facilities, operated by private companies, which invoice the shipowner directly according to the type and nature of the waste. Reducing the costs for use by vessels deemed to be 'ecological' is therefore only natural. This solution, which benefits the more environmentally friendly vessels, would seem to be much fairer than an arbitrary reduction in favour of the vessels labelled as 'ecological' , (and what would be the criteria for this?) or a standard contribution for the use of the facilities applied indiscriminately: we therefore refuse to replace a charging system based on the nature of the waste with a blind charging policy based on the volume of vessels, regardless of their level of risk to the environment. It must also be said that 'clearing ballast' at sea is unfortunately to a very great extent exempt from the charging system. Only inspections at sea and more frequent inspections of vessels docking in ports would be likely to reduce the amount of dumping at sea. For all these reasons the UEN Group, recalling its agreement with the Council' s common position, is now opposing the text of this report which has twisted the principles of the common position.	el
A clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice, both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer. Responsible citizens should, in my view, have a choice. We all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety. By regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently, we can help significantly to restore confidence. I too, therefore, can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments. Consequently, we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be. Mr President, this proposal to amend the 1970 directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs. In other words, we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months. That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin, antibiotic, sludge and other scandals have attracted. In other words, this is an important facet of public health protection, which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base, not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission. The amendment which the Commission has proposed, namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987, is uncontested and has our full support. However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal. The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives. Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded. This sort of monopoly, which could lead, for example, to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs, should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998. This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed. The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion, as recommended by the rapporteur, of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives, taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point. This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs. It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case, just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas, such as forest reproductive material, to mention just one example. The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect. On the one hand, it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and, on the other hand, it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs. Finally, our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur, who has gone to a great deal of trouble. I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne' s reply.	el
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse my late arrival, but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the pity. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million, and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need. The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there. However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process. Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents. Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions. I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future. It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this. However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here. One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims. In other words, we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres. Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there, we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into. This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations. It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected. This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there. This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence. We have so many coordinators, who, in turn, are responsible to so many employers, that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators. Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there. I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this, but if the European Union is doing the most work out there, then it should also be given the leadership, and bring coherence to the situation, so that we can be of real assistance to the people. It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground! Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of March - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline, that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented, and there is a steady stream of new press conferences, this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe!	de
A common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements. To this end, more extensive, compatible, uniform data is required, and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the Union' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted. However, we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities, differences, varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries, and that they will not be disregarded, penalised or even eliminated due to the misinterpretation of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies, as has sometimes occurred in the past. A case in point is the Mediterranean, including my country' s fishing industry. After years of the CFP for the Mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid, Regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy, with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation. This is a worthy objective, the implementation of which, however, has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of Mediterranean species of fish. A subsequent regulation, Regulation 1448, adopted, not by chance, in 1999, permitted certain exemptions, in particular for special cases. The time period will elapse on 31 May next, to be precise, when the Commission will present a proposal. We hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge Italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that, from the point of view of biological implications, resources are, to some extent, sustainable. Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. Combating certain fish diseases The next item is the report A5-0036/2000 by Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93/53/EEC introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases (COM(1999) - C5-0168/1999 - 1999/0191 (CNS)). Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984, then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland. Although the virus has been found in other species, the disease itself is so far confined to salmon. The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures. The Scottish salmon-farming industry is the biggest in the EU, spread throughout some of Europe' s most peripheral communities. It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually. It is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to Scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of Europe that the disease be brought under control and, if possible, eradicated. The current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be slaughtered whether affected by the disease or not.	de
On ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, all Member States stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment. Yet as things stand, only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995. The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation A legislative act, a directive, in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility, and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective, may enable us to take a major step forwards, and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste. OLAF, the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud. Accordingly, the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks, the ECB and the EIB, contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations, citing their independent status. This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting, and I hope that Parliament approves this step. The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions. It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF, which was set up at the same time as OLAF, to safeguard the independence of OLAF, however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF. I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point. In other words, there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on. There is one thing I would ask though: I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority. No, there must be no undermining of OLAF' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur' s intention. As such, I would ask you to give OLAF' s work your full support, also in its present form. Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. VOTE (Parliament approved the Commission proposal) Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE). Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4). These are both about voting. Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes, the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then, if there is some doubt, should we utilise the electronic voting system? That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call. You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it. In this particular case, I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on. Mr President, I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general.	de
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as long as nearly thirty years ago, the European Commission made attempts to draw up a European water policy. A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated. Eventually, standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances. The unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle. Some seven years ago, it still looked like the European water policy was going to be sacrificed on the altar of subsidiarity. The conservative government leaders Messrs Major and Kohl decided in a cosy fireside chat at the Edinburgh Summit that it was totally unnecessary for the Spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the Germans or English. This sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency. That position is like holey cheese, or to keep it the sphere of water, as leaky as a sieve. It explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment: nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading. This is unusual, but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes. The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak. The chemical industry and, unfortunately, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance. This is very time-consuming, and, more importantly, there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances. Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable. This is what is meant by the term ""close-to-zero"" . The Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances, many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect. These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause, even in extremely minimal quantities, changes in the gender of animals and even humans, as is more and more being ascertained by scientists. This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020. I would like to mention two substances from the Commission' s list: mercury and tributyl, abbreviated to TBT. On the bottom of the Wadden Sea, the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value, to wit, ten and one thousand times, respectively. The chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes, and if this is impossible, to apply them in closed systems. For the substance TBT, this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance. A sound alternative would be to clean the ship' s sides mechanically. I would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substances by the year 2020. Mr President, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive. The Council's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas. Therefore, our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete. As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals. Firstly, we think that the time-frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the Council. We therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive. Secondly, I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently. There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented. The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions, such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected. Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy. This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used. Nowadays, taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming. The obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay, although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases. Fourthly, we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined."	fi
So long as we continue to have unanimity, so long as yesterday the Dutch Government was able to impose those EUR 167 million as an ultimatum and so long as a government with Mr Haider will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue, we will never progress. That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the European Parliament' s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments. Madam President, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur' s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Mr Gargani, for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also, considerably difficult. Of course, we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes, but everyone hoped that the Culture programme could help to promote, for example, the unique features of each cultural sector, even - and I could say especially - of the unique features of less well-known sectors. We hope that this, at the least, will come about during the evaluation process. We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action, among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social, as well as economic, development of a people. And a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its roots, highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known. As for the important educational task which the European Union must carry out as regards culture, one of the programme' s most obvious limitations is the level of funding - we have heard this several times - which censures the fact that the Council at least - certainly not the Commissioner - is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action: the document which prioritises the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this. The overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens: this is why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme, albeit with a scarcity of funds, can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal. Madam President, I will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that I support the adoption of Culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Gra√ßa Moura, who took over from our former colleague Nana Mouskouri. Both of them have done a first-class job. Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day, culture may not seem that important, but it is; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important.  Why do I say that culture is important? Well in simple economic terms, Europe' s culture adds to genuine prosperity. Where would Europe' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture? But, more importantly than that, cultural activities are what make mankind civilised. Culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs; and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy.	el
Is that the message we want to send out? There is one other specific point which is dear to me: Member States should be able, if they so wish, to set up trans-national water transfers. This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity, which we have always defended, and, as such, should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds). I would like to remind the House that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European water networks two years ago and I would be most obliged if the European Commission could shortly tell Parliament what action it has taken on that report. . (ES) We have seen a report concerned with water quality in Europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war. We all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective, above all, given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment. It is clear that this model' s logic of private profit has been harmful, and therefore the 'polluter pays' principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences. However, apart from these principles, there is the consideration that water, as a common resource, cannot be subjected to the rules of the market. Surprisingly, I imagine with the best of intentions, this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers, and especially the agricultural sector, responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality. In fact, water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market. This means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water. By failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant, and is therefore not a problem, from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity, stifling the chances of any economic and social development, we are perverting the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon. In the same way it is somewhat ironic that we are hindering the possibility of sharing this commodity, which is scarce in some areas, while regions where there is abundant water are giving advice on austerity with regard to its use, to those who live in drought areas. As a result of this lack of sensitivity and solidarity, my vote has been consistent with what I have said, as an MEP from one of the dry Mediterranean agricultural regions - although one with prospects - namely, the Region of Murcia. . On behalf of the European Parliament Labour Party, I wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the Lienemann report, we have certain reservations. The timetable set in the report of 2020 is unrealistic and impracticable, but the timetable set by the Council of 2034 is too far in the distance. We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	fr
We shall now proceed to the vote.1 VOTE Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party, the delegation of the Spanish People' s Party, with regard to Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠' s resolution on the area of freedom, security and justice. There have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the Group of the European People' s Party, and we have voted in favour of the Terr√≥n i Cus√≠ resolution, which we consider on the whole to be excellent. However, we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6, because they seem to us to be legally incorrect. On the other hand, we have voted in favour of Recital J which, in fact, is in line with what I, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, proposed to that Committee, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference. We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13. An appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non-EU countries is something which the Spanish People' s Party has been advocating for some time. For similar reasons, we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which, with the oral amendment, dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity, since political rights, not just voting in local elections, but political rights in general terms, form part of the sovereignty of Member States. Given the oral amendment, we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done. . (DA) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the proposed resolution, but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas clash with the reservation Denmark has in the legal sphere - a reservation which the Danish delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists naturally wishes to respect. This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with 'communitisation' or the consolidation of Fortress Europe. The supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants. In terms of human rights, this is a backward step. Europe is continuing to expel nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Yet some applicant countries in central and eastern Europe are taking in gypsy refugees expelled en masse from Belgium. Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status, whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution. The Europe of Schengen clearly finds it much easier to hound the persecuted from the south than dictators, even though the UN estimates that we will need 159 million immigrants to maintain a stable population between now and the year 2025. Europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections. Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice. McCarthy report (A5-0026/2000) Mr President, I would firstly like to point out that I was Mayor of Bilbao during the nineties, which gave me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot projects to be subsidised by the Commission. Our experience with that pilot project in Bilbao led us to four conclusions: firstly, that Europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore, far from reducing the EUR 900 million for the last five year period to EUR 700 million for this five year period, the funding of this project should be increased. This should be done, for example - and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has proposed this - by reinvesting, in URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which each Member State has not spent within the time scales laid down for that purpose. Secondly, when deciding which areas must be subsidised, we must concentrate efforts on integrated projects. Disparate actions are not effective. We have to select locations by prioritising those which are most impoverished and needy, in accordance with the objectives set, that is to say, the social, economic, environmental and democratic management dimensions, as well as the relationship between them. Thirdly, we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other Community programmes, as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question. Finally, we have to put our trust in, and support, the institutions which are closest to the citizens, that is, the local councils and bodies.	fi
Mr President, I need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points Mr Coelho made. All that is indeed very true and correct. It is easy to counterfeit the euro. We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history. It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already. Yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such, counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence. It is a highly complex problem. If we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschi√∂ld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation. Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people. So what is the European Union doing about it? It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschi√∂ld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschi√∂ld, but more at the procedures that are being applied. The manner in which the Council, which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy. We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment. Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months. It is only thanks to the immense efforts of Mrs Cederschi√∂ld and to Parliament' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages, that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the Council, so that the decision scheduled for March can indeed be taken. On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us. So let me state quite clearly here, on behalf of my group, that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschi√∂ld whether it is reasonable to work like this. We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure. This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress. Only, as Mrs Cederschi√∂ld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited.	fr
Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA and PHARE programmes. This coordination is at present lacking, and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it. We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible. It is of decisive importance to get local business, organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes. Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful. Projects have often remained half-finished, and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy. We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement. Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee. I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the explanatory statements, has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission' s guidelines. It will not work as an automatic target, but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions. This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds. Here, projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries. Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money, that is only for the borders within the EU. But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation. The regulation pretends that there is one, but there is not. The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time. The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded. Since 1996, Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties. Nothing has happened! The difficulties are once again being allowed to persist, to the detriment of the regions concerned. Parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation, and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners. We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers! Mr President, a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes. According to my group, this is excellent if, as a result of this, deprivation within regions, towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved.	el
This legal framework is fleshed out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the Commission and the Council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management. On the contrary, I would say that, although many areas of European policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence, in this instance I would claim, on behalf of the Commission and the Council, that we have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy. . (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, now that the Commissioner has explained to us, in an extremely coherent manner, that the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council and his Minister of State for Europe bore responsibility for the lack of coherence, perhaps you could help the Commissioner and ourselves, so as to enable us to take this decision. It would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the Financial Perspective up until 2004 and on heading B7, or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence, which is something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission. . (PT) Mr President, I am sure that the issue raised by my friend Elmar Brok will be considered by the Council. I feel that the criticism made of the previous presidency is not appropriate. I believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent, regardless of who was involved in that work. In any case, the question that this raises is an important one and the Council will not fail to support the proposals that the Commission has presented in this respect. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as I understood it, Mr Brok was actually referring to an earlier presidency still. Mr President, I asked Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument MEDA but he has not provided an answer. I would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us. Forgive me Mr Poos. There was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me. This is how matters stand with regard to MEDA: Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programmes, but not in the country-specific ones, because the incomes are too high. Thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday. Question Time (Council) Question No 1 by (H-0022/00): Subject: Controlling access to Community waters for oil tankers In connection with the accident involving the oil tanker ERIKA off the French coast, which produced a large oil slick, what steps does the Council intend to take to control access to Community waters for tankers flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika.	fr
The European Commission' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions. I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur, one positive and one negative. The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities. The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment. It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation. This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period. Thus, Mr President, I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as other speakers have done, to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006.   Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it. The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union' s regional policy aims. The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts. Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe. The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average, whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly. We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas. Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences, long distances, climates that are too cold or too hot, sparse populations and austere conditions? How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development? It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more remote areas. The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility. Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased. This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced. In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place. For example, uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration. In this connection, too, weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development. It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how. Our Group is in favour of adopting this report. Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union' s regional policy has, until now, not been able to interpret, in any significant way, the existing differences in our inhabitants' incomes.	de
"We were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December. An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process. That is something we do not want to see, and we have therefore voted against any such extension. We nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding. . (SV) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference. Possible future Member States ought to be involved in, and have an influence upon, the shaping of the EU of the future. The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centred upon Brussels. With the convening of the forthcoming IGC, the process of European Union is topical once again. Once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the Heads of State and Government. In other words, fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide, behind closed doors, on the fate of more than 350 million individuals. It is therefore easy to understand the public' s lack of interest, given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them. In fact, one only need look at the agenda of the IGC: the institutions, enlargement and European defence. The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power, the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe, particularly by increasing military budgets. Social Europe, used as a foil by the EU, has simply been eliminated from the agenda. All this does is to legitimise the development, on the European scale, of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers' main claims towards the highest common denominator. This is why I am voting against the report. I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the IGC. I did so because it sums up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency, which is supported by a broad majority in Parliament, of opening up the IGC agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between Member States, large and small, as was originally stated when the Helsinki Council was convened. Unfortunately, in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for revisions to the Treaty on European Union, nothing has so far been stated about the need to review Article 7, which deals with suspending a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the ""founding"" principles of the Union, as laid down in Article 6. As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated, the Union has the right to protect itself. Nevertheless, the legal mechanisms that exist in the Treaty are weak, difficult to apply politically and legally, do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance. Suspending a state is just such a process, and is to be condemned."	fr
"The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme. From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance, which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens. Yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate, if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority. The interlinking of the EU institutions, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well. Yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction? Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what' but more 'what are we doing together' ? It is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens. In your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us. I would add to these the future of our social model. This is why I and my group are so firmly insisting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The reason our timetable includes the drafting of this Charter is because we are at a key point in our history. Our Union needs to redefine the values on which it is based, both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire, but not under just any conditions. Our people expect more Europe, but not just any Europe. They are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather, on the basis of our social model, to be able to organise globalisation. In this respect I must say that, in terms of your commitment to a political union, to which we are favourable, this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model, on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I should like to start with a quote: ""The Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme. The Commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration. It wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime"" . That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security, freedom, citizens' rights and judicial cooperation. A paper this short is a farce. A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand. A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard. It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard. We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme."	el
"What is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process, which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences, should have the will and the know-how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse. It is, after all, a matter of civilisation, progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community. . (SV) The basic values common to the Member States of the European Union are based upon democracy, human freedoms and rights, and a social market economy. These values must be given expression in the form of solidarity with the weaker groups in our society and in the world around us. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is the Member States themselves which devise their own social security systems. Inhabitants of countries in the European Union ought, nonetheless, to be able to benefit from a minimum network of social protection, irrespective of which country they live in. The report seeks ""effective and ambitious fiscal coordination"" , without going on to define more specifically what this means. As we see it, such a position constitutes unduly large interference in national fiscal policy and cannot, therefore, be supported. We are therefore voting against paragraph 7 of the report. The report emphasises the social dimension of European cooperation, which is something to be welcomed. It is nonetheless important to clarify what role the EU is to play, and not to play, with regard to social security. Clarification of this kind is missing from the report, which is unfortunate. . (EL) On reading the Commission' s statement on social protection, which is animated by so many good intentions, one wonders whether its authors and the working people in Europe are living on the same continent and in the same social reality. One also wonders whether this 'coordinated modernisation strategy' is not just another misrepresentation of the coordinated and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquired rights of working people. We agree with many of the rapporteur' s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the Commission' s and the Council' s intentions and plans concerning social protection. The general lines of the implemented economic policy, the Stability Pact and the strict convergence programmes, which are a constant menace to employment and which promote employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations, and the organisation of labour, along with Commission and the ESF decisions relating to salary and wage restraint, and the insistence upon austere budgetary discipline and upon achieving much-vaunted monetary stability at all costs, leave no doubt about the new strategy' s objectives and aspirations. Its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security, and for flexibilising social protection itself. When social security has repeatedly, and in the words of many influential people, been characterised as a 'cost' and an 'obstacle' to greater competitiveness and when ways are being sought to transfer that cost from companies to working people - always, of course, on the pretext that this will create jobs - it would surprise us if the existing model of market economy without accountability, with its dismal monetary-economic approach to everything and total dependence on monopolistic interests, were to take under its protection the fundamental right of the citizens to social protection and care. Clearly, what is being attempted is to move away from organised systems of social security under state control, towards systems based on private insurance agencies, which will generate new profits for capital and place even greater burdens on working people, who besides the higher cost, will 'enjoy' even more degraded social provisions. The fostering of illicit competition between public and private social security systems and between the systems of the Member States is not only unjustifiable, but, on the contrary, makes manifest the political expediencies and intolerable pressures imposed upon social security systems to weaken or even do away with them, to the benefit of the private sector and the law of profit. It is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems. So how is it possible to speak about healthy and economically sustainable social security systems when we are faced with the millions of unemployed, impoverished and marginalised people, the 'working poor' of part-time employment, and working conditions that are dissociated from the policies implemented? Social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in Europe, and were achieved after many years of battling against the aspirations of big business, and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people. Today, in the Europe of unemployment and underemployment, it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people, but this demands a different system of economic and social development, which the EU cannot possibly create, because of its nature and character."	fi
We have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community. The European Union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role, but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were, as you have said yourself, Mrs Karamanou, not the best before the military action in Kosovo. What is more, I do not believe, Mrs Karamanou, that the military action in Kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation. The present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations, and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in Kosovo' s administration. This is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole. And if we cannot solve the political problem, which must be done in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolution, then we will not solve the problem of child health, nor the various other problems faced by this region. I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica. In cooperation with Europe, the international community rebuilt the hospital there too, but it is located in the northern part of the city, thus prohibiting access to Albanian Kosovars. This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars. This is also happening elsewhere in the country, causing tension between the Albanian Kosovars and Serbs, making for a situation where nobody trusts anybody anymore and where Albanians do not want to be looked after by Serbs and vice versa. I understand very well what you are saying and you are right: the European Union should work in a wider context of international cooperation. But where will you place the emphasis? What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital, including that in Mitrovica? Mr Staes, the situation in Mitrovica is well known. This is a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of Kosovo. I perfectly understand Mr Staes' s concerns. Nevertheless, I would like to say that Bernard Kouchner' s work in this area has aimed to comply with the objectives of the relevant United Nations resolution, in an attempt to create multi-ethnic facilities which can serve the various communities, including the various aspects of the administration. I believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible, because there are various protagonists involved. The situation in Mitrovica is appalling, and involves very special tensions, and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed. Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals.	el
A case in point is the Mediterranean, including my country' s fishing industry. After years of the CFP for the Mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid, Regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy, with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation. This is a worthy objective, the implementation of which, however, has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of Mediterranean species of fish. A subsequent regulation, Regulation 1448, adopted, not by chance, in 1999, permitted certain exemptions, in particular for special cases. The time period will elapse on 31 May next, to be precise, when the Commission will present a proposal. We hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge Italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that, from the point of view of biological implications, resources are, to some extent, sustainable. Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. Combating certain fish diseases The next item is the report A5-0036/2000 by Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93/53/EEC introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases (COM(1999) - C5-0168/1999 - 1999/0191 (CNS)). Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984, then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland. Although the virus has been found in other species, the disease itself is so far confined to salmon. The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures. The Scottish salmon-farming industry is the biggest in the EU, spread throughout some of Europe' s most peripheral communities. It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually. It is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to Scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of Europe that the disease be brought under control and, if possible, eradicated. The current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be slaughtered whether affected by the disease or not. The intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible. The reality is that the compulsory slaughter policy has failed even to contain, let alone eradicate ISA, and while failing to deliver its objectives, the present rule has had a devastating economic effect on the industry with no compensation being paid and no possibility of commercial insurance. The proposed changes are twofold: the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle. This is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at European level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine. The second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms, working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm. This approach has been used very effectively in Norway where new reports of ISA are down to a handful of cases a year having peaked at some 80-90 cases per year in the early 1990s. I therefore support the Commission' s proposed changes and I am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation. I also highlight the issue of compensation and call for the amendment of Council Decision 90/424/EEC by specifically including ISA in its appended list of diseases, thereby enabling compensation to be paid at 50% Commission, 50% Member State. I thank colleagues in the Fisheries Committee for their overwhelming vote in support of my report and I in particular thank my Scottish colleagues in the committee for their input to this whole process.	fi
What is more, the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent, so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process, now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them. I should also just like to draw Mr Dell' Alba' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of. Take a look at Jean Monet' s memoirs. What he envisaged was what he called a small, practical secretariat. That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today. Madam President, this morning the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years, laudable aims indeed, to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world: succeeding with enlargement, meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe, introducing better principles of governance. We accept that Europeans, particularly the younger generation, need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead. But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high? We need to match this vision with reality. Here there are three elements I would like to contribute. Firstly, we need a successful European economy. We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across Europe, confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation, encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet, show that e-Europe is a good initiative. But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation, stifling individual initiative and enterprise. We must not fear globalisation, but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society. Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead, particularly of enlargement. Secondly, we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity. Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too. We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation. Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to go in a different direction. We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes. Lastly, we need to ensure that there is proper, genuine reform of the European Commission. Yes, the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body, but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament. The information problem, which Mr Bonde just referred to, is treated like a straw in the wind, with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us, as citizens and as parliamentarians, although we have the right to it under the Treaties.	fr
So a great deal has to be done in this area. And what exactly should be done? Two things, and Mrs Theato' s report clearly spells these out. Firstly, the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union. So, unification in this small area. Secondly, we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor' s Office with two tasks, firstly to assist the national public prosecutors, helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and, secondly, to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision. The European Public Prosecutor' s Office is nothing to be afraid of. I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on. It is, in fact, something very positive. Just like Europol. Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces. This is exactly the task which a small, limited, European Public Prosecutor' s Office should carry out, not just at the criminal investigation stage, but also at the prosecution stage. Parliament supports this. The Committee of Wise Men supports this. I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same. Mr President, I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris. I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue. Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation. The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK. The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about. Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget. But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists, with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity. We need a public debate on this. We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed. The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed. There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date. It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate. Mr President, on behalf of the Italian Radical Members, I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control, because I share the concerns that have been voiced, in such an authoritative way, by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important: common law. With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue, since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed, to be crushed. Nevertheless, the way in which our committee intends to see this text through, with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair, Mrs Theato, will not be without its critics. Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law. Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud. Nevertheless, we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality, without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this. That is to say, they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system. We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee. Mr President, we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament, during the plenary sittings and in the committees, even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture, the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed. We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events, which in the past seemed to be the norm.	fi
For example, adapting EQUAL to the objectives of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations transforms this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts. Extending the LEADER initiative to every area in the Union entails the risk of marginalising deprived areas even more, to the benefit of more developed areas. The INTERREG initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas, islands and both mountain and non-mountain areas, such as the prefecture of Arta in Greece, whose omission from Annex I of the Commission' s communication is ill-considered. Mr President, rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area, and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible, Commissioner Fischler. Our response to rural decline has come late in the day, but I suppose better late than never. Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed, certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000. In my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms. It behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival. As the Commissioner knows, farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities. For this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development. In this regard LEADER has established itself as an effective development initiative. It provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems. The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated. Yet, through LEADER, there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy. In conclusion, while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER+, I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme. I urge you to look seriously at this problem. A break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having read the Commission communication on the INTERREG III initiative, and pointing out that I took part in the vote on Mr Decourri√®re' s report within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and, particularly in the context of INTERREG III B, with the Commission' s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of landscapes run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector, a sector in which many associations, especially cynegetic, are already making enormous investments in my own country. I should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand A of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand III C and, finally, in requesting that Members of the European Parliament should be involved in the European Observatory for cross-border, transregional and interregional cooperation. I should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which, in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B, involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000, which I think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems, from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted. Finally, if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit, I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the INTERREG projects and, beyond that, of similar initiatives. It would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of framing and implementing the programmes concerned, otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens. Mr President, there is no doubt that the INTERREG initiative promotes efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union.	fi
I voted for it, not just because I was born in a coastal town, Genoa, but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too. These frontiers stretch as far as African states and the Middle East: we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of Europe. As an MEP from a border region, I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest. We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically, socially and culturally. Due to the existence of these borders, they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong. This has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy. This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990. This programme was designed to encourage cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union. INTERREG serves principally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs, education and training, cultural exchanges, action to combat health problems, the protection and improvement of the environment, energy, transport and telecommunications networks. I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration. More active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be promoted, bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border. In cross-border cooperation, greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators. In the same respect, given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50% of all unemployment, the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment. Obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing, braking or hindering cross-border mobility. I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region! INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area. Finally, and in particular, expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTERREG! The challenges are therefore immense. The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy! I hope everyone, like Mr Decourri√®re, whom I congratulate, will realise this! - (FR) The INTERREG Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy. This apparently generous policy, officially intended to help problem regions, is a fool' s bargain for French taxpayers. France contributes 17% of the European budget yet will receive only 8% of the regional Structural Funds.	de
(The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m.) Shipwreck of the Erika The next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Commission, on the shipwreck of the Erika. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today. Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments. He must have reconsidered and, in so doing, has, as usual, shown great respect for this House. I thank him for this. On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker Erika. There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue. Firstly, we must show the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident. Secondly, we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster, namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions. The epilogue to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future. Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event. We must now get down to adopting measures, Commissioner. Firstly, efficient controls are needed in Community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport, particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved. The construction of these vessels, the use of double hulls, their age, their control by classification companies, insurance, the creation of databases containing all relevant information, Community cooperation and coordination, the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled. Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for European harmonisation in these areas? Flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport, particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling 'responsible fisheries' . Access into Community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards must be controlled. We expect concrete action from the European Commission. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of Brittany and the Vend√©e are particularly important, well-developed and prestigious. The European Commission must therefore publicise the damage caused and its assessment of this damage. It must also indicate all the specific measures, including political, economic, social and financial measures, which it intends to adopt in order to minimise the damage and compensate the fishermen and industries which have been dramatically affected overnight. How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained? How can those affected be compensated? This is a very serious problem which the European Union, as an economic, commercial, industrial and fishing power, must tackle. We must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and occupations.	fr
This initiative is to be congratulated. Unemployment and the resulting poverty and social exclusion are scourges which we must tackle head-on. The preparation of a coherent and coordinated strategy involving all the Member States is therefore essential. We must firstly set ambitious objectives. Those indicated in the Portuguese presidency' s document are the return to full employment, stable growth, a genuine process of social cohesion, equal opportunities and the fight against poverty. As underlined by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Guterres, we were able to coordinate our economic policies to launch the euro. The European Union must now accept the challenge and proceed in a similar fashion by proposing guidelines for the policy on employment and social inclusion. I also welcome the idea of setting quantified objectives and benchmarks, in particular an annual average growth rate in the EU of 3% and a level of employment of 70%. To complement this, a transparent benchmarking system must be established in order to assess the progress made by Member States in achieving these objectives. This requires an open system of paired assessment and coordination. The presidency' s document also stresses the necessary reinforcement of social convergence and the modernisation of our social protection systems. The essential condition is clearly to guarantee a high level of employment. This requires the creation of jobs, not just any jobs, but quality jobs, particularly in the service sector. It also involves keeping jobs in Europe, given that the recent trend has been mass and systematic redundancies. This means that the workforce has to adapt to the new information technologies. I therefore broadly support this programme. I hope these objectives will lead, during the Lisbon Summit, to specific and ambitious measures which can meet the legitimate expectations of the male and female citizens of Europe. - (EL) Yet another summit, this time initiated by the Portuguese presidency, is about to add its contribution to the continuing intensification of, and support for, the neo-Liberal, monetarist policies which have led to the present dismal situation, which contradict every social and employment policy and which cause dramatic rises in unemployment, job insecurity, discrimination, social exclusion and widespread poverty, ostensibly in order to 'promote' proposals and measures to support employment and combat unemployment. It is a contradiction, it is ironic, it is hypocritical and it is insulting to workers to propose strengthening the competitiveness of undertakings by reducing labour costs, promoting total liberalisation, increasing the flexibility of the job market and supporting atypical forms of work as measures to combat unemployment. We need to stop maintaining and strengthening the Stability Pact, giving priority to nominal convergence criteria, and we need to stop completely subjugating social policy to financial criteria and requirements before we can start talking about fundamental employment policies. Speculative working capital would be taxed, tax havens would be abolished, fraud and tax evasion would be combated, wealth and income would be redistributed for the benefit of labour, state aid would be controlled, restructuring, merger and relocation grants which result in mass redundancies would immediately be suspended, and better social protection based on solidarity and independent of commercial and financial interests would be introduced if employment really were the European Union's main concern, rather than how to 'sweeten the pill' in order to deceive workers and limit social reaction to its anti-labour and anti-grass roots economic and social policy. If its aim were to improve the standard of living of workers, increase their purchasing power and guarantee safe jobs, it would support public-sector and social investment and equal opportunities, combat all forms of discrimination in connection with access to employment and jobs and act as a barrier to policies based on privatisation, low wages and lack of social protection, flexible and temporary work and the constant exclusion of women, the young and people with special needs from the job market. In fact, what the economic and social policy guidelines are promoting, what they are striving for in practice, is a minimum level of poverty, not a minimum level of prosperity for workers. Prosperity is the preserve of big business, before which all bow down in reverence, making it more and more immune, throwing the job market even more out of kilter in the name of increased productivity and competitiveness, attacking social and other rights which have been won even more violently and promoting the perception that the modern (anti¬≠)social state need only throw the people a few crumbs of charity.	fi
This is the great challenge, the great importance of Lisbon. I just want to dwell on one or two key aspects that will help us realise that goal of turning rhetoric into reality. Firstly, there is the commitment to having genuine benchmarks, a genuine process of peer review, to the setting of targets, of genuine targets that we can achieve, to governments agreeing to embark upon what is quite a brave process of saying: 'yes, we will allow ourselves to be marked against each other, we will allow ourselves to be marked against the rest of the world' . That really is a brave decision, because some Member States will clearly find themselves towards the bottom of the league table, which is something nobody likes. But this is important if we are to have a genuine achievable outcome from this Lisbon Summit rather than perhaps setting off down another road - a road which I know Prime Minister Gut√≠errez does not want to embark on, because he actually wants to see something achieved in the process of the Lisbon Summit. There are other areas that we must look at. One of these is the challenge of creating an e-Europe which involves all its citizens and does not leave anybody on the wayside. Another is the process of actually having a genuine single market - which we still do not yet have - and skills training that will be the key to delivering that innovative and knowledge-driven society. There are tough choices, but once again in the gallery here tonight, I would like those people listening to this debate to take away with them the belief that we are going to actually have a society based on full employment, that the road to Lisbon will be the end of our journey, and that some concrete results will actually come out of it. I welcome the new strategic goal of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive area. Who could challenge such an ambition? I have to say, however, that dynamism and entrepreneurship as well as social cohesion are a very ambitious target, not to mention the creative tension between those two objectives. I hope that we will achieve them, but I sound a warning note. I note another ambitious objective of playing a proactive role in organising cyberspace. I cannot help thinking this is more a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted! I welcome the emphasis on bolstering research and development in Europe, on developing content industries and on speeding up broad-band networks with all that is involved as part of working towards a knowledge society. Actually, I would prefer to call it an information economy because it is the economy aspect which is the most important. We live in the time of IDEA - the Internet digital electronic age. That sums up what we are trying to achieve on the e-side, the electronic side, of life. But I welcome the fact that this summit is aiming also at a wider emphasis on reforms of our economies in Europe to improve competitiveness and innovation. That must be right. We cannot just focus on the new economy. We must pay attention to the old. I look forward to hearing more detail about the European Charter for micro-enterprises - that should be very interesting when it comes forward. One of the priorities which has been identified under the Cardiff process is to improve the sensitivity of the financial markets to the value of intangible investments and investments in knowledge. That has been achieved possibly beyond the wildest dreams of people a few months ago. It can be seen in the phenomenal growth in the stock markets of Europe in the value of dot.com companies and just recently in the major changes in the composition of the FTSE 100 index in London. I cannot help thinking however that although these values have gone sky high and we may expect the bubble to burst, nevertheless the underlying structural change in our economies is here to stay. Mr President-in-Office, you have made us in the European Parliament eager to leave for Lisbon already. All of us can only hope that the Special Summit is able to live up to the high expectations which people have of it. Because, as you have already stressed, we do not need one more process after another, one procedure after another; rather we need action by which the people of the European Union can measure the benefits and added value of what the European Union does.	fi
Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do. I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked, that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union. I have good reason for asking this. As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence. How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time, for example by our partners in the USA, on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes? How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you? That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner! Mr President, I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons. I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts, for example with the United States. We should not be so na√Øve as to think otherwise. Ever since we signed this protocol in Montreal, we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment, health and trade. This constitutes a good example, therefore. We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too, but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily. We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle, and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it, something which is clearly established in the present communication. Thank you, Commissioner. The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed, so to speak, as more than an ordinary aspect of administration, even though, as we have been able to establish from the interventions, questions and replies, it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance. The debate is closed. Intergovernmental Conference The next item is the report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference [14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)]. Mr President, I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts. Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration. The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement. The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century. For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively, more democratically and with complete transparency, clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work. The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work. From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit, it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe, one that is more effective, more democratic and more transparent.	de
"As far as the Commission is concerned, it will, ladies and gentlemen, be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate. Cross-border services - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today, but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do. I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative, and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today. It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis. The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees, I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst. These have, in fact, clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits. However, the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue. Furthermore, not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice' s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement, and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services; barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for the smaller companies. The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services. There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here. Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises. It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement. All provisions, i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights, should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services. I, together with the European Parliament' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view, as expressed in the report produced by the Council' s Legal Service, is inappropriate. Consequently, I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned. I also believe that Parliament' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission' s proposal. Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the Council, and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense. When it comes to acceptance by the Council, I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible, even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals. I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis. Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments, one of the essential differences is that, in place of a ""service provision card plus notification for each individual contract"" system, provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract."	de
"As for your question about Austria, I would like to repeat what I said about Austria' s compliance with Articles 6 and 7 up to now. It was good to hear you talking about an ""ad hoc decision"" as it is clear that this was an ad hoc decision, and one taken by the 14 Member States regarding their relations with the Austrian Government. What was at issue was not the Austrian Government' s conduct, but its political make-up. During an earlier debate I said that we are now all Austrians within the European Union, and I would like to repeat that. We are all Austrians because the European Union is a single entity in terms of rights and citizenship, and I would like to have the same rights in Austria that Austrian citizens should have in my country. So I do not like to be taught any lessons by a party which behaves in a racist and xenophobic way, and makes racist and xenophobic statements which it seems to me give us every reason to be concerned. These concerns are at present being expressed in a bilateral political framework rather than at European Union level, because there would only be scope for a decision at European Union level if there were an infringement of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which means that, for the future, Mr R√ºbig, we will have to assess to what extent the Austrian Freedom Party can make a break with its past ideology, because that is crucial. It is important for the Freedom Party to clarify if it is still adhering to the principles described in its previous statements, and in particular the kinds of individuals through which those statements were made, because otherwise I cannot see any other solution except for the other Member States to continue to have the same kinds of reservations about their relations with the Austrian Government, with all the consequences that flow from that. And, as I said, this would be a purely bilateral matter. The Austrians have every right to whatever government they want - but we have every right to our opinions about the Austrian Government. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said that there is a party in power in Austria which has made racist comments in public. Here in the European Parliament, people speak, not parties. In your reply to Mr Dupuis' question, you referred to the fact that the sanctions approved by the Heads of State and Governments of fourteen countries were bilateral in nature. Can these sanctions also be stopped bilaterally? In other words, can an individual Member State decide to end the sanctions and resume normal working relations? If so, when will the Council officially release the citizens of Austria from this ordeal, which violates their democratic rights? Must each Member State individually abandon the sanctions before the Council comes to its senses and overturns the decision? I think Mrs Kauppi must have misheard or there must have been a mistake in the interpreting."	el
"But tomorrow will be too late. We have to lay down the rules of play today, before we all lose. In adopting the water directive on Wednesday 15 February, the European Parliament confirmed its wish to protect surface water, coastal wasters, inland waters and groundwater. Europe now has a framework which will allow it to prevent any deterioration in the quality of water, promote its sustainable use, protect eco-systems, help fight floods and droughts and eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances. We have thrown water a life-belt. . (FR) It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy. The ecological disaster on the banks of the Danube is a reminder, as if we needed one, that all too often human negligence jeopardises natural resources such as water. The objective of this proposal for a directive, which dates back to 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water, coastal waters, inland waters and groundwater. It provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration, protect ecosystems, promote sustainable water use, help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances. Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework. The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy. The proposal for a directive was amended twice, first in 1997 and then in 1998. A technical working party made up of Council and Parliament representatives met in January 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions. However, the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments, most of which I support. As far as the timetable and objectives are concerned, the Council' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive, while the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years. The committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020, the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020. The Council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years, but the Commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years. All the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years, not 16. I must say that I support these reduced deadlines, especially as provision is made for derogations. As far as costs are concerned, I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources. I likewise expect the European Commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012. I will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, which needs no further comment: ""Water is not a commercial product like any other but, rather, a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the European Union and which must be protected, defended and treated as such"" ."	el
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future. My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs. You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand. What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and, in particular, a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs, because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns, the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians. The politics of closed doors and private discussions; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all. That is why we need transparency. I believe it falls to you, as President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before, leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties. We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going, and its outcome, rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent. We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future. In this way, Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy. There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to. As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I wish to make the following point clear: neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter. After all, what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals? No, to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union. The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone. What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union. Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year. Of course, we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States. We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform, as the Council has resolved to do, and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny.	el
"To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds. For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States. For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level. There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission' s attention. Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided. Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds. This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain. I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern. Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular. But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them. The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability. That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide. I would like to explain our thinking here. Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds. Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as ""value for money"" indicators in the grant-giving process. Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period. But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful."	el
I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead, partially at least, to exclusion. I do not see how you could, with the views that you hold, provide any answers. What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following: what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on, for example, the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion, the division of work and social security, the implementation of tax policies, particularly for speculative capital, and the policy of redistributing wealth? I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters. You must understand that a presidency' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited. I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission' s own scope for intervening, through its right of initiative. I have spoken about the Special European Council and about Portugal' s initiative in convening it, and I have spoken about the future, because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion. One of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion. The second is to create internationally competitive conditions, which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union, and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion. The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can, in six months, resolve problems that have always existed. It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence. It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented, specifically by non-governmental organisations, but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters. We should, however, also bear in mind, Mr Papayannakis, that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact, armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months. We therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies, regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term, some of the homeless may be dead, will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union. We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency. Question No 12 by (H-0801/99): Subject: Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy, the Convention of Lom√© and tackling famine situations? I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question, and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position. But there are some questions still outstanding. There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme.	de
I think that, as politicians in the Council, the Commission and Parliament, we owe it to those who fall victim to increasing organised crime to create the instruments needed to fight organised crime efficiently. Mr President, for a long time, cigarette smuggling has had a rather romantic appeal in Italy, which it acquired particularly after the war thanks to the influence of neorealist films. However, the events taking place in Puglia and the South of Italy are not at all romantic. Quite the opposite. The tragic death of two customs and excise officers is a European issue as well as a question of Italian public safety, and it is not just a question of European safety, but also, and above all, an issue which has a bearing on our relations with our neighbours across the Adriatic. The European Union is making a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of the former Yugoslavia. The actions of the local authorities and our initiatives to assist them are absolutely vital elements in the fight against organised crime, and are therefore also crucial for the safety of Europeans. We regret that the joint resolution did not take up our suggestion to make the new reconstruction programmes conditional upon an undertaking by the governments of the former Yugoslavia to cooperate actively in the fight against organised crime. However, we hope that the Council and the Commission will be able to mobilise these governments through their endeavours and that an effective action of this kind will be instigated at the Conference scheduled for 19 and 20 May, in which both institutions are to take part. Mr President, the Tampere Summit last year took note of the extremely difficult situation of some of the regions of Europe, and set the date for the forthcoming Conference of 19 and 20 May next which is on the very subject of the security and development of this area. Europe is attempting to enlarge its borders and create an area of freedom, security and justice. The Adriatic is a border and so is the Ionian Sea. If we want to give weight to the processes of European enlargement, we must reassure our citizens, our fellow citizens who live in those areas, that our words are not just hot air but authentic projects which will genuinely affect their situation, and that, when we talk of law and security, we will provide them with the necessary means, conditions and systems. We have already paid too high a price in deaths - too many civilians gave their lives in the raids in Puglia - and we have lost too many men from the forces of law and order. In consideration also of the existence of the Stability Pact, we need to take practical steps to show that the enlargement of Europe will also mean greater security for our people. Mr President, when it comes to this issue, I am in two minds. On the one hand, it is only natural - and I was the rapporteur for enlargement to the east and internal security - that we need to worry about higher security standards, not only in the candidate countries, as we do in the EU itself, but of course in all other European countries. We need a pan-European system of internal security, and here the Balkans are naturally a special cause for concern because we have assumed responsibility in Kosovo and the neighbouring regions.	el
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts. Moreover, I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor Tesauro, Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority, sent me, and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration. Our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market, and, above all, to achieve consistency between the different national markets. As things stand, there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English, Italian and French markets. There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy. Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement, which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment. In my opinion, we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed: small and medium-sized businesses, which bind the European economy together, and social protection, which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy. Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade, pure and simple, and a system for improving people' s quality of life. A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected. We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral. I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed. Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force. A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition, marked by clear, uniform rules. In his report, Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well. But Europe is changing. The economies are growing, we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States. The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy. It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy. This is not in question. Having said this, I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation. How will the Commission, as keeper of the Treaties, guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London, Palermo, Helsinki and, soon, Budapest and Ankara? This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented, and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given. It is not enough to say that, in the Member States, there is already 40 years' worth of experience. In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy. This country has a very small market which, unfortunately, is often at the same time defined as the relevant market. This in contrast to Germany, where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market. The European Commission' s belief that, in all quarters of the Union, legislation will, almost as a matter of course, be interpreted in the same way, is what, within catholic circles, we term ""foolhardy,"" and this is not allowed."	de
It has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities, the non-governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration. The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them, while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups. We can therefore welcome its adoption. We must, however, admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory! The total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge. The amount for the 1994-1999 period was EUR 900 million and will be EUR 700 million for the 2000-2006 period. This represents a drop of 30%! This reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new URBAN initiative. The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low. It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States. In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects, the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect. The McCarthy report on the URBAN Community Initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in urban matters. The situation of certain urban areas is alarming, with the social distress taking the form of unemployment, misery and crime. Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency. Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt. Subsidiarity should make us realise that the state, exercising its governing functions, and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately. The state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people. Although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchanges between successful enterprises, the problems specific to each urban area cannot be dealt with in the same way. The URBAN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union' s desire to communitise urban policy. It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-existing European policies. Clearly some people are profiting from the opportunity to indulge in another budget bidding race which is particularly mistimed when the convergence criteria for EMU are imposing a very strict slimming regime on the national budgets. Mrs McCarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extolling the benefits of a federal Europe. We should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project. In fact, the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted. The aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility. Finally, the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or sociological minorities. We can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion.	el
You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks. Could you please give an answer on this issue? You are concerned about whether the Structural Funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere. Quite simply there is no question of this. I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation. As a result, the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected. However, you are right to question me as this is your task, as mine is to answer you. As has happened in the past, the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification. I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point. The Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible. I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks. The energy situation varies widely from region to region in the European Union. Assistance from the Structural Funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions, particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped. This is the only answer I can give you on the link between large-scale energy transmission networks and the Structural Funds. Question No 46 by (H-0052/00):  Subject: Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality, I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality. In particular, would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States, with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries? Mr MacCormick, the Commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated, for the 2000-2006 period, in Article 11 of the general Regulation on the Funds. As in the past, these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State. In this respect, it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional. The cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure. Provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected. As for the budgetary provisions within the Member States, between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries, these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules.	el
"I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States. We already have, on the international side, plans in place to combat drug trafficking, money laundering and so on. But to bring it down to a more human level: to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs, and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation; secondly, to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws; thirdly, to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of ""normalisation"" and ""harm reduction"" and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people. Mr President, I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out, or remind, the representative of the Commission that, in Belgium, the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence, right to be reunited with their families, etc. This is a Belgian government measure which flies in the face of the Schengen Treaty. I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December. I would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me, within the foreseeable future, of the steps the Commission will take to penalise this violation of the Schengen Treaty by the Belgian State, in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty. Mr President, esteemed gentlemen from Portugal, especially the Council representatives, you face great expectations on our part. I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment. I refer to Eurodac. You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system, as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications, in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and, above all, in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure. We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument, together with an implementation committee, which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be. We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality. Even in Tampere, we were of the opinion that Eurodac was becoming a reality. However, the Council then took another direction at the very next summit in December and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected, i.e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation, that the regulatory committee would be attached to the Council and that, where possible, Gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure."	fr
We therefore feel that you acted correctly in sending a message and that perhaps those who protested about it are still feeling the effects of Bolshevism or Nazism. Democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong, but also listening to their explanations. Enlargement - and Alleanza Nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this House - must not mean dilution, that is, it must not entail more risks. The applicant countries' hopes are at least as important as the hopes of our current fellow citizens, who are beginning to feel bitterly disappointed by the way Europe works, as it is not resolving the most serious problems. We therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be redrafted with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in Romania, reaching as far as Belgrade, but above all, the continuing spread of apathy as regards major security issues. Even today, we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics. We therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement, so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions, with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur. I would also like to say a few words on Africa, Madam President. The third and fourth worlds have been abandoned: just one dollar, one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children. Europe, which is so democratic, so progressive, does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board, while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases. One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation. Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification, just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm. The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few. As for the Internet, Europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules. On a personal note, please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who, by acting the way they are, are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated. We live in a world of rules and regulations: let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future. Madam President, as a Padanian taxpayer, I have already experienced the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Prodi, since Padania is liable to Italy for its taxes as well. Listening to him just now, I was concerned when he mentioned new resources, something that readily translates as additional taxation, in view, inter alia, of enlargement, that is the entry of new States into the Union. But why do they not buy their own entrance ticket? My Padanian electorate who, thanks to Mr Prodi, have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention, thanks once again to Mr Prodi, of paying another tax for someone else.	el
I would say to the Portuguese minister that I completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power. That is absolutely crucial. It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women. Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children. Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today. Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves. What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides' surrendering power. The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden. Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark. And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark. In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland. We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing. I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources. It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term. In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated. The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures. One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments. I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures. In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up. There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally. The first is the issue of the media' s influence. I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish. Do we have a special problem in this regard? I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question. I have a suspicion that this is the case, but I am not certain. The second point is the enlargement of the Union. I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned.	el
Unfortunately, nothing is changing and nothing is going to change. You intend to pour oil on the fire and apply the same ill-advised methods and the same economic principles to areas which have, until now, escaped your grasp: education, wage policy, direct taxation, employment law, social protection, social assistance. The most extraordinary thing in all this is that this socially regressive policy has in the main been implemented by left wing governments of varying hues - pink, red, green - who advocate social justice during electoral campaigns, but orchestrate widespread social decline once in power. I must at this point stress our conviction that there can be no social policy nor full employment policy without national and European preferences, and without protecting our markets from fierce international competition. It is our obligation to put Europeans first when it comes to employment, social protection, policies relating to the family, and retirement policy. Your globalisation of the economy is neither necessary nor inevitable. This globalisation has been forcibly imposed by the only superpower to have survived the cold war and by multinational companies which are becoming economic superpowers in their own right and who can subjugate to their economic will states, nations and peoples who are quite unable to protect themselves. You are thus acting as accomplices in this process. You are facilitating it, collaborating with it, and are in fact orchestrating, despite your declared intentions, the disintegration of our social welfare systems, precariousness, and social decline. The European social model runs the risk of not being able to cater for this globalisation of the economy, especially in its current form which operates with no regard for specific social issues nor the specific national characteristics of individual States. Your ultra-liberal headlong rush is thus surely not the solution to social problems, precariousness or employment problems faced by tens of millions of European citizens. Mr President, the Lisbon Summit will produce a further string of fine words to dazzle us with. The words will be welcome, but the basic problem is that we have an Economic and Monetary Union which attaches more importance to fighting inflation than to promoting employment. The Central Bank has said that price rises should always be kept below 2%. The Stability Pact says that the budget deficit must be no more than 1% in ordinary years. There is no requirement that unemployment should be below 5% or - better still - below 2 or 1%. It is public consumption and the price of money which definitely must not rise. You might think that a country would wish to limit unemployment by means of public investment, but that is prohibited. It is more important to stick to the holy cow of monetary policy than to find jobs for the unemployed. I, on the other hand, think it is more important to take account of families' finances and to ensure that dad comes home with a wage packet instead of a redundancy notice. So too did the Danish Government which came to power in 1993. In 1992 we had 9.2% unemployment, both in Denmark and in the eleven countries of the good old EU. Between 1992 and 1998, unemployment in Denmark fell to 5.1%. In the EU, it increased to 10.9%.	de
I will give you one example of this. In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million. It is clear that is not acceptable. What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation? We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit. We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working. But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated. We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March. We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones. The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history. We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves. Our own staff policy is outdated. Some of our working practices need radical reform. I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process. We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting. We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities. Finally, can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public. European taxpayers need to be re-assured. The fate of the Commission, of the whole European Union, rests on delivery of this reform. That is the key issue, delivery of these proposals. Mr President, I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, on his first report. I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments. I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run. We have submitted an amendment to this effect. From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report, I would like to highlight a few, not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly. Firstly, I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents. The Commission' s records leave a great deal to be desired. We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair, which, as it happens, has still not been sorted out. Curiously, very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets, even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General, and this is clearly something which should not happen.	fr
The discrepancies or inconsistencies which might result from various ideologically informed views can be seen in the position of the Committee on Women' s Rights which is calling, for example, for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to contain a clause banning discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation but maintains that family rights as such do not exist. We need to be wary of perhaps well-meant, generous proposals if we want to prevent decision processes in the EU being crippled by a plethora of recourse proceedings which would mean more than doubling the number of judges at the European Court of Justice, and nobody would know where to enforce their basic rights any more or how long they must wait for a judgement. - (SV) We welcome the work which has now begun on preparing an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. A Charter of this kind will have a very important symbolic value and will strengthen the confidence of our citizens in the EU and in European integration. The Charter of Fundamental Rights should be seen as complementing the European Convention on Human Rights, which we believe should be incorporated into the Treaty. The Charter should concentrate on the relationship between citizens and the European institutions. Its primary objective should be to guarantee that the Union is governed openly. The Charter should be legally binding through its also being incorporated into the EU' s Treaty. The Charter must not only be a declaration, but also entail obligations of some kind on the part of the EU' s institutions and Member States. We would emphasise the subsidiarity principle and the fact that the Charter should concentrate on the fundamental freedoms and rights of citizens, as presented in accordance with the Member States' common constitutional traditions. We would emphasise the importance of the social dimension in the EU' s activities but consider that social policy is mainly a question for each individual Member State to decide upon. - (FR) The Charter of Fundamental Rights is the latest manifestation of the drift of Community legislation towards a constitution. In fact, the significance of this document is obvious if it is regarded as a potential preamble to a European constitution; conversely, it would be redundant in those Member States that already include these rights in their own constitution and legal traditions and confirm them by ratifying international texts such as the European Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is easy enough to think of ways to improve the application of the existing texts; but the technocratic nature of the process of European integration becomes quite obvious again today from the decision to draft an additional document, which could hardly be anything but repetitive. Yet what worries me most is the content that is to be given to these rights. Indeed, at this same part-session we are discussing reports by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms which reflect a libertarian vision of society. Their aim is not so much to defend and promote human rights as to make a clean sweep of all the points of reference on which our societies are founded and replace them with an individualist jumble 'with neither lord nor master' . This kind of Europe is based on a new totalitarianism in which man finds himself alone facing a Community administration that is as remote as it is impersonal, in which the intermediate structures - and in particular the most vital one of all, the family - have been gradually destroyed. Our society will no longer have a common destiny; instead it will be based on a juxtaposition of 'minorities' which each have their own rights but no common obligation. The conclusion I draw from these texts is that the just fight for human rights has become the ideological plaything of irresponsible and selfish individuals. What they are proposing to us today spells the death of the common good and, over and above that, of the very meaning of life; for they are concerned only with human rights and have forgotten what man is first and foremost, and what his roots and aspirations are. - British Labour Members fully support a Charter of Fundamental Rights which makes visible citizens' rights across the EU. However, we are at a very early stage in the process of determining the Charter. It is therefore too early to say what should be legally binding. This decision will be made at a later stage as recognised by the report itself in Paragraph 6. That Paragraph also states that any legally binding status recognises that Fundamental Rights are indivisible by making the Charter applicable to all the European Union's institutions and bodies and all its policies.	fi
Basically, these proposals introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States, a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits. The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there. According to the terms of the directive, the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned. Logically, in order to be given such a card, the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme. The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals. While, basically, I subscribe to the European Commission proposals, nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion. That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur. This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading! Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures, for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards. I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions. I can, therefore, only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended. We could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union had to face so many problems. This goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union. Marinho Report (A5-0003/2000): We have serious reservations about the Council' s proposed amendments. How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is overstretched? The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter. Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim, but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them: On 1 January 1995, the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994. In May 1995, during the preparatory phase of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the CFI, concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases, was already insisting on the need to take measures 'without which the Court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role ... in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial.' So what was done at Amsterdam? In that respect, nothing.	el
This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security. We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General. At the moment, our control system is completely centralised; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system. This means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice, decentralisation in every Directorate-General of the entire chain, that is of programmes, undertakings, contracts, expenditure and the related ex ante control systems, and an external auditing service which will direct these operations. This is a complete revolution of the Commission' s way of working; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking. We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage, and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place. In fact, the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world. We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology. We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration. The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper, and so we are going to become a paperless Commission. This will make the Commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the Commission. This is not just a technical revolution, but a complete organisational revolution as well. I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform, but I would first like to thank him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise. We would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the Commission staff, who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission. I would stress that this style of debate is something very new and, in my opinion, it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well. The White Paper before us is also the product of contributions from the Commission staff: they knew that the Commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become, once again, that internationally-admired institution which was at the heart of European history. The adoption of the White Paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and I hope that it will remain closed forever. Now we can focus on the future, on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005, the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks. The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan. We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission, a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions. This is why we are redefining all our work priorities. This is why we are offloading all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	de
As you know, at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year, the United States decided, at a very late stage, to table a draft resolution on China. This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no-action motion. The European Union voted against that motion. The European Union' s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China, but an EU vote against the no-action motion. It is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote. The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution. This initiative has provoked a strong reaction on China' s part: the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union, in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States' initiative. This initiative is being discussed within the Union, but with no hope of a decision in the near future. It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible, and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000. In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission, we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close. It is therefore important this year, too, that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution. In this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. The European Union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party, the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground, and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission, potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing. The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues, and whether or not it agrees with this initiative, this is in any case legitimate from this point of view. The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon, and will include seminars on legal issues and on women' s rights, and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part. The next human rights seminar will be organised by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000, and, during the last round of the dialogue in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the European Union' s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the United Nations International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the United Nations' International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, both of which have been signed by the Chinese Government.	de
"There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters, they are the result of fate. They are the result of human thoughtlessness. What we have here is an ecological disaster. Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that. It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, people who make a living from the salt marshes, shopkeepers, etc. The Erika disaster must be the last in the series. First of all, we must shed some light on this shipwreck. Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission? Next, as a matter of urgency, we muss pass legislation, firstly, regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported. In fact, according to the experts, the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast. We know what actually happened. Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old. We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea. This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium. Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the ""polluter pays"" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate ""natural disasters"" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds. I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group. Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning. It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time. We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice. These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things. No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances. This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation. However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that. In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system. Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response. Many thanks for this. This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today. The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best."	de
Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant. In a world where surely less regulation is the key, we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union, untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens. We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them. Take a large successful business, add European regulations, and within months you have created a small one. Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here. Mr President, I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today. In this respect, I share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s view that we cannot talk about these in detail. But maybe next time, we ought to discuss CORUS, the merger which has now taken place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel. I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the European Union and policy in other fields. In this light, I am pleased that Mr Liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion, where the interests of employees are concerned, with Mrs Diamantopoulou but we can involve the Commissioners who are active in other fields. I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission' s policy from these different vantage points, unlike my predecessor, who holds the belief that there is no need for rules. We need to gain an insight into what companies are like now. At present, we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition. What remains of the concept of what a company should be like now is naturally very relevant: whether it is merely the property and toy of shareholders, or whether it is a more broadly based stakeholder society, which is meant to guarantee continuity for staff, consumers, suppliers and the local population and has, in addition, a social function. As such, I would like to ask these various Commission directorates and these various Commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments. I think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in Europe, as company policy forms part of this. The government is talking to trade union and Goodyear delegates in Italy as well, in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopted by the North American multinational in Cisterna di Latina, an area of Central Italy which has already been affected by other restructuring operations. The closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty. The Goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight, in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the Goodyear workers in the different European countries as well, and there are many of them: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia. Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits. The European Union, in all of its aspects, must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes. Mr President, earlier this week President Prodi announced that one of the Commission' s strategic objectives for the next five years would be to aim for full employment.	fi
"Therefore, the first thing we have to do is suitably develop the corresponding routes. Of course, all of this is linked to our society and its development. However, I believe that we cannot limit that development; which does not mean that we do not have to make every possible effort to ensure that this development respects the environment as far as possible, with the least possible effect on that environment, especially in sensitive areas such as the Alps and the Pyrenees. Mr President, I would expressly like to thank the Commissioner for the great sensitivity she has shown so far in her handling of the Brenner traffic and Brenner base tunnel issues, and I particularly appreciate the fact that mention has repeatedly been made of the need to give special consideration to the environmental implications. I would point out that the alternative project ATT3 - and I would like to thank Commissioner Kinnock and the chairman, Mr Coleman, for their efforts here - has been examined closely and in great detail by the Commission over the past two years, and I have also received a written report on this. I would just like to add that the question from Mr Messner goes like this: ""in the event that a new installation is to be built, the project that is the most and least environmentally friendly is to be examined"" . It is completely beyond me as to why anyone should ask the Commission to make sure that something is as harmful to the environment as it possibly could be. This is all about people living in a sensitive area who must be protected. The fact that this request came from the Greens makes it all the more baffling, and it should be thrown out for this reason. The Brenner project is one of 14 projects involving trans-European transport connections and, of course, the Commission will continue to support this project, although, at the end of the day, it is the Member States which must develop it. Thank you very much, Commissioner. Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 64 to 114 will be replied to in writing. That concludes Questions to the Commission. (The sitting was suspended at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.) Eco-label The next item is the recommendation for second reading on behalf of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on a revised Community eco-label award scheme (C5-0223/1999 - 1996/0312(COD)). Mr President, as you just said, this is the second reading for the directive on the awarding of the eco-label. The European eco-label is, it has to be said, a product of the internal market. Its function, partly in response to the increasing flow of products across borders, is to label products and services which have a high level of environmental compatibility. Its function, on the one hand, is to provide information to consumers from one country to the next and, on the other, to increase awareness within industry and among citizens to recognise and promote environmental issues. And this is of major importance when it comes to the daily shopping trip. I am of the opinion that the meaningfulness of a European label which is tailored to the European internal market is beyond dispute. However, it is often a long road from the conception of a good idea to its practical implementation. This is precisely the case with the eco-label whose main claim to fame at present is, unfortunately, its virtual anonymity in most States. I think that only a very small minority of citizens have ever actually seen it and for this reason my report has paid greatest attention to the wholly inadequate preparations for the label. What are the weaknesses in the current eco-label regulation which have given rise to today' s unsatisfactory situation? I think that a key problem lies in the cost structure of the label. The test procedures which companies and their products must go through in order to obtain the label are long and costly. We are therefore advocating that the stipulation of testing requirements should look to keep test costs to an absolute minimum, although this must obviously not be misinterpreted as a qualitative watering down of testing requirements. As well as the cost of test procedures, the on-going fees which must be paid to the European eco-label system are also highly significant."	fi
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, to thank the speakers and, of course, to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure, who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result. I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council. SAVE The next item is the report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD)). Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round, which is not always the case. I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form. The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there. I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading. I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments, including a re-instatement of the Commission' s original budget. The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable. During the procedure, agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise, implement, complement and assess the Community measures. Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and, very importantly, the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency. I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress. The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council' s very meagre opening offer. In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount. We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under. This was an important consideration for us. I would like to say however that it is, and has always been, a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real. Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States. We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme. If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level, this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action, including Community actions, on energy saving.	el
"This is a recognisable aim which British Labour Members would support. As the final Charter text is not available, we are supporting the Charter in principle but awaiting the final version. This is a complex process which needs clarity and precision at all stages to ensure that the end result is a positive and visible step forward for people in all EU countries.  Our abstention on this report on the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights derives primarily from our view that it might be part of some federalist rationale which we oppose, and which could find clear and definitive expression in providing the European Union with a constitution, as proclaimed in the report, with this Charter as an important component. At the same time, as we agree with many of the rights targeted for inclusion in the Charter which, by the way, are part of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, we decided we could not vote against the report, although we do think the set of rights under consideration could and should unequivocally include the social domain, as would be ensured by approval of the amendments tabled along those lines by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left. - (DA) The European Union rests upon fundamental principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. If, however, I have misgivings about introducing a new set of human rights into the EU Treaties, this has to do with the confusing signals which would in that way be sent out and with the fear that existing instruments which are operating well would be put at risk. In my view, a declaration would be more appropriate. The European Convention on Human Rights is an excellent tool for protecting human rights in Europe. It involves enforcing these rights on the basis of judgements given by the Court of Human Rights, which has developed considerable expertise in this area, as well as extensive case law. The Convention also has the advantage of not being limited in scope to the area of the EU but of operating in relation to almost the whole of the European continent. At the same time, it is the European Court of Justice' s practice to take account of the national fundamental rights applicable in the Member States. This practice could be affected if the EU were to obtain its own set of fundamental and human rights. Jackson resolution (B5-0227/2000) My Group voted in favour of the Jackson resolution on Structural Funds in the environment because we believe in the principle of ensuring effective implementation of environmental law - in this case, the wild birds and habitats directive. However, we are surprised that Members of this House voted for the original proposal in paragraph 7 to cut off funds to some of our poorest regions in the EU. Indeed, the Commissioner, in a response to the debate, said she would not be stopping approval of key funding programmes. Members of the Environment Committee clearly cannot be aware of the undue delays that any non-approval of Structural Funds programmes would create, nor indeed of the new budgetary procedure that could involve not only delays but the loss of millions in funds in the case of the UK to Merseyside, South Yorkshire, the Highlands and Islands, Northern Ireland, Cornwall and the Isle of Wight. These are vital life-line funds for jobs and growth. I therefore welcome the fact that this House voted by a majority against cutting off resources. The Commissioner would, in any case, have had no legal competence to stop approval and therefore I am glad that, at the end of the day, common sense has prevailed in our vote. - (DE) It would appear that Community environmental protection does not have its own lobby at the Community institutions. There is no other explanation as to why the Commission gave way yesterday and suddenly decided to reinterpret the Structural Funds regulation. Having given itself real teeth last year and called in notifications of FFH areas for the joint ""Natura 2000"" project which had been overdue for years, the Commission has now tripped itself up by accepting that notifications can be submitted ex-post. That was unnecessary in that the regulation fully covered the Commission' s demand for FFH lists to be submitted together with the plans at the latest and per se leaves the Commission no room for manoeuvre here."	fi
In my view, there are at present two main problems connected with the Geneva Conventions. First of all, there is a gulf between the principles and their observance and, secondly, there are crucial states of affairs which are not covered by the conventions. Allow me to illustrate the constantly widening gulf that exists between, on the one hand, the principles contained in the conventions and, on the other hand, current observance of these by pointing out that, in conflicts in the course of the last decade, 10 times as many civilians have been killed as soldiers. That is essentially the reverse of the situation during the First World War. The widening gulf between principles and practice is due, in my opinion, to the fact that the character of wars has changed during the last 50 years. More and more wars are fought under conditions of anarchy in which there are no stable structures and in which the areas hit by war are not controlled by any government. The world has also witnessed a growing number of wars in which weapons have deliberately been aimed at civilians and the purpose of which has been to annihilate specific groups in society. In these situations, humanitarian aid to victims is naturally unwelcome, and this leaves the world in a terrible dilemma. The second problem is that the Geneva Conventions do not adequately deal with the activities of those who intervene for humanitarian reasons. Even though the Geneva Conventions contain provisions concerning the right to provide humanitarian aid in crisis situations, it is also laid down that this right requires the consent of the government in the country concerned. This is especially the case if it is a question of internal conflicts. The principle of humanitarian access or the international community' s right to protect, and provide aid to, those in distress if a State is unable - or unwilling - to do so itself is not, therefore, being universally applied. This is a serious breach of the humanitarian principle and is, in some cases, a fatal shortcoming which is responsible for many war victims. It was precisely this question of providing normal access to humanitarian organisations that was the focal point of my visit to Chechnya at the beginning of February. In my view, the question of to what extent circumstances require a revision of the Geneva Conventions, and what form this should take, is now an important one. I believe we have two options which are not mutually exclusive. The first is to change the conventions so that they are better placed to tackle complex contemporary crises, for example by establishing the right to provide humanitarian aid to those in need. The other option is to ensure that the humanitarian principles established in the Geneva Conventions are in actual fact observed, for example, by improving the mechanisms for enforcing them. The first option - that of reconsidering the content of the conventions in order to close all the loopholes - is a complicated and risky option: complicated because the way in which war is conducted is constantly changing, and risky because the possibility cannot be excluded that, as a result of opening the conventions to renegotiation, no new agreement might be reached. But allow me to say clearly that I am wholeheartedly in favour of establishing the principle of humanitarian access in all situations and of reinforcing the right of those in distress to receive humanitarian aid. With regard to the other option - that of securing better observance of the existing principles - I think that prosecuting offenders is one of the most promising options to be pursued. The obligation upon States to proceed against war criminals is established in the Geneva Conventions, but that is clearly not enough. I therefore wholeheartedly support the demand for prompt ratification of the statute of the International Criminal Court. This demand has also been put forward here today. On behalf of the Commission, I want to give my support to the view that we ought to work together on bringing this task to a satisfactory conclusion and turning it into legal reality.	fi
As you will know, the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50% by 2015, by increasing compulsory schooling, by significantly reducing child mortality rates, and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective. This would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world' s population lives, and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively. And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise. Particularly in recent years, development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter, and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership. The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here, as has the Bretton Woods system. I have in mind, in particular, the important impetus given to this debate by the World Bank, especially through its Comprehensive Framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund, where, for the first time, an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto unimaginable link, for a body of this type, between debt relief and poverty. This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context. The Portuguese Presidency has highlighted the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies, and to create greater scope for coordination, in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system. If we are to strengthen the European Union' s role in international development policies, we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action. Firstly, we need to make the EU' s development policy more effective. As you know, an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies, and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency. The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues. The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies, the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union' s present cooperation policies, the need to make the EU' s aid management more efficient and, in particular, to review its mechanisms for intervention, and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid. A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more.	fr
The reason she cannot do so is because, as some honourable Members have pointed out, she is in Hungary and Romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to tackle the crisis. We stand ready to do so. We contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently. The Romanians have approached UNEF and OCHA, in Geneva, for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts. We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed. That is obviously crucial. It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it. It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged. There is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the Romanian authorities. This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested. The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy. It is mirrored in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be applied in this case. The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due. The Union has mobilised some EUR 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the Danube River basin. In the context of pre-accession aid to the region it may be possible to redirect some of the assistance we are giving under ISPAR and PHARE to tackle the most severe impact of this accident, as long as the polluter-pays principle is fully respected. We will want, in the longer term, to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster, above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place. The incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of European civil protection, along the lines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two Members today. But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis. As I have said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallstr√∂m, is on the spot today. She will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit. This has been an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future. The debate is closed. We shall now proceed to the vote. VOTE . (FR) The only reason we voted for the PSE-Verts/ALE-GUE/NGL compromise motion for a resolution is because this resolution allowed us to condemn the decision by the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its factory in Italy.	fr
How can a universal service provider in my country survive with the liberalisation of cross-border mail which amounts to approximately 25%, as opposed to less than 5% in other countries? How are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office' s business abroad? We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject. It will most certainly be necessary, we say, because of the technological developments that simplify this transfer and thereby make it more profitable, to determine the further gradual and controlled liberalisation by setting weight and price limits. But what will those limits be? Are we naively to grant 'freelance' enterprises the right to operate selectively and therefore circumvent the weight limit very easily since the content of letters cannot, of course, be checked? In any event, we ask the Commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals, having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the Member States. It is self-evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself, but only a means towards improving services. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the planned liberalisation of the traditional national postal services raises the inevitable question as to what the postal services will consider their core business to be in the future. In other words, what will the postal services be prepared to do themselves, what will they want to do together in international cooperation and what will they no longer provide? This question should be answered in light of the fact that the age-old monopoly has de facto been undermined by all kinds of courier companies and by technological developments, such as fax and e-mail. But then again, the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment. Past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an undesired effect. I would remind you of the fact that the Belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know-how and expertise from disappearing from the company. Once again, the point of discussion in the liberalisation of the postal services will no doubt be a reduction in the workforce. One should, however, be very aware of the fact that if people are encouraged to apply for voluntary redundancy, the company will primarily lose those people who already work under pressure or who can easily find employment elsewhere, in other words, they are often the people which the company in question needs. In my opinion, it would be a sign of well-thought-out human resource management if the Commission were to share a number of these concerns, so as to ensure that a sensitive sector such as the postal service is liberalised with minimum impact on social conditions. Mr President, postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so, given their importance. Only last week, in the UK parliament at Westminster the newly-elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners, Plaid Cymru, the party of Wales, made his maiden speech on that subject. The Scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices, especially in rural areas, play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities. Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services. Post office outlets in Scotland, as we have heard, handle much more than just mail delivery. Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents, local taxes and so on. But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts, so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened. If a rural post office closes, usually with the only local shop attached, then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result. Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems, governments, and the Commission too, should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon, providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents.	fi
I conclude, Mr President, by affirming that this progress is indeed difficult, fragile, and uncertain and it calls for constant vigilance on our part during the various stages of close and precise inspection that have long been advocated. Mr President, Commissioner, I rise to express the warmth and optimism with which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the start of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We are extremely hopeful that, along the lines set out by the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries, especially Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosovo and, as soon as possible, Serbia. We are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the Kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence, with all the consequences of that in terms of continental, if not world, instability. If the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia. And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent. It is in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement. Very rapid and direct involvement of south-east Europe in the life of the European institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the European Parliament, and that staff from those countries could work in the Court of Justice and the Commission. But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development. With this in mind, we have presented some amendments which I hope Parliament will accept. First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted. Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system. Thirdly, world aid and assistance coming into the region, and hence into Macedonia as well, should be clearly multilateral, and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country.	fr
I take note of what the report says on the horrific practice of genital mutilation and the lack of data on the subject. We will look, in the Commission, at ways in which we can contribute to the search for a solution. The Commission is also working with others to halt the heinous trafficking of women which has been growing in the last few years. We produced a communication in 1998 on this subject. The focus then was placed on prevention, research, law enforcement, effective sentencing of traffickers and support to victims. We are working on this, as the honourable Member knows, with NGOs, the OSCE and candidate countries. As for children's rights, the STOP programme has co-financed 67 projects dealing with trafficking and sexual exploitation of children with a budget of EUR 6.5 m for the first five years. A new STOP programme is planned to start from this year and this will be open to accession countries. Moving on to more general issues, I mentioned the forthcoming communication on human rights and external relations. My aim is to adopt a more effective and coherent approach to policy and to spending and in particular to improve the management of our programmes in this area. Human rights projects are very different from projects to build bridges or reinforce primary education. NGOs and civil society partners are integral to their implementation. The projects are often carried out in sensitive or dangerous conditions in the field. Those who implement the projects may even see their own rights threatened, which is no doubt why NGOs often feel a little aggrieved that they then have to provide the Commission with a shoebox full of receipts when they return to the office. The European Union's financial procedures, including the financial regulation are, to put it mildly, not NGO-friendly, which begs the question: should we stop funding NGOs or should we change our procedures? The former is clearly as impossible as it would be totally undesirable. We could not work without NGOs. Reform to our procedures, many of them determined by Member States in an era when NGOs barely existed, is going to take time but we are working on it, not least as part of the overall reform package. We will not, alas, see an overnight change. This brings me on to the budget and the Parliament's proposal for a joint declaration on yearly increases in human rights expenditure. The size of the budget cannot be divorced from the question of our capacity to manage it. Otherwise we will make too many promises which we simply cannot fulfil and when it comes to supporting NGOs you often operate on a shoestring. Broken promises can lead rapidly to bankruptcy. We have a backlog of projects to complete and we have underspent the human rights budget in the past so I would find it very difficult to justify an increase in spending until we have sorted this out. But I want to make this clear: I would like to put myself in a position as soon as I can where we spend every penny and can therefore justify spending a great deal more.	el
Scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the pathogen can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food. The disease is always fatal. As there is no vaccination, farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie. Even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings, the connection with BSE has still not been clarified, as I have already said. As a farmer myself, I am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk. I am in favour of preventive measures, starting with feeding which is suitable for the species, rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out. I therefore welcome the Commission' s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie. Mr President, Commissioner, Mr B√∂ge' s report on measures to prevent TSE diseases is based on the proposals of the European Parliament' s temporary BSE Committee. Mr B√∂ge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee, and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the BSE Committee in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has fallen to him: he is the one with the experience. I would have liked my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treated the second part of the Commission' s proposal. I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is featured in the plenary session. In the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease. It is indeed. For me as a Finn, and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals, it is most important that those EU states where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals. I wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease. The possibility, if necessary, of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement, as there really is justification for it. The inspections must be seen as being fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the EU. On behalf of the European Liberal Democrats, we can support the Commission' s proposal on Mr B√∂ge' s report, but in the forthcoming debate on Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where TSEs do not occur. Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur. There is no doubt that Mr B√∂ge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field. It is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important. Regardless of the many other concerns we may have, BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved. It is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem. I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will, I hope, address this situation. We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future. No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again. We have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work. It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it. BSE has certainly not gone away. You can see it in different countries. I do not want to point the finger at any particular country, but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom. It will be there for some time to come. We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability, of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain, is part of that confidence-building mechanism.	fi
Social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in Europe, and were achieved after many years of battling against the aspirations of big business, and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people. Today, in the Europe of unemployment and underemployment, it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people, but this demands a different system of economic and social development, which the EU cannot possibly create, because of its nature and character. On the basis of these views, we wish to express our categorical opposition to the 'modernisation' of the social protection system that the Commission statement is promoting, and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is under discussion. That concludes the explanations of vote. (The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) Next session of UN Human Rights Commission (continuation) The next item is the debate on the Council declaration on the establishing of the EU priorities for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (20 March 2000), including the situation in China. Mr President, I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. This is a Council declaration, and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate. I think it is worth reminding you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflects the need, which has been expressed by all the political Groups, for Parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue, one which is so dear to this House. Following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see. At a European Union level we must recognise that the situation is not completely satisfactory, since, for example, although the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a common instrument in all Member States, not all subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all of them. Another clear drawback in this area is the fact that the European Union itself is not a signatory to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails. I hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights. With regard to foreign affairs, I believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism, Mr President. Issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world, demand a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union. In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would like to stress one in particular, that is, the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations.	de
Secondly, and I am sure that the honourable Member recognises this as well, some of the tragic stories to come out of Kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child mortalities during carriage of a baby, but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born. Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities, or before the hostilities, tragically killed their own children. We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo. We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour, but it is not going to be easy. Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your response to the Member' s first question and the supplementary question. However, I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO, among others, are often of inferior quality. In some cases, there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like. Are you aware of this? Are you prepared to act upon it? This is my first additional question. My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica. You are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the Northern part of the city and that, given the tense situation, Albanian Kosovars do not have any access to this section at all. What does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital? On the first question, I am going myself to Kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and I will certainly look into the allegation made by the honourable Member about the ECHO food package. I have not heard that suggestion before, but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there. Secondly, I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica. I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago, I saw the situation there for myself. I had discussions with municipal leaders from both communities, including the leader of the Albanian side who had himself in the past been a doctor and was generally recognised for the medical work he had done during the hostilities and subsequently. So I know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in Kosovo, whatever ethnic group they come from. The particular difficulties in Mitrovica - for example, it is not just a question of Albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital, Albanian staff have had difficulty working there - are particularly acute problems. We will try to address them, but it is not easy. Question No 37 by (H-0029/00):  Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Commission taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	el
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes, indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did. A second observation, the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes. I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme. This cannot, however, be grounds for an extension of the original time limit. Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months. This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage. With regard to URBAN, I should like to conclude with a final observation. One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative. I agree completely. I myself expressed my concern at the meeting of Ministers for regional and urban planning, a concern to which I devote myself, that in the DOCUPs and the CSFs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate, my concern, as I said, that, apart from the URBAN initiative, urban issues should be addressed in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programmes, and I believe I can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them, beyond the scope of URBAN, in all structural fund programming. But, as for the future, since we must look ahead, I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms, and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn, because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be, for future financial perspectives, a new European regional planning policy. I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important. Let me repeat what I have said, we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming. I should now, Mr President, like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur, Francis Decourri√®re, in the same way that I thanked Arlene McCarthy, for the quality and relevance of his work. He stressed a number of points, with which we may indicate our agreement, as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands, cross-border, transnational, interregional; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG, its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures and what, in discussing another debate which begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen, and here, with INTERREG, thanks to INTERREG, is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners.	fr
Finally, on large-scale energy transmission networks, the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation. This is particularly valid for the region of the Azores which I have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions. It is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains, for example. Commissioner, thank you for your answer. However, I asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled 'International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor' . This project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for Structural Funds, such as those listed in Objective 1, might welcome this type of installation. We would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific 'nuclear research' context. You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks. Could you please give an answer on this issue? You are concerned about whether the Structural Funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere. Quite simply there is no question of this. I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation. As a result, the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected. However, you are right to question me as this is your task, as mine is to answer you. As has happened in the past, the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification. I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point. The Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible. I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks. The energy situation varies widely from region to region in the European Union. Assistance from the Structural Funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions, particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped. This is the only answer I can give you on the link between large-scale energy transmission networks and the Structural Funds. - Question No 46 by (H-0052/00): Subject: Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality, I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality. In particular, would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States, with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries?	fr
The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect. On the one hand, it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and, on the other hand, it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs. Finally, our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur, who has gone to a great deal of trouble. I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne' s reply. Mr President, the report deals mainly with formalities, in other words, the manner in which additives will be authorised. It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work. I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview. We cannot carry on as we have done up until now, that is to say dealing with each detail on its own, often only after the harm has already been done. The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives. However, I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics. Certainly, five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned. It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four, both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves. We now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people's health, particularly in the case of small children. A number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary. Several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same. We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but, in the case of antibiotics, it has long since been forgotten. However, there is another environmental principle at stake, namely the exchange principle. I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats. They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary. There is a substitute, which is used to vaccinate chickens. Although it is a little more expensive, it does not harm the environment. Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields. In that way, they end up in our water supplies which, as we all know, are our most vital resource. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives. Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition. You may recall, even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public, that the Commission' s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil.	fr
The opening of a building which was not finished, in the middle of an election campaign, which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied, makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous. I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish, because at the end of the day it was their responsibility, but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing, through its presence, this absurd event. I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Commissioner: does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be opened during an election campaign? Does it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the Spanish Government? It does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one Member State or another. As such, I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described. I have to confess that I fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony was held in Spain. What I can say is that I hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible. May I also add that I hope to be in Alicante myself at the end of May to speak at a conference. I hope that this building will then be occupied. I would like to point out to the Commissioner that it is not an electoral question. As members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons. A year later, it is still not functioning, which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening. We should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified. I would like to reiterate that the Commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of Member State actions. It is, however, interested in official statements and actions. We do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in French un proc√®s d'intention. We are concerned with public official actions and events, rather than any possible underlying motivation. This is why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question. Once again, the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned. It only appreciates that a building for this Office is opened and occupied as soon as possible. Also, the Commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or virtual. As far as I am concerned, all expenditure is real. And any remaining skeletons, I intend to leave them in the cupboard. Question No 54 by (H-0117/00): Subject: Alcohol monopoly and the internal market What action does the Commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the State alcohol monopoly apparently being planned by Sweden, and the associated import restrictions, and to ensure that the rules of the single market are applied?	fr
The fishery sectors in Europe face serious problems and I am a great supporter of the fishery sector. I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to find the information, the political will to provide genuine long-term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short-termism. I recommend the report to the House. The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission' s communication and we are also pleased that the Fisheries Committee adopted all our amendments. It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch. We welcome the intention of the Commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the EU including the common fisheries policy. After all, the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies. But as has been pointed out, the adoption of a rigorous definition of the precautionary principle is crucial. This is because it is all very easy to pay lip service to the idea and then to continue with business as usual. The UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard. One aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control. All the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected. Control is a Member State competence and the Council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries. This is a good step forward, but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee continually point out, much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all Member States. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.  Mr President, fishing is an extremely important economic activity which involves major investment. Most of its jobs are provided under fairly tough conditions throughout entire Community regions. However, some people' s view of the fisheries sector can be extremely simplistic, ranging from mere folklore to the insult of regarding fishermen as insensitive pirates and predators. I regret to say that this report, due to its link with the environment, seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular misconceptions. If Mr Katiforis' s report had been approved in its initial wording, none of the members of the Committee on Fisheries could have gone into any fishing region again without fear of being lynched. The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious. Yet it is very wide-ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport. To blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong. Our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which I tabled 14, many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which I thank him sincerely.	de
"At the same time, it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community' s financial interests, as Mrs Theato has explained very well. We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful. As the French say, ""ne jettons pas le b√©b√© avec l'eau du bain"" [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water], that is to say, in the protection of the Community' s financial interests, we must respect, on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizens, which affect the essential guarantees. The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly. Therefore, in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission. Mr President, this, as Mrs Theato said, is a critical report. It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report. One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement. It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is. We need to do something about it. Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget. A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done. We need to take this responsibility seriously. We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union. The question is: who prosecutes? That is where we really get into difficulty. Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers? We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States. The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one. We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people. But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions. Of most importance to Parliament, as the guardian of the budget of the European Union, is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions. At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal. People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted, and that is not the case at the moment. The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio. I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question. We are aware that it is a delicate debate. We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties. Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here, no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor. But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable. Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report. I think it is a first-class report which will, for the most part, be supported by my group. I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage. Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months, this could well be the case."	fi
We are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the Union, now and in the coming years. It must be taken into account that we have an open, globalised and very competitive economy. In order to reach and even overtake the leading position of the United States of America, we must avoid interventionism, as proposed initially by Mr Katiforis, and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures. Furthermore, the Member States refused to contribute more funds when we discussed Agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at Union level. However, we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws. There are still sectors such as air transport, energy and telecommunications in which, if we compare our unit cost with that of the USA or other countries which are equally competitive at international level, the cost supported by our companies is very high. This report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the USA is EUR 500 and in the European Union, on average, it is EUR 1 600. We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention. It is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the European Union. Mr President, the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in Mr Katiforis, in my view, only served to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people, social outcasts and those living a precarious existence in our European Union. This is the objective, in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament: give hope to the people of Europe. There is indeed economic recovery, but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe. The votes of the PPE-DE and the Liberals have very considerably diminished, and even reversed, the meaning of his message. That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment. What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report? First of all, the affirmation that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, that particularly respects the commitments of the European Union at the conferences in Kyoto and Buenos Aires. There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year 2008, by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions. A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport, energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet.	fr
