It is therefore vital that this House establishes as strongly as possible the principle of applying the EQUAL programme to all refugees. In conclusion, I would like to say that I had some qualms last week when we discussed the formation of the Austrian government. But when it comes to Austrian refugee policy, and we have to criticise it, I no longer have any qualms. I hope that Parliament will be just as committed this time. Mr President, under the 1994-1999 financial perspective, when 13 different initiatives were being implemented, the Interreg II cross-border programme was an important initiative. The fact that the next cycle of structural funds, 2000-2006, includes the Interreg initiative, I believe, demonstrates very clearly the importance that the national Member States of the EU attach to it. The Interreg programme for the period 1989-1993 and the Interreg II programme for the period 1994-1999 proved to be real successes in bringing together the economic and social development of border Member States. I come from the border counties of northwest Ireland, so I have seen over the years the important role that Interreg I and Interreg II have played, and I welcome Interreg III. The Commission is providing £67 million through the Interreg III programme, which will be spent on the further development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The European Union has played a key role in the development of the Irish border counties region over the years. The European Union is the major contributor, with £80 million allocated to the International Fund for Ireland. The European Union contributes 75% to the Peace and Reconciliation Programme. Overall, Interreg, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation Programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process. Mr President, I will speak on Interreg, limiting myself to a few critical points, and of course, to respect the time allocated to me. We all expressed our support for the confirmation of this programme and for the extension of the sectors of intervention, in addition to cross-border cooperation, to transnational and transregional cooperation. This does not, however, prevent us from being aware of the fact that the majority of resources – 50 to 80 percent – will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for component A of the Interreg III programme; moreover, we continue to believe that the choice made to consolidate the current sectors of cooperation on this component, in terms of the choice of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory. We hope and wish that, on this point, the Commission will acknowledge in substance, and not by formal tribute, Parliament's position. Cross-border cooperation continues to consider almost exclusively land borders and, where there have been exceptions with reference to maritime borders, these exceptions are not transparent in their choice and often benefit from compensation through other Community policies. The discrimination is truly much more serious for islands whose regional status can only be linked to borders of an exclusively maritime nature.	fr
"Unfortunately, the European Commission has already made progress on its guidelines and the position of the European Parliament has little influence on the programmes for the period 2000-2006. In the meantime, it is necessary to insist that the main priority of these funds should be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest difficulties and of the outermost regions, of which we have an example in Portugal with the Azores and Madeira, in order to achieve economic and social cohesion. In reality, however, the Commission's guidelines do not fully meet these objectives. On the other hand, it is important that there are precise indications and sufficient funds for sectors that create quality jobs and with recognition of rights and for those in which equal rights and opportunities are effectively promoted, for support to the social and solidarity economy, for rural development, for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas, particularly with regard to social housing, with a view to sustainable urban development. If the contents of Article 158 of the EC Treaty are aimed at promoting the harmonious development of the whole of the communities, we must say that the achievement of the elimination of disparities is still far away, indeed, in some cases, such as for the areas of Italy included in Objective 1, paradoxically the disparities are increasing, above all because of the still poor capacity of the structural apparatus to approach the Community procedures and the continuing cumbersomeness of the procedures; despite the regulatory interventions, in fact, the streamlining of the Community structures has yet to be achieved. If there is not first of all an administrative simplification, it will be difficult to achieve the Community objectives of reforms based on efficiency and concentration. In this sense, the Commission document is lacking, as it lacks any recommendation for the Member States aimed at simplifying the procedures and national regulations on the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities, as well as on financing, implementation and control. SMEs, micro-enterprises and artisans in particular are still ""weak subjects"", given that for them the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, represent major obstacles to accessing the Structural Funds. A handicap of considerable importance is the inability and impossibility of the Regions and other subjects to plan in advance, so that the Commission, which according to the decision on the guidelines 97/99 (Howitts report) should have consulted the Parliament in advance, in fact found a sort of convenient alibi in the establishment of the reduced planning phase in the Member States and published the guidelines already in July 1999, even before the newly elected Parliament began its legislative activities, thus preventing the Parliament itself from influencing the current structure of the guidelines. For this reason, the intermediate evaluation of Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99 will assume no small importance. The current guidelines do not generally have the merit of clarity and transparency. They only touch on the important issue of the possibility of measuring the progress made in terms of verifiable objectives and in full harmony with the strategies of Community policies and do not dwell adequately on the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications on the matter either for regional and national authorities or for the candidate countries."	it
All the Commissioners have pledged, whenever they must travel to a country, not just their home countries, to a region—I do this three or four times a month—to dedicate a moment of their time to direct dialogue with citizens, not just the prominent figures or institutional representatives we meet regularly. They also pledge to establish direct contact, in a university, a secondary school, a factory, to meet with people, answer questions, and listen. That will therefore be our participation, as will the honourable Members of Parliament, in this necessary effort, in this burning obligation, to reduce the democratic deficit, that is, the distancing of citizens from what we do. We wish to carry out this initiative in cooperation with the Member States, in contact with the European Parliament. We will periodically summarize this matter so that the state of public opinion can be accurately assessed and it can be adjusted or reoriented. We also wish to carry it out in consultation with members of national parliaments, local representatives, non-governmental organizations, socio-professional groups, and the media: opinion makers, political groups and parties, MEPs, national representatives, representatives—I just mentioned—of local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Social Committee, civil society organizations, and academic circles. I must also recall—and I need to do so—that the European Parliament itself took the initiative on February 1st—and I would like to thank Mr. Napolitano again for this—to organize an initial working meeting with representatives of national parliaments, that is, representatives of citizens in each of the Member States. The Commission will propose to the Member States that they participate in this operation, either within the framework of specific cooperation or a more structured partnership. We are preparing a plan for the media, in close contact with the Presidency of the Union and the European Parliament. I have already mentioned the conditions under which the Commissioners themselves will participate during the meetings and field visits. What we want is to hold public debates. Allow me—without intending to give lessons, of course, or even advice—to recall that, when I had the honor of serving as Minister of European Affairs in my country, I felt the need to engage in direct dialogue with the citizens, and that, by holding this dialogue every week in each of the regions, directly, I realized there was an urgent need for the European Union to have a face. So, I went every week, together with a European Commissioner—not just the French Commissioners, but also ambassadors accredited in Paris, MEPs—to engage in dialogue, and I realized that the questions were countless and intelligent, that people needed to be respected, to be listened to, and to be given explanations. That is what we are going to do, supported by a budget of around four million euros, if you, the honourable Members, would be so kind as to make it available to us.	es
We understand your concern and will take it into account, particularly in our future contacts with Turkey when defining the agenda for Turkey's planned accession strategy. This issue will, of course, be at the heart of our concerns, and the European Commission will certainly take it into consideration. Mr President, allow me to thank the President-in-Office of the Council. I am sure that the President-in-Office is a very good man and is very kind to his wife, children, and dog. However, you will forgive me if the answer you have just given leaves me a little skeptical. I do not believe that the public has immediate access to statements and votes in the Council. Could you therefore promise to write to me and tell me, before the next plenary session in February, where I, as an ordinary citizen, can find this information immediately after the adoption of a legislative act by the Council, instead of waiting for it to appear in the press weeks later? Will you write to me before the next plenary session to provide me with this information? Mr. Deputy, first of all, I would like to say that I exempt you from making personal comments such as the one with which you began your second question, and I would be grateful if you would refrain from doing so in the future. As for the substance of your question, we get the impression that the criticism leveled at the Council, apart from its specific form, which we also note, does not relate to the opacity, let's say, of the legislative process, but almost to an excess of transparency. I would like to tell you, Mr. Deputy, that the results of this type of transparency process are clear to us and beyond doubt. We will not hesitate to repeat this information to you in writing, Mr. Deputy, but we will not be able to go beyond what we have said because it corresponds exactly to what the Treaty requires. We therefore believe that all the information that the General Secretariat of the Council is currently making available to the public is essential information regarding the Council's functioning as a legislative authority. It seems to me that the Council has not attempted to answer my question. I did not ask what its opinion was on the proposal that the Commission has not yet presented. My question concerned the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Does it mean that transparency legislation must also be adopted at national level, and not just within the three European institutions mentioned in the article? I would like an answer to this question. Does the Council believe that it is possible, on the basis of Article 255 of the Treaty, to regulate national legislation on transparency, apart from that which should govern the European institutions?	fr
Next week, I will be going to the Bundestag in Berlin. I have already been to the French Senate. Throughout this debate, I will therefore also, whenever possible, visit the national parliaments directly. Dialogue with citizens is not about propaganda or marketing, or even public relations. I am aiming for a genuine dialogue, and after a short film objectively explaining the institutional reform, those on the podium will be able to speak and respond, with the microphone open. We will, as I repeat, carry out this initiative in ad hoc or ongoing cooperation with the Member States, and I very much hope that the governments of the Fifteen, with your support, will participate in this dialogue initiative under the conditions they consider most appropriate and appropriate. Mr President, I would like to join Mr Barnier's study group of 700 interns so that a discussion can take place. It's not really that interesting to debate the Intergovernmental Conference and openness with oneself. In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr. Barnier said in Parliament that social policy would not be subject to majority decisions. However, on page 63, it states that the fight against discrimination, the right to freedom of movement and residence—that is, the Residence Directives—the entire social security system, the renewal of Regulation No. 1408, and social policy measures, with a few exceptions, are to be decided by qualified majority voting. Does Mr. Barnier have no concerns that he is interfering in the electoral process of the Member States? Citizens go to the polls precisely for issues like these, thereby creating new majorities in the Danish Folketing and other parliaments. Can this be controlled from Brussels? Is this part of the radical decentralization that Mr. Prodi spoke about this morning? I was very pleased to hear last week that the Commission intends to devote more attention in the coming years to subsidiarity and its application to relations not only between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Union, the Member States, the regions, and cities. I hope that Commissioner Barnier, on his dialogue tour of the European regions, will explain this idea in more detail and will himself listen carefully and draw lessons. Commissioner, I refer to your answer to a previous question in which you discussed the possibilities of making the Treaty—as I shall call it—watertight in the face of the risks of undesirable developments, and in particular the diversification of the sanctions that can be imposed on a Member State under Article 7 for infringing fundamental freedoms. Do you consider that these proposals, or proposals of this kind, are part of the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference laid down in Helsinki? I, for my part, do not have that impression. Aren't you concerned that such sanctions could be misused not only against human rights violations, but also against mere differences of opinion, against crimes of opinion, or deviations from the prevailing European ideology of unity? Yes, Mr. Bonde, we will begin this dialogue with 700 young people in Brussels who will work in the institutions and the Commission, and I believe that starting with motivated young people is a good start for this dialogue.	de
Competition between regions will certainly strengthen the European Union, not weaken it. Here, I'll cite the issue of GA funding, the example of savings banks and state banks, and the example of quality seals. Here, a region has created something on its own to market its own products. This initiative must not be destroyed at the European level. I also think an increase in the de minimis rule is necessary. We should do everything in our power to encourage competition between regions. The second is a discussion about competition and the social market economy, although I'm not talking about market failure here. I've already touched on the area of state banks and savings banks, but I'll now summarize what one hears again and again from one side or the other. A resident of a retirement home today is housed in the social sector. But I can also consider them as a customer, and I think we should discuss quite clearly and in a timely manner where the social sector, where established structures, represent a barrier to competition. Otherwise, I can name any customer, any sector, as a customer, thereby severely damaging social sectors. Finally, I would like to say something about the principle of subsidiarity: I consider it urgently necessary that where Member States allow regions and municipalities to levy taxes, this should be maintained and not be regulated uniformly by Europe. Thank you very much, Mr. Colleague. I congratulate you on what in German parliamentarism is, in your case, inappropriately called a maiden speech. Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor on behalf of my colleague Robert Goebbels, who unfortunately cannot be here due to political commitments. Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Jonckheer report has sparked fierce controversy on the functioning of the market. A narrow right-wing majority has succeeded in removing any reference to market deficiencies from the report. If the majority of our Parliament were to follow this ultra-liberal concept of a supposedly perfect market, the world would not change for that reason. Real-world economic relations make it abundantly clear that the elimination of any government intervention in the market by no means leads to perfect competition and optimal resource allocation. While the market has been the preferred forum for human exchange since time immemorial, it has never been perfect. The market favors short-term business and quick profits. In the market, the balance of power between supply and demand generally skews the weakest—consumers and workers. To function, the market needs rules. The necessary and valuable entrepreneurial spirit needs a counterbalance, a sense of responsibility toward society. We, as European Social Democrats, are in favor of a social market economy. The market is not an end in itself; it must serve to improve living conditions. The European Union and states must not replace economic actors, but governments must establish the rules and objectives that enable the economy to develop sustainably. Ultimately, aid can be used to facilitate restructuring, provide training, and save jobs and thus know-how. The main objective of the Union’s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid.	de
I would be delighted, Mrs Schroedter, if you could consider the inclusion of this proposed amendment positively, and also in the interest of subsidiarity. Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has remained unanimous in saying that it is strategic and a priority to support interventions from the Structural and Cohesion Funds aimed at providing better employment opportunities for the unemployed and promoting equality between men and women. Unfortunately, Schroedter's excellent report did not take this criterion into consideration, despite the numerous proofs, and we will see this later in the Berend report, that these funds do indeed make a tremendous contribution to the most backward regions in reducing the gap between them and the most developed regions in Europe. They are growing, but in terms of GDP. Their competitiveness is increasing, but the increase in wealth does not benefit everyone because employment is not increasing and the difference in employment opportunities persists in certain regions. Commissioner, read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and give it priority, because that is where the main problem for citizens lies. In the revision, in the allocation of reserves, take strategic account of the need for jobs, because that is, ultimately, what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require. Mr President, it is important that the guidelines provide the right direction and strengthen the effectiveness of the programmes for the crucial seven-year period 2002-2006, so that sustainable development and support for employment, particularly for women and young people, finally become a reality, and that a balance is ensured between economic, social and environmental policies. It is particularly important to tackle acute urban problems, to safeguard employment in rural areas and, of course, to offer, as Article 158 of the Treaty specifically provides, equal opportunities for development to the islands of the European Union, including the Greek islands, which represent half of it. The Union's cohesion policy must be further strengthened, because a Europe whose regions have enormous disparities in living standards can be neither credible nor viable. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to tell you how much I have listened carefully to the observations, and sometimes the criticisms and suggestions, that some of you have just made in your speeches, based on Mrs Schroedter's report. Everyone understands, Madam Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons, the deadlines - I will come back to this in a moment - and whatever these deadlines or delays, since we are discussing this report now, I believe, on behalf of the Commission, that it comes at the right time, as regards the 2000-2006 guidelines, since we are starting the new regional programming. Madam Rapporteur, you rightly pointed out that, although it is indeed primarily up to the Member States and the regions to define their own development priorities, the co-financing of programmes by our European Union requires, justifies, that account also be taken of Community priorities as they are debated and approved here, in order to promote this Community dimension of economic and social cohesion that many of you have so forcefully recalled.	fr
"It is recognized that there is an inconsistent policy. Good intentions are made time and again, but in fact, nothing happens. It is therefore right that we highlight this today. I would like to give some examples to illustrate these contradictions. Some developing countries produce sugarcane for sugar production. Sugar is also produced in the Union using sugar beets. In order to prevent this cheap sugar from developing countries from competing with the more expensive EU sugar, a severe regulatory levy is imposed on it. The result is a severe restriction on sugarcane imports from these countries. At the same time, we provide these countries with very significant development aid. A minister from one of the Caribbean islands that produces this sugarcane once told me: ""If you allowed our sugar to enter the European Union normally, we would not need your development aid at all."" Another example: cocoa. The European Union wants to allow the use of 5% alternative fat in chocolate to harmonize the internal market. Zero percent could also be agreed upon, and the internal market would still be harmonized. If 5% is established, which for now seems likely, it is known that hundreds of thousands of small cocoa producers in developing countries will almost certainly be harmed. However, this seems to be the direction being taken. What are we doing? It is the typical policy of which our citizens say: really, what is Brussels doing? It seems that European companies are more important than our own principles, our own coherence, and the interests of developing countries. Likewise, in the area of sanctions and embargoes, there are striking examples. Why a boycott of oil supplies to Haiti and not against Burma, where an elected president has been arrested, parliament has been dissolved, and some MPs are in prison or even murdered? Why not a boycott of oil supplies to Sudan, where armed clashes continue, with the weapons, mind you, being paid for with money from oil companies operating in the territories where the refugees are located? The inconsistency is obviously colossal. Mr. Nielson has given us a fine example of the new Lomé Convention. If the new Lomé Convention is simply implemented, without all the inconsistencies being resolved, a policy is built on feet of clay, to use a biblical expression. The Council has repeatedly mentioned where the error lies: in agriculture, trade, conflict prevention, peace operations, fisheries, immigration, the environment. Commissioner Nielson, what we hope for is a good report on these inconsistencies and some concrete proposals to end them. I repeat, otherwise your beautiful examples, all your wonderful policies—and I say this to the Secretary of State as well—will be built on clay and, quite rightly, won't achieve much."	es
Paragraph 11 states that symbolic measures can replace the political agreement, the political perspective that being a candidate represents. But this is not only a masterpiece of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, dear colleagues, if the negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will enter into force in three years. And I challenge you to think that, among the Balkan countries, within three years, you will not have, from Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia, formal applications for membership. Mr. Racan announced, a few days ago, Croatia's formal application for membership by the end of the year 2000. I am certain that we will have other applications for membership and therefore that this fine work, this fine intellectual architecture will collapse, because it will be overtaken by events, just as we have been overtaken for twenty years by everything that happened in the former Yugoslavia. This would not be serious if there were not the problems that we know about in this region of Europe, if there were not the problems that are being faced but have not yet been resolved by the new government of Macedonia, the problems of cohabitation between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, with the related problems of Kosovo, if there were not the economic problems that we know about, the neighborhood problems with a particularly large mafia in Serbia, if there were not the problem that is a veto that should be denounced for what it is, the veto of Greece which, after almost ten years, continues to prevent this country from being called by its name, and I hope that the interpreters did not use the term FYROM when I was talking about Macedonia. This is absolutely absurd. I think this is an offense, first and foremost, to our Greek colleagues, to Greek citizens. It is urgent that this issue be resolved. Finally, by a happy coincidence, I received a letter from Mr. Georgievski, President of Macedonia, to Mr. Fischler, dated 8 March, in which, referring to Article 0, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he requests that Macedonia be allowed to join the European Union. Why did the Council not inform us? Why did the Commission not inform us of this formal request from Macedonia? Mr. President, Commissioner, the Balkans are not just a dark abyss, politically speaking. One only has to look at the clearly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia in recent critical years. The abominable ethnic escalation in neighboring Kosovo has not had a knock-on effect on its territory. Paradoxically, but nonetheless true, the war on the battlefield of Kosovo Polje has had exactly the opposite effect: the dangerous gulf of mistrust between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority has narrowed significantly. In the view of the former, the latter behaved loyally toward the common state during the international outbreak of the Kosovo conflict. And in the view of the Albanian minority, both the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have largely fulfilled their obligations as neighbors to the hard-hit Kosovo Albanian majority. This remarkable outcome of the Kosovo conflict can therefore rightly be described as the second pillar of internal politics in the Republic of Macedonia.	fr
And all this is in accordance with the principles that we have always supported. Thank you, Mr Segni, I will gladly do so. Indeed, this is entirely in accordance with the position that our Parliament has always supported. Madam President, I would like to draw attention to a case that Parliament has been following for a long time, namely the case of Alexander Nikitin. We are all pleased that the court acquitted him, reiterating that in Russia too, access to information on the environment is a constitutional right. Now, however, he will be impeached again because the public prosecutor will appeal. As we know and as we have pointed out in countless resolutions - including at the last plenary session last year - this is not simply a court case and it is a serious mistake to accuse Alexander Nikitin of having committed crimes and criminal acts, especially since we, as the interested parties, have benefited from the results of his research. These results form the basis of the European programmes for the protection of the Barents Sea. I would therefore ask you to look at the draft letter in which the main facts are set out and to support the position taken by Parliament with the Russian authorities, in accordance with your resolutions. Yes, Mr Scroedter, I will gladly look into the facts relating to the matter you raised as soon as I receive your letter. Madam President, allow me to begin by congratulating you on having kept your word. The number of television channels available in our offices has indeed increased enormously in this first part-session of the new year. However, Madam President, my request has not yet been followed up. It is true that we now have two Finnish channels and one Portuguese channel, but unfortunately the Dutch channel is still missing. And that is precisely what I had asked for, since we Dutch parliamentarians, when we are sent into this monthly exile, would like to be able to watch the news in Dutch. I repeat my request once again: please ensure that a Dutch channel is also made available. Mrs Plooj-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this item is on the agenda of the Quaestors' meeting on Wednesday. I hope it will be considered in a positive spirit. Madam President, I would like to know why this Parliament does not comply with the health and safety rules that it itself approves. Why have there not been any tests of the air quality in this building since we were elected? Why has the Health and Safety Committee not met since 1998? Why have there not been any fire alarm tests either in the Parliament buildings in Brussels or here in Strasbourg? Why are there no instructions to follow in the event of a fire? Why have the stairwells not been improved since my accident? Why is the smoking ban in non-smoking areas not being enforced? It is absolutely shameful that we, of all people, do not comply with the rules that we ourselves approve. Mrs Lynne, you are absolutely right and I intend to check whether everything you have said has really not been done.	it
The question is therefore: what requirements should possibly be placed on a monopoly or on part of the services controlled by a monopoly? On this point, most Member States have always refused to make any progress, and I am pleased to note that in my country the new government is concerned with a subject that should have been dealt with long ago, and that the Belgian Post Office and the Belgian Government are now taking the necessary steps to ensure that the Post Office is, in part, ready to compete by 2003. As a new Member of Parliament, I am therefore trying to familiarise myself with the matter, and I must frankly admit that this is causing me a great deal of difficulty. I have consulted a series of studies that were commissioned at the time by the European Commission, but at the same time I am finding documents from Post-Europe which state that these studies are not correct and that the basis on which they were carried out is erroneous. I think that the Commission could at least have been a little more active on this point and could have provided us with a little more information. She could also have sent us the studies she promised us and which we also requested. As far as I know, this has not yet been the case. I therefore ask you, Commissioner, to help a new Member like me with his difficult task. Like Mr Miller, I would greatly appreciate it if, in the coming months or weeks, and even if possible in the coming days, you could explain to us how far we have come with the implementation of the 1997 directive. Second point: what is the state of progress of the universal service, how much does it cost, how is it organized, how do you intend to organize it, what proposals can you make? I would like to receive more concrete information on this subject. Apparently, the postal service is a very powerful lobby, and rightly so. Hundreds of thousands of people earn their living at the post office. Furthermore, as Mr Miller also pointed out, my country will not be wiped off the map either, despite its population density, if the postman no longer comes every day. However, we have a large number of people in our country, elderly people for example, who only see one person during the day, and that is the postman. So let's try to take that into account as well. The post office is much more than just the transport of parcels and letters. For businesses, too, the post office is particularly important. A study shows that 90% of postal traffic is between businesses, compared to 10% between people. What do you actually want to liberalize? I would like to be better informed about this, because the most important question is how you can better serve the customer with the services that exist. There are postal companies that have a monopoly and still operate in a very valuable way.	fr
Reports must be submitted to Parliament's Committee on Fisheries before decisions are taken, otherwise we are simply an approval body. I know that this is hardly the intention of the Commission or the Commissioner, but we must learn from past mistakes. Mr President, we are faced with a proposal to transpose into Community law an ICCAT recommendation – which, as has been said, dates from 1998 – which should have been in force since June 1999 and which only reached Parliament at the end of last year. The Commission's legislative laziness on certain issues should not surprise us, except that we are faced with a recommendation from one of the most important international fisheries organizations on the protection of a resource as threatened as tuna. The Mediterranean, and in particular one of its areas, is a very important breeding ground for bluefin tuna, the commercial value of which is enormous. This is why ICCAT recommended this fenced area in the Adriatic and tightened the conditions for catching age-free tuna. As the rapporteur rightly said, both measures are fully and amply justified, which is why we can only ask for their approval. But I also agree with Mr Gallagher, who expressed his frustration at the Commission's slowness in getting the ball rolling and converting the recommendations into Community regulations. We are still waiting, for example, for the proposal for a regulation on the ban on imports of bluefin tuna from Honduras and Belize, a recommendation that dates back to 1996. According to my information, it appears that the Directorate-General for Fisheries sent a note to the Directorate-General for Trade in January, and that the latter has already begun the preparatory work. But four years to implement the ban on imports from countries known to favor flags of convenience is an absolutely intolerable delay, Commissioner. We have heard the Commission's explanations regarding the lengthy internal process of transposition, and the image that remains is one of exasperating bureaucracy. Regarding the sole proposal to speed up what is currently on the table, by which the Council and Parliament are excluded from the procedure, I have some doubts. In any case, it is clear that we will eventually have to find a solution to the problem, either within the framework of the Commission's report on regional fisheries organizations or, if possible, as quickly as possible. I assume that no one in this House is opposed to the principle of protecting juvenile marine organisms. Indeed, it is often pointed out that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy must be the protection and conservation of living aquatic resources. All of this is praiseworthy. Likewise, there can be no doubt about the enormous environmental and financial importance of bluefin tuna. As a seasoned fisherman myself, I wish for a return to the good old days of the 1930s when fishermen at Scarborough Harbour in Yorkshire caught bluefin tuna weighing up to 830 pounds. I don't know the metric equivalent.	fr
Competition, that is, the war between large companies, constantly results in layoffs, factory closures, not to mention the immense waste in the use of productive capacity. We have yet another example with the ABB Alsthom Power trust's plan to cut jobs in Europe. 18 million unemployed, 50 million poor in the European Union, yet one of the richest regions in the world: this is the result of this competition that the European institutions intend to foster. The Commission's desire to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is derisory, because the only law competition obeys is the law of the jungle where the most powerful crush or devour the weakest. This is especially revolting on a social level. The European Commission's report crudely shows that the Union's institutions are only interested in the large capitalist groups that are engaged in this economic war and not at all in the victims it causes. Nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent large companies from pushing a fraction of the population into poverty, simply to enrich their shareholders even more! So, if we recognize one merit in this report, it is that it shows that the working majority of society has nothing to hope for from the European institutions to preserve, let alone improve, their living conditions. By voting against this report, we are speaking on behalf of all those who have expressed their rejection, in Seattle and throughout Europe, of a world reduced to a strict market logic. We are voting against this report in the name of developing public services, and in particular, in memory of the victims of the Paddington train crash, who were killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to introduce competition where regulation was needed. This report is, at bottom, a primitive text inspired only by the law of the jungle, because competition cannot resolve any of the problems facing humanity at the turn of the century. Whether it concerns the balance of the biosphere, the promotion of culture or cooperation with the developing world, cut-throat competition is a factor of regression and insecurity. And do you think that the 18 million unemployed in Europe are victims of an overly timid application of this competition policy? We are convinced of the opposite, and we also do not believe that state aid is by definition too high. Compared to what iron rule, to what criteria of effectiveness would it be? Finally, after Seattle, do you seriously consider it necessary to advocate a greater role for the WTO? Only the legal advisers of multinationals can be so stubborn. Jonckheer report (A5-0087/1999) I welcome the quality of the seventh report on state aid in the EU, the fact that it is now published annually and the fact that the Directorate-General for Competition publishes general and specific information for the public on its website.	fr
I believe the European Union must do so. I believe the embargo against Serbia must be lifted and that, for its part, Serbia must release the political prisoners. Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully endorse Mrs. Pack's impassioned speech. What she said here is absolutely accurate. In Kosovo, there is not just one truth, there are several. I refuse to accept that we can speak of a reverse genocide, since to do so would be misleading. I fully support the motion for a resolution before us. In it, we condemn all forms of violence, as is right, but we cannot speak of a genocide in which the roles have been reversed. Obviously, the situation in Mitrovica is very dangerous, and we all know why. Important economic interests are at stake, and we cannot forget the tragedy of the Trepca mines. We have already referred to the fate of the political prisoners. There is much pain, much suffering in Kosovo. People are demonstrating, people are sending us emails. They are asking us where their children are, their sons. We must offer them a reasonable answer. The case of Flora Brovina is one of many outstanding cases. It is positive that we are addressing it in the motion for a resolution, but like Flora Brovina, there are hundreds, there are thousands. I ask the Commission and the Council, which is absent, to intervene without further delay on behalf of the political prisoners. The fact that they are imprisoned in Serbia is one of the factors at the root of the unrest and violence in Kosovo. Mr. President, paragraph 10 of the joint motion for a resolution before us rightly urges the Council and the Member States of the European Union to redouble their efforts to raise the necessary personnel and financial means to strengthen the United Nations police forces. This request is perfectly in line with the vision of the UN High Representative in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner. In order to successfully carry out his mission of restoring and safeguarding public order in Kosovo, he needs, according to his own estimates, at least 6,000 foreign police officers. The UN has promised, however, a police force of 4,800 men. However, for now, Kouchner only has approximately 2,000 police officers at his disposal. Moreover, half of this group comes from the United States and Germany. It is understandable that the UN High Representative is not at all happy with this situation, especially given the endemic ethnic violence in the area. Particularly disconcerting is Kouchner's virulent criticism of the French government in recent days. Paris is abandoning its compatriot to his fate in the midst of a crisis zone after sending him a handful of police officers, no more than 37. Kouchner points to none other than the Minister of the Interior, Chevènement, as the culprit for this dishonorable French stance. According to Kouchner, the Minister is preventing the deployment of French police officers to Kosovo for ideological reasons.	es
They therefore concluded that the voting system must take into account the demographic dimension and that the United Kingdom will not give up its right of veto. Is the Council examining this issue? Is it prepared to maintain the democratic right of veto, based on the actual strength of the population, or is it still leaning towards a simple majority vote by the members of the Council rather than a vote that reflects the European population democratically represented by them? Have the United Kingdom representatives communicated their decision and proposal to the Council and what consideration, if any, has it received? Since the issue of voting is fundamental to the democratic future of the Union, it should certainly be given the utmost attention. The way in which decisions are taken is of the utmost importance. Mr President, I thank the Council and the Commission for their statements this morning, but I would like to focus on policy coherence because that is the subject on the agenda. While I agree with the need to have a debate on the coherence of the different Union policies with development policy, I wonder whether this is the right time. However, the Council statement has given me hope for the future. It is clear to me, as someone who deals specifically with development policy, that there are many areas where the lack of coherence has dramatic effects in developing countries. I will give a few examples shortly. However, I would remind the House that as early as June 1997, a Council resolution recognised the existence of a serious lack of coherence between certain Union policies and development cooperation policy. In this connection, the Council asked the Commission to submit annual reports, the first of which was due to be examined in 1998. We are still awaiting the first report, and that is why I believe that the debate is premature, given that the Commission has had very little to say about coherence this morning. The areas identified by the Council are specific areas, where policy coherence is particularly important, such as peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution, food safety, fisheries and immigration. Some of these issues have been the subject of in-depth analysis. Personally, I believe that issues such as peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution are the responsibility of African heads of state, who should be given the support of the European Union, with the Organisation of African Unity acting as arbiter. The issues that do suffer from a lack of coherence are in areas such as agriculture, trade, the environment and biodiversity, but that is the real problem: these are highly sensitive areas in the European Union in general and in this Parliament in particular. MEPs will have different views, even within the same political parties, depending on (a) their country of origin or (b) the committee they are members of. There are aspects of coherence that I would like to look at as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some members of the Committee on Agriculture or the Committee on Fisheries.	it
My task as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is a very simple one. I can agree with the rapporteur and say that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has asked and urged the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to approve the Commission's proposal. This has gained me a great deal of time, which I would sometimes like to have for other things and which I will now use in anticipation, as Mr Böge has already done. My report on TSE has not yet been submitted to the House. We were somewhat undecided at first, although we regret that. But I have come to the conclusion that it is actually quite clever timing. It is actually quite good that we can already give the Commission a few things to think about on the basis of this debate, Mr Byrne. Since we perhaps did not interact so positively with one another earlier on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's report and certainly will not come to such close agreement, it may well be that things are somewhat different in this area. Let me say up front that the part of the complex report that Mr. Böge dealt with—incidentally, a form of good cooperation between two committees, where one committee takes the lead while the other issues an opinion, and vice versa, which could perhaps serve as an example for the future—is relatively simple. Things will become more difficult when we look at the TSE proposal, Mr. Byrne. If we then ask questions directly, the questions that Mr. Böge has already mentioned will arise. The question will arise—and I will have to ask this of you and the Commission representatives in the committee—what the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries will look like. How will the BSE status actually be defined? Will you possibly also consider the willingness to use a BSE test when considering the question of BSE status? And then my constant question to you, Mr. Byrne, which you certainly already know and which will not surprise you: What about the BSE test? When will you make it mandatory? Perhaps you could even do so before this Parliament debates the TSE report. Not that I want to delay it, but it would be a gesture, so to speak, if you could say: And here is the legislative proposal for BSE testing for you! I know I'm tormenting you with this, Mr. Byrne, but sometimes it has to be done. I say quite emphatically—and this also after Mr. Graefe zu Baringdorf's report, which is certainly linked to the overall idea—animal nutrition, animal husbandry, and animal production must be such that, on the one hand, it is species-appropriate, but, on the other hand, it must above all be such that it does not harm or endanger humans. It cannot be the case that you exempt cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other products on the grounds that no harm can occur or that they are not dangerous. That is certainly too brief, too concise, and too little. You are fortunate in Mr. Böge's report that he only touches on this in passing. But the problem you'll have with my report is that you'll have to justify yourself a little more, and you'll have a little more trouble with it.	de
Otherwise, I believe we are working on the symptoms but not combating the causes. The public is very critical, particularly regarding the use of GMOs. We must address the growing public awareness of GMOs and regulate their use in animal feed accordingly. Firstly, if an additive consists of or contains genetically modified organisms, it can only be authorized if it poses no risk to human health or the environment. Secondly, it is wise to lay down provisions for genetically modified additives in animal feed, similar to the rules in the law on the release of seeds, as the rapporteur has already mentioned. Thirdly, and finally, in order to have a transparent consumer policy, we need labeling for animal feed that is genetically modified. This explicit statement regarding the composition of animal feed therefore allows a dual freedom of decision, both for users of animal feed and for subsequent consumers. I believe that the decision should be up to the citizen. We are all talking about citizens who are shaken by scandals, who have lost confidence in the safety of feed. With consistent regulations on additives in animal feed, we can make a vital contribution to restoring confidence. I am therefore also very much looking forward to your response to our amendments. We will therefore naturally vote in such a way that we can possibly refer the proposal back to committee. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal to amend the directive on additives in animal feed, which dates back to 1970, is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of animal feed. Over the coming months, we will therefore be discussing some of these here in Parliament. The major attention that the European public has paid to the scandals involving dioxin, antibiotics, sewage sludge, etc. proves the crucial importance of this issue. It is therefore an important element in the protection of public health. This is why we believe that Article 152 should be used as the legal basis, and not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission. The amendment proposed by the Commission, namely equal treatment of additives that were authorized before and after 31 December 1987, is incontestable and has our full support. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has, however, unanimously made some important amendments to the Commission's proposal. The regulation proposed by the Commission carries the risk of monopoly in the marketing of certain additives. The right of petition is granted only to the party that received the initial authorization, but companies that subsequently received authorization are excluded. We should avoid such a monopoly, which could, for example, lead to higher prices for animal feed, by granting provisional authorisation to all companies that placed a given substance on the market before 1 April 1998. This authorisation is then valid until the re-evaluation procedure is concluded. The main change compared to the Commission's proposal, however, concerns the adoption of provisions on genetically modified organisms in the Additives Directive, recommended by the rapporteur. He took as his starting point the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on the authorisation of GMOs outside the Release Directive. This compromise already forms the basis for the authorisation of GMOs. It is therefore logical to also include provisions on additives in genetically modified animal feed in this case, in line with the regulations we have already adopted in other areas – I will mention only the area of forest reproductive material.	fr
I would like to point out that considerable progress has been made in this area in Italy; we were probably the first in Europe to adopt a regulation encouraging the take-back of end-of-life vehicles, but we also have a fairly obsolete vehicle fleet in our country and are therefore seriously concerned about the market problems that this directive could cause. I believe that the situation must be carefully analyzed. In Italy, approximately 80% of end-of-life vehicles are taken back and recycled, but we have a market problem which, given that Italian industry often resorts to furloughs and layoffs, could lead to employment crises and cause serious difficulties for workers in various parts of Italy. Therefore, I believe that we should try to reconcile the two requirements—I sometimes detect a somewhat extremist attitude in this Parliament, that is, either radically green or diametrically opposed positions are being put forward—and to find a synthesis, which, in my view, is essentially what the efforts of Mr Florenz and other Members to reconcile the two positions represent. As a result, we now have the interesting amendments before us; on the basis of the position advocated here, I believe a balanced solution to the problem can be found, reconciling environmental concerns with market and employment needs. Mr President, this directive addresses the growing but relatively minor problem of scrap cars, as well as the issue of more systematic disposal of all vehicles when they reach the end of their service life. For this reason, the directive may seem desirable, even if it is not urgently needed. The key questions that now arise are: who will pay the EUR 262 per vehicle for the nine million vehicles disposed of each year? Who will cover the costs of collection, dismantling, disposal, etc.? And should the directive apply retroactively to all vehicles ever produced? In the common position, the Council proposes that the cost should be borne entirely by the car manufacturers. This would amount to billions of pounds, or rather euros, being borne by the major manufacturers in each country of the European Union. The costs would inevitably be passed on to new car buyers. Since European car manufacturers have been in business for considerably longer than Japanese, Korean, or other companies, the burden on older European firms would be much greater, giving their competitors a significant competitive advantage. I support Mr. Florenz, Mr. Lange, and others on both sides of the political spectrum who have sought a compromise based on cost-sharing. I recommend that you support the amendment tabled by myself and my colleagues from Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom to remove the retroactive effect from the proposed measure. Retroactive legislation is bad legislation; it is unfair and often unworkable. It is rejected on principle by the majority of democratically elected parliaments throughout the free world unless there is an overriding public interest, which is clearly not the case here. That is why I have asked for a roll-call vote on this matter.	de
This is the area where the ideological battle for Europe is concentrated. I think the debate has made this clear. Tonight it has become very clear where the political divide lies, and it is therefore not surprising that this issue has polarized the debate in a House known for its striving for consensus and its policy of reconciliation. And I am pleased that this difference of opinion is so pronounced, because we are dealing with a radical report. This report is intended to shake Europe up. This report contains radical measures that will ultimately ease the labor market. It's that simple. The reason unemployment rates in Europe are so alarmingly high is that in many cases it is too difficult to recruit staff due to bureaucracy, the existing framework, and the inflexibility of the labor markets. The only way forward has now been shown. Social justice, and that is ultimately what we are all concerned about here, can only be achieved in Europe if there is prosperity, opportunity, and jobs. This report shows very clearly how these goals can be achieved most effectively, because Europe must wake up. You can't create jobs with government spending alone. You can't create jobs by legislating for reduced working hours, as if jobs were a cake to be cut up and divided among the citizens. The real world simply works differently. And if Europe is to be left behind, if it is to persist in stagnation and unemployment, in standstill and the estate system, then feel free to vote against this report tomorrow. But if you want Europe to develop further, to develop in such a way that its citizens benefit from it, then I call on all of you to support this report, because it will create the jobs and opportunities it needs. There is no other option. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, The great advantage of the original version of Mr Giorgos Katiforis's report was that it derived from the specific findings of the Commission's report on the EU economy important recommendations for a European Union strategy which could have given continuity and stability to the prospects of sustainable development which were emerging in 2000 for all the countries of our continent. These recommendations concerned the need for effective coordination of economic policy at Union level, that is to say, overcoming the separate management of economic and social policy which has hitherto seriously hampered the definition of a coherent strategy for combating unemployment, aimed at achieving full employment. It is this vacuum of economic management at European level, Mr von Wogau, which is at least partly responsible for the weakening of the euro. The report's recommendations also concerned the creation of a common European research area and the promotion of consistent policies in all Member States in the areas of research, lifelong learning, and employability, while eliminating all forms of unfair tax competition between states. Finally, the report updated and adopted the proposals of President Delors' White Paper promoting a European project for the creation of a single network of infrastructure and services. These recommendations, which largely coincide with the orientations of the Portuguese Presidency's program document and will therefore be discussed at the Lisbon Summit, were rejected or distorted in this Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs by a majority that found its fragile unity solely in ideological hostility to a European Union based on the convergence of national policies rather than solely on a market structure.	de
Many Member States have not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests or made any commitments in this regard, and therefore it was clear that something more radical had to be done. We need to take this responsibility seriously. We need to be able to prosecute those who commit fraud against the European Union. The question is: who prosecutes? This is where things really get tricky. Who is responsible when you are dealing with a structure that crosses so many borders? We also need to listen to the concerns of Member States. The proposal to establish a European Public Prosecutor's Office is very sensitive. We are all aware that a comprehensive federal approach and a European judicial authority prevailing over national judicial authorities are too premature for some people. However, the discussion must be started, and we therefore invite the IGC to do so. How we respond to the staff of the European Union institutions is of crucial importance to Parliament, the guardian of the European Union's budget. At a time when we are reviewing the entire reform process, it is essential that we send the right signal. Those committing fraud must understand that they will be prosecuted, which is not currently the case. Mrs Palacio raised the question of whether we have the legal authority to do so. I would like to make it clear that my group will be proposing an amendment to remove the details of how the Commission should tackle this problem. We know this is a delicate debate. We know that the Commission may need the opportunity to negotiate a situation that would be acceptable to all parties. Let me make it clear that there is no commitment here to a corpus juris, nor to a European Public Prosecutor. There is, however, a resolute commitment to a change in the status quo that is completely unacceptable. Mr President, I shall begin by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report. I believe it is an excellent report that will largely receive the support of my group. I only have the very clear impression that it would have liked to go even further. After listening to the debates of the last five or six months, that seems quite possible. We all know that in 1995 it was agreed that there should be better criminal protection for the financial interests of the European Union. Unfortunately, the Member States have not played along. This is purely a political matter and, at the moment, there is little we can do about it, it seems to me. There is, however, still the possibility that the Commission could take new initiatives on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty and I would suggest that the Commission do so as quickly as possible. Unlike the previous speaker, who has already left us, my group is very much in favour of the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor.	fr
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. Excessive deficits annexed to the Treaty establishing the EC The next item is report A50013/2000 by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(99)0444 - C5-0174/99 - 1999/0196(CNS)). Mr President, I also have the pleasure of welcoming the Spanish Commissioner, Mr Solbes, whom I have congratulated several times, both inside and outside Parliament, for the excellent work he has carried out in the Kingdom of Spain in the area of European convergence. The proposal to amend this regulation, relating to the application of the protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community, raises a fundamental question concerning the adaptation to the European system of accounts ESA 95 which, as you know, replaces the previous system of accounts integrated in 79 and, above all, a question concerning the emergence of new ranges of financial products, the consistency in the calculation of the proportions between the public deficit and the gross domestic product in the light of this European system of accounts 1995 and, finally, concerning the taking into account of the importance of the calculation of interest expenditure and their consistency with this new methodology. In my opinion, the proposal for a regulation aims to update the definitions and evaluations of certain economic operations involved in the calculation of the deficit within the meaning of the Treaty of Maastricht, which sets maximum percentages for the deficit of general government in relation to GDP at market prices in the various States. Until now, the Member States have calculated this GDP in accordance with the ESA 79 methodology. The latest estimate we have is the one submitted in September 1999 and which referred to the 1998 accounting year. Therefore, if this Regulation is approved, the estimate corresponding to March 2000, the first estimate of the deficit for the 1999 accounting year, will already be made in accordance with this new system. We know that the Member States have done their homework, so to speak, they have calculated and prepared their national accounts in accordance with ESA 95, and their corresponding estimates have already been published. This has meant, in addition to the incorporation of the new methodology, the nominal revision of most of the aggregates and accounting operations due to the methodological changes and more refined statistical information incorporated in the estimates. Naturally, these changes are likely to alter the public deficits in terms of the Member States' national accounts. And very briefly, I will outline the five areas that are perhaps subject to the most significant changes. First, the adjustments in the delimitation of what is meant by the institutional sector of general government according to ESA 95. This is important because the public deficit refers to what, in this case, the general government as a whole obtains.	fr
"Together with him, I thank those who collaborated on the project and all the staff working in the Commission, who took part in the widest debate ever organised within the Institution. I would like to underline that this method of debate is extraordinarily new and, in my opinion, has forced us to make radical changes in our way of thinking too. The White Paper, which we have before us, is also the fruit of their contribution: they have understood that only a profoundly reformed Commission can return to being that internationally admired institution which was at the basis of the history of Europe. With the adoption of the White Paper, a chapter of the past is closed - I hope, I trust - definitively. Now we look to the future, to the challenges that await the Union and to what we have already indicated in recent weeks, here before you, for the 2000-2005 programme. The reform finds its profound political raison d'être in these objectives of the five-year plan. We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission, a Commission that recovers the capacity to act as a political entity, recognisable as such in all its actions. This is why we are redefining all the priorities on which to concentrate our work. This is why - this is another important chapter - we are freeing ourselves from activities whose management we no longer deserve to be responsible for, consistent with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity. This is why we are reforming the administrative machine, so as to create the conditions to carry out our tasks effectively. We will make the best use of our resources, which are already very limited and which we are using up to the last part. If the need arises, however, I do not rule out coming back here, before you, to ask for additional resources for the new tasks that exist and that will be entrusted to us. In September we made a commitment to reform with the presentation of the White Paper and today we are respecting the commitment made, in the terms we made before you. The Commission wants to be judged by the facts, only by the facts, based on what we achieve. I would like to remind you - and this is my final reflection - that the Commission is not the only Community institution. Parliament and the Council are equally called upon to fully accept the challenge of these reforms. The Commission has resolutely opened the way: I hope that all the institutions will follow it to the end, in the service of European citizens, for an ever stronger and ever more transparent Europe. I am pleased to take part in today's debate, together with Commission President Prodi and my colleague Commissioner Schreyer, to present the White Paper ""Reforming the Commission"" adopted this morning by the Commission itself. As the honourable Members will be able to see by reading the document that will be made available to them today, the consultations (which are an absolute novelty), carried out with Commission staff, with this Parliament and with the Council since January when the consultation document was approved, have been very productive and have resulted in useful improvements."	it
It is for this reason, esteemed Commission, esteemed Presidency of the Council, that we urge you to seize this political initiative to prevent us from once again finding ourselves in an emergency situation that forces us to restore our ability to pay after a month. On the contrary, we must develop a long-term aid strategy for the region. I hope that you will finally fulfill your political obligations and that the situation we have experienced in recent months will not continue! Mr. President, when the Alliance intervened in Kosovo, it did so with the aim of restoring conditions in that province that would allow those who wished to remain there or return to it, to their roots and their own culture. The Alliance is present on the ground today with the same objective. The day before yesterday, I listened with satisfaction to an interview given by the KFOR commander, who indicated to what extent things were beginning to improve in this regard in Kosovo, to what extent crime rates had returned—particularly in the area of security—to an acceptable level. Those on the ground representing Europe in pursuing this objective—and I am thinking in particular of the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General—are on the verge of discouragement, precisely because, as things are improving, there is less talk about Kosovo and the urgency of the aid that must be provided is less evident. We must work to ensure that in that province, and throughout the Balkan region in general, the era of merchants replaces that of warlords. It is true that financial aid in this regard is undoubtedly an essential element of the possibilities for action that will be offered to those on the ground. I echo here the statement just made to us by Mrs. Pack and I insist that we in the European Parliament must fulfill our responsibilities in this regard, but I ask, of course, that we not be the only ones. Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Brok, for his report. It is true that if the Council had worked with the same speed as Mr. Brok, we would be further ahead. The Council's delay in this matter is truly unforgivable! The rapporteur and the report rightly assume that we urgently need to provide assistance, although they also rightly point out that this cannot be unlimited or arbitrary aid. I would like to refer specifically to Amendment 5, which unequivocally stipulates that only those Kosovar budgetary needs arising from public, semi-public, municipal, and other administrations and institutions controlled directly or indirectly by UNMIK may be financed from the funds provided by exceptional financial assistance. This must be clear, Commissioner: we support UNMIK, we support the institutions established by the United Nations, paying particular attention to the Fourth Pillar, of course. It is therefore inconceivable that we should support the parallel structures that have been created in Kosovo and that continue to operate in the same way as before.	es
Therefore, if he has any lessons to teach, they had better be in this House. He knows me well enough to know that at all levels at which we have worked together over the course of five years, there has not been a single occasion when I have refused to respond fully, formally, and in detail to everything I have done. Mr. President, let me begin by paying tribute to Mr. van Hulten for the painful work involved in preparing his report, which, moreover, from what I have heard, has been a suffering he willingly accepted. Although relatively new to this House, he is also relatively experienced in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the institutions as a former civil servant—and I think the value of this is evident in his skill in dealing with this issue, which, as several Members have said, is of such importance to all our institutions. I thank him and wish him a long and distinguished career as a Member. Mr. President, as you will know, Mr. van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long, and since I wish to provide a comprehensive response, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I appeal to your indulgence. Naturally, I will not use the House's time beyond what is absolutely necessary. When this House dealt with the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, on behalf of the incoming Commission, I promised that the report would be considered as one of the key ingredients of the Commission's reform proposals. Our efforts to honor this promise will be evident to this House when we proceed to debate the reform package approved by the Commission today, well within the demanding deadline we set ourselves four months ago. I am sure this will encourage Mr. Pomes Ruiz. Most of the proposals in the document are very similar to those outlined by Mr. van Hulten, and—I address him and Mr. Staes—the document includes a very explicit timeline of the actions to be taken to undertake the reform. There is, therefore, nothing left open or vague about the report I have had the honor of compiling. The perspective of this Parliament in the consultation period of the next four or five weeks will be, for obvious reasons, of great importance. I would say to Mr. Elles that we are definitely in a position to listen. But I am sure he will appreciate—with his customary generosity—that for us to hear the response to what we are proposing, it is necessary that we first transmit what we are proposing. Therefore, here is the transmission. Although time prevents me from commenting before the Assembly on each element of the resolution in this debate, Mr. President, I can immediately assure you that the details will be treated as an important contribution to our reform proposals throughout this consultation period and, certainly, to our work in other relevant areas.	es
On the other hand, investor protection can often be better ensured by an actively managed fund. Ladies and gentlemen, my Amendment No 47 goes in this direction. As regards the proposal for a new provision that would limit investments in a single group to 15 percent, I would like to point out - apart from the fact that this limit is too low - that the text does not provide any definition of the concept of a group, a concept that does not exist in European law, because it is impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice. I will therefore vote against this proposed amendment. In conclusion, Mr President, allow me to remind the honourable Members that, although the directive needs a new look to make UCITS even more attractive, it does not need a European corset that would suffocate them. Mr President, with the advent of the euro and the increasing liberalisation of capital markets, a larger and more solid European financial area has already emerged, which contributes to expanding markets and increasing price transparency, but also to creating fiercer competition. We must also take into account the economic weight of financial transactions, especially those under discussion today. At the end of 1999, there were almost 15,000 investment funds registered as UCITS, with a global value of more than EUR 2 billion, corresponding to approximately 75 percent of all fundraising. The economic weight was therefore rightly put in the foreground by the Commission also in its proposals for draft directives, and I must say that the Commission's proposal seemed particularly convincing to me. We all know how difficult it is to improve the regulatory framework for investment funds, and how difficult it is to also define the European passport for management companies on the basis of specific criteria that are interpreted by everyone in the same way. The proposal therefore represents progress in terms of the rules and provisions for monitoring financial markets and products. I also believe that the main aim must be maximum consumer protection, and I think it is very important that this is explicitly stated in the Commission's proposal, in the European Parliament's proposal, and in the compromise proposals. As regards OTC products and derivatives, I believe that it is not possible to assess the risk inherent in them, and I think that the European Parliament should let consumers know this. They think that investment funds are comparable to traditional savings instruments and that they can offer long-term security, so much so that they were also known as investment and savings funds. The European Parliament must continue to explain that these are different things, and for this reason a minimum level of protection is necessary. Why not take inspiration from the system of minimum protection contained in the Securities Trading Directive, for example that of Article 11, relating to fair conduct? In my opinion, this is therefore another step forward that we can take; it would be appropriate if consumers and investors could already get an idea of its risk structure based on the name of a fund.	it
"We should also judge the Lisbon Summit in the light of its contribution to achieving this objective. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, do you know how Archimedes expounded his theory of leverage? He said: ""Give me a fulcrum and I will move the world"". Clearly, in Lisbon you will try to move the world, or at least our world: the European world. As for leverage, you have described all its mechanisms in the course of your enthusiastic speech, which was enthralling in many ways. The fulcrum remains. The fulcrum is the means. Well, you are now before an Assembly which includes many Members who still have a vivid memory of what I would call the White Paper syndrome, a formidable initiative by Jacques Delors which crashed into the accountants of ECOFIN. And we would not want you to have the same misfortune today, because the project you are offering us is so exciting that it could really revitalise Europe, giving it the future that our colleague Goebbels reminded us of. But we need to have the means: means that, I fear, you are sorely lacking today. It is up to you to create them, then. And it is certainly not from the Agenda 2000 corset that the necessary resources will emerge. You will therefore have to persuade your colleagues to ensure that the proposals that are addressed to us are actually financed. One example among others - and relating to a relevant aspect of what you are proposing - is that of the information and knowledge society. It is clear - and you have illustrated it adequately - that the social divide is a problem against which we must fight. But we must be careful not to add to it what I would call the digital divide. In fact, to whom do you intend to propose this information and knowledge society? To an increasingly older or increasingly senescent population, to a population that remains, despite everything, poor and to a population, alas, increasingly less educated. It will therefore be necessary to intervene at the base, if we do not want this knowledge society to turn into a race for profit by a few start-ups as dynamic as they are necessary. But that is not your objective. In the device that you have envisaged there is an absence, which I deplore: that of public services. In the history of our European social model, public services have played an essential role. Today, in fact, it is no longer the time of monopolies and the Commission has initiated a process of liberalisation, of opening up to competition in a series of public sectors with the aim of making them more modern and efficient. But we cannot stop there. We must now define more precisely, in the context of competition and the information society, what will be tomorrow's main public service functions required of public companies, but also of private operators in that same sector. In this respect, more incisive initiatives will be needed, which are not yet included in the Commission's work programme, but which you could promote: this would, in my view, be an extremely important signal. Finally, the knowledge society is based on research and development; in this context, I would like to welcome the Commission's initiative to create a European research area."	it
"The measures envisaged in this resolution are, however, derisory in their attempt to stop the policies of large industrial groups that are cutting jobs and increasing unemployment. Moreover, these are only words, because socialist governments, which are in the majority in Europe, are just as incapable as right-wing governments of taking the necessary measures to prevent layoffs. The real problem is not finding legal arrangements that further complicate layoff procedures, but to prohibit them. The only way to stop this infernal mechanism that produces financial surplus value on the one hand and unemployment on the other is to prohibit layoffs in all large companies that make a profit, under penalty of expropriation, and to make the accounts of large companies public and subject them to the control of their workers and the entire population. Society must have the means to impose its own priorities on large companies and their owners, including, first and foremost, the eradication of unemployment. The sums needed to create useful jobs in public services, as well as to finance the distribution of work among all, without a reduction in wages, must be taken from the profits of large companies. This is infinitely more important for the majority of society than waste in financial operations, or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders. I cannot support this resolution, because in point 8 it mentions the case of an Italian factory which it is hoped will be preserved, while at the same time, the current management of the company is advised to try to sell the factory to a European tire manufacturer. It is not for the European Parliament to say which factories in the fifteen Member States of the European Union should be preserved or closed, in which workforces should be increased or reduced, whether to maintain their current location or relocate them, whether to sell or not sell, or, if necessary, to decide whether they should be sold inside or outside Europe. Ultimately, these are areas of competence in which the European Parliament and its Members do not have the legal power to change a given decision, nor do they even have in-depth knowledge of the situation in the factory concerned. The Swedish Christian Democrats reiterate that it is important that the European Union and the European Parliament devote themselves to their basic mission and do not weaken the value of their action in these areas by exceeding their competences. Potential of tourism for employment The next item is the joint debate on the report (A50030/2000) by Mr Viceconte, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission communication: ""Increasing the potential of tourism for employment - Follow-up to the conclusions and recommendations of the High Level Group on Tourism and Employment"" [COM(1999)0205 - C5-0112/1999 - 1999/2115(COS)]. , rapporteur."	fr
"We need a streamlined approach to tourism, one that covers all policies. I am confident that we will make progress on this in the future, when we have a good report from the High-Level Working Group, the support of this House's report, and also when the tourism sector comes back into the spotlight of enterprise policy. Why is this so important in this sector? Because, in enterprise policy, the main focus will be on helping new businesses to start up, on making it easier for young people to start their own businesses. That is where the potential lies. If we can remove barriers and lower the cost of starting a business, make it easier to access finance, and change the attitude of society so that it has a more positive entrepreneurial spirit, I am sure that the tourism sector will be the first to benefit. This is one issue that I hesitate to mention today because I am new to this sector. I have worked in all sectors of industry and services, but when you look at the organizational structure of the tourism sector, it is almost impossible. It is very difficult for a Commissioner to try to work in a sector with dozens of organizations whose representativeness must be checked every time. To strengthen the role of tourism in Europe, organizations should do what has been done in most economic sectors: seek better convergence, better coordination, and concentration of activities. We could then begin a serious dialogue in our daily work. This is the main difficulty we need to overcome. As for the Treaty, the Intergovernmental Conference started this week, so we do not yet know the results. I want to be very frank: I have not noted a great deal of enthusiasm for this Conference or for the proposal to expand the EU's powers. Tourism is also on the list of subjects that are not among the new areas of competence for the EU. We will see what happens, but for the time being, that does not seem to be the case. Finally, the Commission welcomes the resolution that aligns with the High-Level Group, the Commission's communication on increasing the employment potential of tourism, and the related Council conclusions. The general agreement reached between the two institutions in this area should not prevent the Commission from following the most pragmatic approach to achieving our common objectives. Thank you very much, Commissioner. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m. (The sitting adjourned at 11:45 a.m.) Adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting The minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments? Mr President, naturally, the minutes of yesterday's sitting will have included the speeches relating to the so-called ""Strasbourg Declaration"" aimed at implicating this European Parliament in considerations which, literally, come to the conclusion that this MEP is a Nazi. The declaration - which, as I say, implicates the European Parliament, although such a declaration was not made before the European Parliament - is a completely unacceptable manipulation."	fr
There must be a willingness to cooperate. If, in a certain sense, it should not be understood as an obligation, but as a willingness, a possibility, that each country should take advantage of, then this approach is the right one. If we look at FYROM/Macedonia, we will see that with some neighboring countries this cooperation, for example, in economic matters, is very complicated, as with Kosovo and Albania, or is difficult from a political point of view, as, for example, with Yugoslavia. On the other hand, collaboration with Bulgaria and, in particular, with Greece, has developed positively, which also deserves our recognition. In this context, the European Union must reflect—it began to do so at the beginning of this week—on how it can, despite everything, include neighboring Yugoslavia without overlooking any criticism of this terrible regime of regional cooperation. Therefore, tomorrow I will submit an amendment in which we declare ourselves in favor of sanctions being imposed on the regime and, on the other hand, nevertheless alleviating the situation of the population and the economy through economic cooperation. In this regard, I am grateful—and I allow myself to mention it here, given that I am from a country through which the Danube flows—for the reflections put forward by the Commission, that is, by Commissioner Patten, but also by Vice-President Palacio, with whom I recently met in Budapest, on the possibility of making the Danube navigable again, thereby promoting a minimum economic recovery in this region, which would undoubtedly also be important for Romania. In my opinion, this regional approach, if I have understood it correctly, that is, as a method of contributing in some way to the economic recovery of the region, is the right approach. As I have already said, it cannot be interpreted as an obligation nor imposed as a precondition. Secondly, I would like to make it clear that we want FYROM/Macedonia to be opened up and offered the path to the European Union. We maintain that it is illusory to believe that it would be appropriate to submit the application for membership now, but we also consider it wrong to say that we will discuss it someday. FYROM/Macedonia wants the answer that, in principle, it will have the opportunity to do so when the time is right. The country fears being somewhat abandoned on a dead end. In the complete reorganization of support instruments, it sees no danger in being the last carriage on a train heading towards Europe, but rather in that train continuing towards Europe and Macedonia ending up on a dead end. But I believe Commissioner Patten will show understanding for the problem. I urge him to make this point clear in the discussions in which he participates. Third: In my opinion, FYROM/Macedonia has shown so far, beyond any doubt, that it is capable of making good use of the instruments at its disposal. Although, of course, changes will occur, FYROM/Macedonia will continue to demonstrate that many of the tasks currently being addressed in Brussels can be undertaken in the future in Skopje, in the country itself.	es
However, it was agreed that other points could be included, which is why the representative of the northern part of the island, Rauf Denktas, proposed three new topics: the question of sovereignty, the question of confidence-building measures and the lifting of the embargo on products from the north of the island. Two main developments have emerged from the discussions held so far: first, the possibility of establishing a direct information channel between the European Union and the northern part of the island - without this necessarily implying its recognition as an entity with legal personality at international level - which aims to facilitate the adoption of a Community acquis for the possible accession of the whole island, should a solution to the global problem of the division of the island be found in the meantime. The second development, which we consider important, is the statement made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the end of the first day of the talks, in which he stated that if a global settlement of the situation were to be reached, this would imply recognition of the specificities of the north of the island. This is the position taken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and it is an element that we will have to take into account in our future analyses. There are many expectations regarding the third round of negotiations, given the scenarios that are emerging and in which the intervention of representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom is contemplated, particularly in the area of security and the constitutional framework. It is expected that these issues will be addressed in this round of negotiations with the mediation of the Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, which should take place after the elections in the north of the island, scheduled for 18 April. The Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has decided, among other things, following the example of choices made by previous Presidencies, to appoint a representative to maintain contact with the various parties involved. This representative has already contacted the parties and is following, in close connection with the Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the work of the various rounds of negotiations. In particular, it is our intention to maintain a constant presence of the European Union in this area, especially, of course, since Cyprus is a candidate for accession to the European Union on the basis of a rather advanced negotiation process, which naturally raises many expectations and ensures that the European Union has a significant role in this context. The approach followed in the discussion and our participation in the discussion itself have been marked, in principle, by taking advantage of a certain easing of the climate of tension, due to the conviction, apparently shared, that it is necessary to continue negotiating and that the continuation of the negotiations and the maintenance of the expected pace represent in themselves an essential element of hope for reaching a final solution. There is still another important element, which I already mentioned at the beginning of my speech, which concerns Turkey's commitment to contribute to the preparation of the accession of the north of the island. We are of the opinion that it is not enough to read carefully and cautiously the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council, but that we must also verify what might be the willingness of the Turkish authorities to contribute to the solution of the issue.	it
It simply offers, and only where certain requirements directly related to the activity are required, the possibility of selection. This is, therefore, positive discrimination. In the example you have given, in the Catholic school, it seems logical that the teachers should be Catholic. Only this type of exception can be accepted. Question No. 41 by (H-0813/99): Subject: Employment promotion for women in highly disadvantaged areas. In view of the enormous difficulties women face in accessing employment in some highly disadvantaged areas, and taking into account that they very often lack the minimum economic capital, a business or cooperative tradition, or training facilities, and live in rural areas where the poverty line affects up to 80% of the population, what measures or actions are planned to enable these women to overcome the social barriers in their environment? Will the Commission propose minimum policies appropriate to these extreme but real situations? Will these women once again be left out of the new employment policies? - (EL) It is clear that for the most disadvantaged areas of Europe, there is cohesion policy, and for cohesion policy, there is the collaboration and joint action of the Structural Funds, the European Social Fund, and the Agricultural Fund. It must be said that the resources available for troubled regions represent a third of the total budget. These regional policies, which are implemented, following commonly agreed guidelines, of course, in each of the Member States—that is, each country is responsible for implementing this program—pursue the objective of increasing job opportunities for both men and women. We must point out that 70% of the funding for the period 2000-2006, which amounts to €195 billion, will be granted to the most disadvantaged regions of Europe. Turning specifically to the issue of women's access to the opportunities that arise, it must be said, first, that the European Social Fund includes a whole line of action, which must be implemented by the Member States, that relates to equal opportunities, that is, specific policies for which Social Fund funds must be used and which concern women. Second, the LEADER initiative, which is currently still under review, gives special priority to development strategies that propose specific support for women in small businesses in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism, with the aim of increasing women's participation and involvement in rural areas. Thank you, Commissioner, for your well-intentioned response, delivered with rigor, which I value in its terms. However, I assure you that, with the existing resources—to which you refer—we are not reaching these very disadvantaged areas. Because these are areas where the deprivation overlaps, and we must compare them with the areas where we work in cooperation, where there is almost nothing. Therefore, my question is whether you could study the possibility that some of the microcredit policies, which have been successful in cooperation, could also be applied to these women in very disadvantaged areas, where everything is against them.	es
The aim of the current regime was to eradicate ISA as quickly as possible. The reality is that the policy of forced culling has failed to contain, much less eradicate, ISA. While the current regime has failed to achieve its objective, it has had devastating economic consequences for the industry, without any compensation or commercial insurance. Two main changes are proposed. The first concerns the authorization of vaccination as a weapon in this fight. This is a necessary change that should be accompanied by efforts at the European level to initiate and fund research to develop an effective vaccine. The second proposed amendment proposes a gradual culling of fish from infected farms, based on the severity of the disease on each farm. This strategy has proven very effective in Norway, where the number of new cases has declined to a handful per year, following a peak of 80 to 90 cases per year in the early 1990s. I therefore support the amendments proposed by the Commission and call for their immediate adoption and implementation. I also draw attention to the issue of compensation and call for an amendment to Council Decision 90/424/EEC to explicitly include ISA in the annexed list of diseases. This will allow compensation to be paid 50% by the Member State concerned and 50% by the European Commission. I thank my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries for their overwhelming support for my report, and I particularly thank my Scottish colleagues on the committee for their valuable input. I reject Amendments 7 to 13, which were also firmly rejected by the Committee on Fisheries. They are either largely superfluous or already included in my text. I have highlighted in particular the need to investigate the extent of any interaction between farmed and wild salmon, to research the causes of ISA, and to test wild stocks more extensively for the virus. These amendments, tabled by the Greens in the Green/European Free Alliance Group, are intended to provide justification for Amendment 13. This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate, as it not only seeks to maintain the immediate compulsory culling of all fish, but also prevents the sale of fish from infected farms, whether infected or not, and I must stress that, under current policy, no infected fish will be put on sale. There is no proposal to change this, and under the proposed new rules, the sale of infected fish is completely out of the question. Amendments 7 to 13 completely ignore the reality, which is reflected in the stark contrast between the situation in Scotland and that in Norway. Scotland has a draconian regime in place, but it has failed to achieve its objective. In Norway, where they have considerably more experience, 100% eradication was abolished years ago, and thanks to a series of measures, the situation has improved immensely. It is in all of our interests that we succeed in containing ISA in Scotland and preventing its further spread.	de
During a recent visit to Brussels, the duly accredited representatives of these fishermen traveled from Northern Ireland and were threatened with exclusion from the meeting when they sought to plead their case, which they had prepared very well. This is scandalous; attention must be paid to their case. This must be stated publicly, and I want to state it publicly. I was at the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would disappear from the Irish Sea, and at this very time, haddock reproduction was experiencing a particular and dramatic increase in the Irish Sea. So the scientists could be wrong. As I said, all parties in Northern Ireland agree on this issue, and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision, the consequence of which can only be the ruin of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland, not the conservation of fish, which will affect all fishing industries in this Union. Mr President, the reports by our colleague, Mrs Attwooll, are of great importance, as is the availability of as much data as possible on the Member States' fishing sectors, especially as the Commission approaches its obligation to draw up a report on the review of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2002. However, the fact that these updating and submission obligations are merely optional and relate to very different data and sectors may distort the ultimate objective of the Commission's proposal. Thus, as has already been pointed out here, it has been shown that, within the framework of the MAGPs, countries that have complied with them to the letter and submitted their data to the Commission have been significantly disadvantaged compared to those that have not complied with them or simply have not provided such data. It should also be pointed out that not all Member States have the same amount of data. Some people have different sectors and, given the volume of data they have to submit, they might feel disadvantaged compared to those with a smaller volume if they are given the same deadlines. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to adjust these submission deadlines. As has already been pointed out here, much of this data is also confidential because it concerns the very competitiveness of the sectors involved and their companies. We must therefore act with great caution in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data. Some of it is inappropriate, as has also been pointed out, particularly that relating to business taxation. In any case, Mr President, and since I do not want to go on any further, aware of the time constraints, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, on the considerable work she has done in our committee. I would like, in turn, to congratulate Mrs Attwooll and say that I agree with most of what she has said. I consider it a weakness of the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States. I cannot understand a proposal to establish a regulation that some Member States could dodge without incurring a fine, nor can I understand that within a European Union that is only 50% self-sufficient in fisheries matters, there is highly sensitive information and that by drawing up the necessary reports, the national or regional interests of certain states or fishing communities are being put at risk.	fr
This is essential for the correct and reliable determination of deficits. This adjustment will enable a more precise assessment of deficits and debt levels in the Member States. This technical adjustment will have very concrete effects on the actual situation of the countries, as the data will be automatically adjusted according to the government deficit. I also welcome the fact that the assessment of deficits for the 1999 financial year, to be published in March 2000, is already being prepared according to the new ESA, which means that the analysis will be based on consolidated aggregates that are relevant from an economically significant point of view. However, let me also briefly use this debate to appeal to all governments and political parties to do everything possible to ensure that the excessive deficit procedure never has to be initiated. It is good that the procedure exists. The procedure is necessary because it gives our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility. Citizens are asking: what if the criteria are not met? With these procedures and other measures, we can demonstrate that we are serious about the criteria and about ourselves. A second essential point is the question of whether we must do everything in our power not only to prevent excessive deficits, but also to further reduce public deficits. I know what I'm talking about, and let me conclude by saying why I'm so glad we're having this debate! In my own country, we're currently having a debate about whether the figures given by the former finance minister about the deficit actually reflect reality. In my own country, Austria, new elections were necessary in 1995 to meet the Maastricht criteria and to persuade our political partners to rethink their position. I must also say that in 2000, when so much is being said about us, the coalition negotiations with the SPÖ—I say, unfortunately—failed because the negotiated austerity and consolidation program was overturned by the Socialist Party. Not least of all, the new government had to be formed in Austria because the ÖVP wants to continue to be a guarantor of the stability course, because the ÖVP wants to continue to ensure compliance with the Maastricht criteria and the reduction of the public deficit, as we have agreed here. Mr. President, it is gratifying when statistical data are not only reliable but also comparable. This is of great importance, above all, for European integration and the completion of the internal market. That is why we have before us a politically substantial report, for which we sincerely congratulate the rapporteur. The report also gives rise to a number of political observations. The Stability Pact is a fact in Europe. With this Stability Pact, all countries participating in the euro have committed themselves to striving for a budget that is balanced or has a small surplus in the medium term. This does not mean, of course, that it cannot be somewhat more or less in the event of an unfavorable economic trend, but in the long and medium term, there must be a balance or a surplus. The more consolidated the position of the participating countries becomes, the stronger the euro will be. This means that exceeding the three percent norm will rarely occur, even under unfavorable economic conditions, or so the argument goes.	de
The Atlantic coast's two most important resources, fishing and tourism, are both severely affected. The season will most likely be loss-making, which would lead to a serious crisis at the end of the year. It is therefore entirely justified for our Parliament to adopt a new resolution, to which our group has made a very substantial contribution. It highlights several points that are considered to be of absolute priority on the ground. The first is that the polluter must accept full responsibility. Our resolution calls for the application of two principles. First, the principle that the polluter must pay for clean-up, because it is unacceptable that the clean-up of coastal areas polluted by a tanker's cargo should be borne not by the owner of the cargo, but by the local authorities, the taxpayers, the victims. Second, the application of the polluter pays principle. The polluter's responsibility, our resolution calls for, must also extend to fishing, marine culture, and aquaculture companies. This is of fundamental importance and implies that the polluter cannot limit the amount of compensation paid to those affected by the ceiling set by FIPOL, that is, at the arbitrary discretion of the major oil companies. If the FIPOL ceiling is insufficient—and it is clearly too low—it must be increased. This is also what our resolution calls for. If the increase is still insufficient, the polluter must bear the remaining damage himself. It would be highly unjust for an oil company, which has made 10 billion francs in profits this year, to refuse to pay 100% compensation to its victims, the vast majority of whom are small businesses and employees. The suffering population, Commissioner, awaits concrete signs of solidarity at Community level. Our resolution calls on the Commission to take the necessary measures to help repair the damage in the fishing sector affected by the disaster. Blue Europe, the CFP, must make it clear today that, in addition to the constraints they impose on fishermen, solidarity is not an empty phrase for them. The European Union must also contribute to restoring the natural environment in the affected wetlands and coastal zones, which are of biological importance to the Union as a whole. Mr Fischler has just announced that he will welcome requests from France, which I can only welcome. We must play a pioneering role on this important issue of marine pollution. Twenty years after the Amoco Cadix disaster, negligence and irresponsibility still prevail in Europe, with new oil spills as a result. This time, inertia must be overcome. A general framework for maritime safety must be established without delay, taking into account the principle of subsidiarity, and the vicious circle of widespread irresponsibility must be put to an end. Mr President, the economy of the French Atlantic coast has been seriously damaged by the oil pollution resulting from the Erika accident. Fishermen, shellfish farmers, oyster farmers, tourism operators and local and regional authorities are eagerly awaiting aid and the removal of the wreck, which is apparently still leaking oil and is therefore a veritable time bomb.	de
The truth is that the European Parliament still fails to earn the trust or even the interest of national public opinion, which persists in not thinking about Europe, as evidenced by the level of abstention in the recent elections. Therefore, what is needed is to strengthen the mechanisms used for cooperation between the governments of the Member States, giving them greater coherence, transparency, and a more democratic character. We welcome Romano Prodi's efforts to improve the Commission's public reputation and the need for it to reach agreement with the EP and the Council. However, we believe that the priority should be the reform of the mechanisms for governmental cooperation, particularly through the creation of a Council of Ministers for Europe which, in coordination with each other and with the other European institutions, would be responsible for transforming the political decisions of the European Councils into concrete actions. Corrie Report (A5-0032/2000) Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1999 was marked by increased concern about the continuity of the cooperation model resulting from the Lomé Agreements. Already in 1994, through an initial resolution that enjoyed the broad participation of our colleague Domique Souchet, the Joint Assembly expressed alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which had come into conflict with the very principle of Community preference, which is essential for such cooperation. For the past two years, these fears have materialized. The banana dispute is the clearest expression of this. Developing countries are being asked to adapt to trade liberalization, despite the fragility of their economies. While Mr. Corrie's report rightly denounces this situation and reaffirms the Joint Assembly's commitment to the Lomé model, it does not sufficiently emphasize a second problem, which, in fact, also stems from the free trade error: the inconsistency of the regional trade agreements concluded by the European Union. The Cooperation Agreement with South Africa is the best example of this. The Council approved this agreement, negotiated by the Commission, when even the agricultural chapter, which is essential, was not finalized. As our colleague Paul-Marie Coûteaux rightly pointed out in his speech yesterday and in his proposed amendments, one wonders what the political coherence of this blank check is. This is very worrying, especially when a similar agreement seems to be on the horizon with Mexico. Nor can we support the rapporteur when he calls for the incorporation of the European Development Fund into the Community budget. We wish to maintain the clear commitment and responsibility of each Member State that the intergovernmental nature allows. Unfortunately, there are too many examples of collective aid being diverted for which no one feels responsible, and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the EDF. Madam President, I welcome Mr. Corrie's report because it represents a balanced assessment of the work carried out by the Assembly over the past year. The report comes to us just after an agreement was reached on the renewal of the current Lomé Convention, which expires at the end of this month.	es
There is no freedom without rules. We have ruled out so-called master-feeder structures. These feeder funds exist in the United States, but in an area with only one supervisory authority and a single jurisdiction. In the still fragmented European market, such structures would inevitably create problems. The Socialists, like the Commission, doubt the advisability of authorizing investment funds to also invest in so-called over-the-counter derivatives, products traded over-the-counter between professionals. Since these operations are generally not subject to prudential supervision, the risks are all the more obvious. In order to control the risks for investors, the Socialist Group has introduced amendments proposing safeguard clauses, both quantitative and qualitative. By adopting these amendments, Parliament will authorize the use of OTC derivatives, while limiting the risks for private investors. Mr. President, there is currently much talk about the principle of good governance. This principle should guide not only the public sector, but also the private sector, particularly financial companies. Mr. President, the objective we are pursuing in creating a framework for SICAVs and other UCITS is to ensure investors the best and safest possible return. This is why I want to address the issue of derivatives in my speech. I firmly believe that, used prudently, derivatives can provide safer and higher returns. Despite the risky image they inspire, derivatives are usually used by portfolio managers as a shield. A contract that pays out, for example, a large sum if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 stock index falls, results in an additional payment from the investor if it rises. Is this speculation? Absolutely not. Imagine that you have spent several months building a portfolio of shares in companies you have confidence in: they are well managed, have good prospects, and represent a worthwhile investment. Then you fear the occurrence of a stock market collapse as a whole, like the one in 1987. You have the option of liquidating everything for cash, but that would mean ruining the fruit of your research in favor of the winners. It would also involve all the transaction costs incurred by selling your shares and then buying them back after the market crash. The solution is to turn to a derivative that pays off in the event of a fall in the NASDAQ or the CAC 40. But a custom-made or over-the-counter derivative, which is less expensive and perhaps protects you against a relative loss of your portfolio compared to the index, still allows you to keep your portfolio and the shares, but also to protect you against the risks of a collapse. In exchange, you also give up the risks of market increases. In this case, which is perhaps the most common among portfolio managers who own derivatives, you reduce your potential gains but also your potential risks. This is a desirable development for a well-managed fund. Experience shows that investors benefit from a liberal and flexible approach to regulation.	fr
(The sitting, adjourned at 1:05 p.m., resumed at 3:00 p.m.) Oil spill in France The next item is the Commission statement on the oil spill in France. I now give the floor, on behalf of the Commission, to Mrs. de Palacio to open the debate. Mr. President, I am speaking on behalf of the EPP, but also in my capacity as an elected Breton, directly affected and appalled by these events. Together with Françoise Grossetête and the EPP, we have tabled a motion for a resolution. Here we are today with a compromise motion, which I am pleased about. The sinking of the Erika is truly a European issue, on the one hand, because it mutilates and litters some of the most beautiful European beaches, with very serious consequences for tourism, seafarers, and environmentalists, and on the other, because what is at stake is regulation and control, which have a clear European dimension. Such a catastrophe, almost certainly, would not have occurred off the coast of the United States. Why? Because the Americans learned the lesson of the Exxon Valdez disaster and because in 1990 they enacted the Oil Pollution Act, which has a broader scope of responsibilities, because it can involve the liability of the charterer, is more binding, and above all, is better controlled through various regulations and, in particular, due to the existence of the United States Coast Guard. Without such provisions, I repeat, the catastrophe would undoubtedly not have occurred. That is why we believe it is necessary to review the applicable texts and, in particular, the 1992 protocol, which has exonerated charterers, in this case the chartering tanker, from all liability. However, if the charterer is exonerated, it will certainly be less involved in the controls that are the responsibility of the oil companies. Therefore, the regulations must be reviewed, and I thank you, Commissioner, for pointing out all the current shortcomings of the European provisions. Furthermore, as you have said, we must above all strengthen controls: controls by the flag state and those of the classification societies. You have told us that RINA is an Italian classification registry recognized by the Commission. Under what conditions is this recognition carried out? What are the guarantees of reliability? The Commission will send a mission. We await the results with great interest. We must also strengthen controls by maritime authorities and controls in European ports. It should be remembered that there is a Paris Memorandum that requires a minimum of controls: a quarter of the ships calling at European ports must be controlled by the maritime authorities of the country in question. This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries. Why is this? What consequences has the Commission drawn or intends to draw from this situation? I also consider it necessary to strengthen the control of the charterer, in this case, the oil tanker.	es
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Commissioner Patten and express my appreciation for the remarks he has made here today, in particular in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process, and for reiterating that our role is not just that of ""banker"" to the whole operation. I was deeply disappointed to hear this week about the suspension of talks between Israel and Syria. I very much hope that a compromise can be found to overcome this obstacle so that peace negotiations can resume as soon as possible. However, we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East recently. The fact that, for the first time in their respective histories, the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister recently sat around the same table in the United States is a sign that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome. Political leaders must show real courage to create conditions that can lead to a comprehensive peaceful solution in the Middle East. I know that even if an agreement between Syria and Israel is possible, the Israeli Prime Minister will still face strong opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum. The settlers in the Golan Heights will demand compensation and security guarantees will have to be provided. If Syria is willing to offer concessions on the security issue, the prospects for a successful resolution of the Israel/Syria issue could be promising. On the Palestine issue, I recognize that there are still some difficulties in implementing certain aspects of the Wye Plantation agreement. The main problems at present include the difficulties of troop withdrawal, as well as the transfer of land. The small number of Palestinian prisoners released and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to be willing to suspend work on building permits already granted, as well as to refuse to issue new permits, pose further obstacles. These issues have clearly slowed down any progress in the negotiations on the final status, although I believe these talks cannot be postponed indefinitely. For the time being, the main difficulty in negotiating seems to be that the Palestinians insist that the border issue must be agreed upon first, while the Israeli government says that it should be settled only after the settlement and security issues have been resolved. Currently, both sides seem to have recognized that nothing will be agreed upon until everything is agreed upon. In conclusion, while other countries in the Middle East have expressed reservations about the overall direction of the peace process, now that the Syrian government has been involved, Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward. I sincerely hope that, in the interest of improving the security and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East, all key players will move forward quickly in the immediate future so as to reach a comprehensive agreement on all the key issues that need to be resolved."	it
As for the questions and problems raised by the Members, I have summarized them in four areas. First, the expansion of the thematic areas. There are four, as in the employment strategy: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability, and equal opportunities. We agree with the expansion of these thematic areas in accordance with the proposals put forward by Parliament. Furthermore, the concern has been expressed that a country might use all of its resources for only one of the categories affected by discrimination. I would like to respond to this by saying that the initiative clearly states that Member States must propose a thematic action for each group affected by discrimination. The second point is flexibility and simplification. I agree with Ms. Lynne—the initiative is truly written in very complicated and extremely cumbersome language. The services are therefore already in the process of reviewing the text, streamlining it, and making it more understandable. As far as flexibility is concerned, we propose development partnerships and cooperation, both at the geographical level, where different groups in a specific geographical area work together to eliminate discrimination in the labor market, and at the thematic level, meaning that cooperation can take place, for example, in a specific economic sector. Member States have considerable scope here to adapt development partnerships to their own particular circumstances. This is, of course, conditional on effective cooperation between Member States and on networking to promote the exchange of experience. Finally, I would like to mention technical assistance. We are endeavoring to ensure that four aspects can be financially supported: first, preparation; second, implementation; third, interoperability to encourage the exchange of experience; and fourth, technical assistance. Since there have been numerous comments on this topic and considerable interest in how technical assistance is provided, I would like to point out that external offices will be used for this purpose. As Mr Barnier has already explained, Commission staff cannot handle all the work that has previously been done by external staff alone. The aim is to set up large action groups at national and European level, to be put out to tender, and to obtain a full description of the project requiring external assistance and a detailed description of the product we expect from the TAO, so that the work can be monitored and evaluated. Let me stress the importance of pushing ahead with this initiative as quickly as possible, both in view of the political circumstances and because we consider it essential that it get off to a good start and that we are therefore fully prepared by the end of 2000. Thank you very much, Commissioner. I will convey to my colleagues in the Bureau and the relevant committees your wish for the rapporteurs to be appointed promptly for the dossiers you have mentioned. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. (The sitting closed at 8.40 p.m.) Approval of the minutes of the two previous sittings The minutes of the sittings of Thursday, 3 February, and Monday, 14 February, have been distributed. The minutes of February 3 have already been distributed in Brussels. Perhaps that's why some colleagues haven't received them yet.	de
Water is a renewable and limited natural resource. It becomes scarce when it is not well managed and when geographical and climatic conditions are unfavorable. In the Union, this issue is of decisive importance in the Mediterranean region, but also in other European countries, where we are witnessing the progressive drying up of wetlands. Delicate, humid, or arid zones, inequalities between States, inequalities between different regions within States, climatic, economic, geographical, and geological specificities—these are all examples we wish to highlight, but which should not, however, lead to distortions of competition within the Community. However, we have tabled amendments to emphasize the importance of the specific relationship between agriculture and water, a key factor in land use and valorization. There is no doubt that the needs of agriculture in the South are far greater, so this framework directive must take this specificity into account. Furthermore, solutions to these problems are not only being sought in the Member States of the Union: in October, the countries of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in Turin resolutely called for a Marshall Plan for water on the southern shore of the Mediterranean. Fortunately, we are not in that situation. However, in Europe there are droughts, desertification in certain regions, but also floods, as the directive clearly underlines. We have recently experienced them in France, and also in the Rhine Valley and Central Europe. We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy, which must make the different uses of water compatible. But it is necessary to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management. In any case, the water issue will not be concluded today. Indeed, the issue of enlargement and climate change open up new perspectives. Mr. President, good-quality water may acquire even greater strategic importance than oil in this century. This is reason enough to thank Ms. Lienemann for her dedication to maintaining surface waters in good condition. Adopting an appropriate European legislative framework seems rather complicated. With the Water Framework Directive, we aim to put an end to the dispersion of legislation on this matter across the Union. However, despite everything, we have not been able to prevent the directive from being long and complicated. This requires the bodies responsible for its implementation to be very careful in its application. In particular, we must take advantage of the possibilities offered by the river basin approach to implement a specific policy by Member States and bodies responsible for water management. The most important objectives remain combating surface and groundwater pollution, protecting ecosystems, promoting sustainable water use, combating floods and droughts, and ending the discharge of hazardous substances into surface waters. Regarding the discharge of substances into surface waters, I believe the Council's objectives are too uncommitted and too unambitious. I find the current proposal from the Environment Committee to reduce discharges to near-zero levels commendable and worthy of support.	es
"Thirdly, we welcome the fact that the common position has introduced, for the first time, the development and regional planning of coastal areas among the priorities of LIFE ""environment"". However, Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, despite all its merits, the LIFE III regulation fails in the area which is necessarily the most important for a financial instrument: its budget. By maintaining their proposal of EUR 613 million as the reference amount for the period 2000-2004 and by not taking into account the European Parliament's proposal of EUR 850 million, the Commission and the Council are taking a decision which, in our view, no longer meets the fair and rational criteria which they had rightly introduced into the other provisions of LIFE III. As far as we are concerned, the Commission and the Council should know that we will not abandon our intention to provide LIFE with the budget it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results which such an instrument aims to achieve. We justify our opinion on the basis of four very simple arguments. First, LIFE is the only direct financial instrument intended to promote the environment in the European Union. There is no other. Second, LIFE is an instrument that has produced good results, has enabled the development of innovative methods and techniques, and its implementation rate is excellent. Third, the LIFE budget has declined in real terms and has not kept pace with the dynamism and creativity of demand. Fourth, given the credit it grants to LIFE, the European Parliament has earmarked increasingly large allocations for this programme in its annual budget. Therefore, approval of the proposal put forward by the Commission and the Council would lead to an unacceptable reversal of this trend. However, our concern is not only about the budgetary issue. Climate change and water policy are issues of great concern to European citizens and have received sustained attention from the European Parliament. This is why, in our view, it is essential to approve our Amendments 5 and 6, which aim to make the sustainable management of groundwater and surface water, as well as the reduction of greenhouse gases, objectives of LIFE ""environment"". A final word to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her report and to inform her that we will vote in favour of her amendments on comitology, because, although we prefer, as has become clear in the Environment Committee, that LIFE be monitored by an advisory committee, we do not wish to contribute to the adoption of the Council's solution, which is decidedly less good. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE is the most important instrument, the only financial instrument, in fact, of the European Union that is exclusively devoted to the environment. This shows that this tool must be equal to our ambitions, ambitions that come at a price, of course."	fr
But, regardless of that, we would like to emphasize that strengthening the coherence of European Union policies within the current framework and in the current situation the Union is experiencing presupposes serious reflection on certain aspects related to the dynamics of the European Union itself: certainly, the internal dynamics of the European Union. We know that the European Union experiences its own dynamics, stemming above all from the Treaty of Amsterdam, which strengthens its political dimension, which certainly has an important consequence regarding the premise of policy coherence in the area of development. We will also have to wait for the development of the Intergovernmental Conference to see what dynamics are adopted with respect to enlargement, in order to verify to what extent the internal dynamics of the European Union are oriented toward strengthening the coherence of its policies and, particularly in the area of development, contribute to appropriate institutional arrangements also with a view to that objective. The second aspect to consider regarding policy coherence: development policy within the framework of the Union's foreign policy. We know that the Union is experiencing a new dimension in its foreign policy. We know that with the creation of the High Representative, the Rapid Intervention Force, and the Military Crisis Management Center, there is a whole dynamic of affirmation for the European Union that we cannot underestimate when addressing the role of development policies. We also know that there are aspects related to political dialogue, the adoption of common positions or actions, the preparation of common strategies, preventive diplomacy, and the development of regional capacities for crisis prevention and management. There is no doubt that all these aspects, in their implementation and development, will undoubtedly make important contributions to strengthening the role of development policies within the framework of the European Union's foreign policy. We must say that, also at this level, at the level of the European Union, the framing of development policy within the framework of foreign policy will undoubtedly have to follow the same path as development policies in many Member States, within the framework of their foreign policies. This affirmation necessarily presupposes the need to strengthen decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures for CFSP resources, which allow for better coordination between the instruments of development policy and those of foreign policy. In this context, we are convinced that we need to move from a postcolonial to a European paradigm of development policy, knowing, as we do, that in the latter, such policy has been heavily conditioned by the policies of some Member States, based on their postcolonial references. The third aspect to consider: the policies of the European Union and those of the Member States. Policy coherence at the European Union level undoubtedly presupposes better coordination between Member States' policies and that of the European Union in the area of development, and if it were not possible to establish better mechanisms for coherence between national policies, it would undoubtedly be more difficult to reflect on a framework for greater coherence for European Union development policy.	es
Amendment 4 specifies that the purpose of the exercise is the assessment of fishery resources in general. Amendment 7 calls on the Commission to report annually on the use made of the data collected in accordance with the regulation. It is also intended to give greater impetus to the process through more rapid and frequent reporting by the Commission on the progress of the data collection program in general. The other area of concern relates to the range of data that must be collected in accordance with the regulation. First, with regard to economic data, Amendment 2 introduces two amendments. One seeks to ensure that the data requested are not more detailed than necessary, so that they serve the intended purpose. The other replaces a reference to profits from sales and other income, subsidies, interest received, etc., with only a reference to sales volume. It is considered that without these amendments, Member States could incur excessively high and undesirable costs in the data collection exercise, and that serious confidentiality problems could arise. In conjunction with these modifications, Amendment 5 removes a reference to the corresponding accounting headings. Secondly, with regard to environmental data, the original proposal refers only to biological and economic information. The Commission, however, has made it clear that it intends to conduct studies and pilot projects with a broader environmental focus. It has also clarified that it may wish to expand the range of data collected by Member States at a later stage. Amendment 3 brings within the scope of the current regulation the types of data needed to monitor changes occurring in aquatic ecosystems. This will undoubtedly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation on environmental data and may even make it unnecessary. It should be emphasized that the amendment in no way requires the Commission to include the collection of this type of data in either the minimum or extended program it establishes in due course. It simply contemplates the possibility for the Commission to do so if it so wishes. As already stated, the proposed Council decision is divided into two parts. The first relates to the financial participation in the expenditure incurred by Member States in the implementation of Community programs. The second is to allow the Commission itself to fund studies and pilot projects. There are some minor amendments: Amendment 2 seeks to ensure that the financial participation in the expenditure incurred by Member States can cover not only the costs arising from data collection, but also those related to its management, compilation, aggregated data, etc. Amendments 3 and 6 aim to make the deadlines more flexible, given that Member States will have to wait for the publication of the implementing regulation to know the exact content of the programs, as well as to adapt the deadlines to the dates and the regulation. Amendments 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is regularly submitted to the budgetary authority. More significantly, in Amendment 1, the Committee on Fisheries accepts the recommendation of the Committee on Budgets that funding should be placed under Heading 1(b), and not under Heading 3, of the Financial Perspective.	es
Finally, I would like to point out that since July, we have been calling for vigorous action from the Council and the Commission to secure the release of the 3,000 Kosovar prisoners, including Ms Brovina, Mr Kurti, and Mr Hoti. I note that the Union is preparing to lift certain sanctions, and in return, we have not had a single release of these prisoners. Why? Mr President, the events taking place in Mitrovica, Kosovo, are atrocious and unacceptable. Violence breeds violence, and revenge breeds revenge. The contingent of police forces sent is insufficient to prevent these massacres. Chief Police Commissioner Svend Frederiksen has expressed his despair, stating that he is still short of more than half of the promised troops. It has fewer than 2,000 officers, whereas it was promised nearly 5,000. The police force must be such that it is visible in the landscape, that the population believes that it can stop violations, and it must be of such a magnitude that it is able to shed light on the crimes committed and punish the guilty parties, otherwise the door is open to vigilantism. That is why local police officers must be trained, and it was planned that 2,000 to 3,000 officers would be trained, but the police force still has only 200 trained officers capable of contributing to investigative work. We already saw, a year ago, what happens when agreements reached and decisions taken are not respected. I was in Kosovo on October 27, 1998, at the time of the Serb withdrawal. It had been agreed that 1,800 OSCE observers would be sent there to guarantee peace. A month later, there were only a handful. By Christmas, there were perhaps 100, and by spring, there was still only a tiny fraction of the promised strength. The violations could not even be noted. Then came the war, and the observers withdrew. So my question is this, Commissioner: Can you really do nothing to prevent a repetition of our stupidities in Europe? Can you not guarantee a 5,000-strong police contingent and the training of local agents, who could obviously solve crimes more easily than foreign agents? I will add one further question: When do you think they will be in place? And when will you delegate more responsibility to local democratic forces? I ask this last question because it is the solution we must consider as quickly as possible so that peace has any chance of being established. Those who are in touch with the reality of Kosovo agree: a tragic and desperate situation of democratic vacuum and the impossibility of coexistence between the various ethnic groups - Mitrovica is a tragic example. The policy pursued by Milosevic in Kosovo before NATO's military intervention was certainly reprehensible, and the demands for autonomy for the regions of Kosovo emanating from the non-violent forces of the Rugova era were justified.	fr
In the future, funding will no longer come from three funds, but only from the EAGGF Guidance Section. It will therefore be necessary to improve the quality of the programs, as the EAGGF is intended to be an effective financial instrument. Greater precision in selection will lead to greater effectiveness, as money should not be wasted haphazardly. I would particularly like to emphasize the point that forms the basis for an integrated and environmentally sound development strategy. This sector holds great employment potential for the future in rural areas, and we must exploit it if we want to offer people in rural areas a future. Therefore, rural policy is more than just a policy for farmers. LEADER+ is intended to complement existing programs, avoid overlaps and double funding, and thus contribute to the most comprehensive development possible. In this way, LEADER+, together with the programs under Regulation 1257/99, can further underline the second pillar of the CAP and achieve the best possible impact for rural areas as a whole. Mr. President, Dear colleagues, I'm not always happy about this kind of hectic activity promoted by Parliament, but the URBAN program is one of the best examples, as it was created precisely at Parliament's initiative. The Commission would have discontinued URBAN, but in this case, Parliament had the upper hand. The continuation of the program is to be welcomed, as it has produced positive results at the local level. The problems facing Europe's urban areas are increasing. Fortunately, we now have an agreement with the Commission. A large proportion of Europe's population lives in cities. The resulting problems are important issues for regional policy, rooted in a variety of causes. The risk of infrastructural neglect is high. Many English and French cities already have slums where unbelievable deprivation prevail. None of us wants South American favelas in Europe. We must act now, before it's too late. Cities are also of great importance to the European economy. We keep encountering the same fundamental European problem: our economic life is insufficiently motivating individuals and is not dynamic enough. We need a strong economy so we can care for our fellow human beings and our environment. This isn't about politics, but about the simple logic of life. When it comes to using resources, it's a good idea to concentrate them, because too much of it ends up being wasted if we distribute it indiscriminately. We must now address the problems of small and medium-sized towns, as they lack sufficient critical mass. This would also allow us to accelerate the development of the surrounding rural areas. It is often forgotten that the problems of towns and rural regions are interrelated. One basis is always the task of promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, as the mass movement emanating from individuals renews a region from within. Granting financial aid without an economy already standing on its own two feet would be like pouring water on a well: drinking water would be available for the moment, but tomorrow the well will be dry again.	de
We cannot rule out accidents 100 percent, but prevention must be optimal and in this sense the coherent directive we are considering is an important step. I hope that my Liberal colleagues will consider between now and tomorrow whether - also for reasons of parliamentary identity - they will give us their vote at second reading, as they did at the first, because we will have to go to conciliation anyway and that will be where the Council's willingness will be seen. I believe that tomorrow we should approve the amendments by a large majority as they were discussed in committee, for environmental reasons and also for reasons of competition, but also in line with what we decided two months ago in January. Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, my compliments on your report. As you have just said, this directive is of the utmost urgency. Ports will be required to have waste collection facilities and the necessary checks will finally be carried out. Furthermore, and very importantly, Member States will have to impose fines in the event of non-compliance. All this will benefit the environment. The first investments are already being made, even before the directive comes into force. For example, a large new plant is being built in Antwerp, near where I live. In a certain sense we can say that the directive is already having an effect. There is only one point on which our opinions differ, as Mr Jarzembowski also pointed out, and that is on the method to be applied for allocating costs. No one is opposed to the principle that the polluter must pay. But the question is whether he should automatically pay the full amount by integrating it into high anchorage fees, or whether it would not be better to opt for the flexible rule proposed by the Council. It remains to be seen which of the two systems integrates the best economic incentive. I have had the opportunity to speak to several people about this and I must say that the positions are quite divergent, as are the habits. Different systems and percentages are even used in different ports in the same region. There are also ports that, if I may say so, change percentages at the last minute. I therefore believe that this Parliament should not be fixated on a fixed percentage. A flexible system under these conditions, as you said, must include a substantial contribution to the costs, and 0.01 percent is clearly not a substantial contribution. It must also be an encouragement, since part of the system remains flexible and open, so that it can operate in an environmentally friendly way, provided that the Commission exercises the necessary controls and ensures that the system works. If the objectives of the directive are not achieved, you, Commissioner, must intervene with the Commission and propose the necessary changes to ensure that the system works. Ladies and gentlemen, it is our duty to save this directive at all costs, we must not let it slip away. I hope that we will not jeopardise the entire directive just because of a question of principle relating to one point.	it
The common position, adopted by the Commission and subsequently confirmed by the Committee on the Environment, but which was accepted with great difficulty by the Council, meets environmental requirements in every respect, so I find it very strange and incomprehensible that members of the Committee on the Environment should have tabled amendments aimed at reducing environmental requirements and mitigating the liability of car manufacturers. If these amendments are adopted, I believe that the Assembly's credibility in environmental matters will be seriously undermined. The Assembly has so far played a positive role as a catalyst for environmental protection, but adoption of the amendments by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange would be a negative factor for environmental protection in Europe. On the other hand, if we mitigate the liability of producers in this case, this will have serious consequences in cases that we will examine later in other areas, for example, with regard to the future directive on electronic and computer waste. That is why I warmly recommend that Members disregard their affiliation to any particular group and vote against all amendments to the common position that seek to weaken environmental standards and restrict manufacturers' liability. That is how we will achieve a worthwhile environmental result. Mr President, this excellent directive will put an end to the dumping of old cars, encourage recycling and, above all, encourage manufacturers to design cars that can be easily recycled. The key is to decide who pays the costs. Whichever system is adopted, the price will ultimately be passed on to consumers. The best way to achieve our environmental objectives is to make manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for the disposal and recycling of cars. The manufacturers have, through subterfuge, persuaded Mr Florenz and Mr Lange to propose amendments that seriously weaken these proposals. Don't be fooled by the car manufacturers! If you want to fully benefit from this directive, use your vote to reject these amendments. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate, contrary to what we might think, is not technical. It has become eminently political. Yesterday, we honored our institution with a political debate. Today, if 314 Members were to give in to the power of the lobby of certain car manufacturers, we would dishonor ourselves. By asking consumers to cover half the cost of taking back end-of-life vehicles, as stipulated in Amendment 38, while the common position requires that the entire cost of taking back vehicles be borne by the manufacturer, for the first time, Parliament would not be presenting itself as the guarantor of the defense of consumers and European citizens; it would become, in a way, a sounding board for the lobbies. We cannot accept this. This would set a precedent that would leave the door open to all kinds of pressure in many other areas. It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would weaken a Council position, whereas I believe that we generally criticise the Council's position.	fr
This approach to involving all European institutions and citizens is transparent and effective. This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement poses for us. It requires us to reexamine the functioning of all our institutions, to reexamine our policies—all our policies—and, above all, to reexamine what we should continue to do at Union level when we have 25 or 30 Member States, and what it will be more appropriate to do at national, regional, and local government level. But enlargement is not the only factor pushing us to this new thinking. As I have just said, the globalization of the economy and of politics itself is also forcing us to do so. We must govern Europe in such a way as to be more effective, closer to citizens, by promoting the participation of everyone, starting first and foremost with the major problem of female participation. One of the major differences that emerged in the comparison made during this period between Europe and the United States is not so much the mobility of workers or the problem of venture capital, but rather the participation of women in economic life, a much higher participation in the United States than in our country. This is an area where Europe has always been at the forefront and we must conduct a deep, open reflection, and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to think about their own role, their own policies. We will therefore immediately return to work on this White Paper, even if we will have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference to complete it. It will therefore not be possible to present it before the spring of 2001. It will not be a book of philosophy, but a concrete book, rich in precise proposals. We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must completely review our organization. This is why we will do two things: we will work and are already working completely to initiate internal reform, and we will thoroughly re-examine our policies. I have asked all Commissioners - and we will reiterate this request in an even more analytical manner - to define all the activities that can be abandoned. The Commission must determine its core activities, those on which it must concentrate, and hand over non-core activities to others so as to free up new resources and achieve a more correct relationship and greater cooperation with countries, regions and local communities. We will therefore free up other resources, but the time will come - I fear, and I want to say this here before you - when these resources that we are already freeing up will no longer prove sufficient to enable us to face our new responsibilities. I am thinking of enlargement, the new sector of justice and home affairs, health and environmental issues. When we have spent all our resources, I will not hesitate to come and ask you for more, but I am saying today that we will not accept new tasks if the financial means to carry them out do not follow because there would be no coherence between the missions to be accomplished and the resources available.	fr
"Another example: cocoa. The European Union wants to allow 5 percent alternative fats in chocolate in order to harmonize the internal market. This percentage could be zero, and the internal market would still be harmonized. But setting this quota at 5 percent - that seems to be the basic orientation - would almost certainly harm hundreds of thousands of farmers in developing countries who grow cocoa. And yet, it really seems that we want to go in that direction. I wonder if we really realize what we are doing. This is a typical example of a policy that makes our fellow citizens say: what are they doing there in Brussels? It seems that the interests of European companies are more important than our principles, our coherence and the interests of developing countries. Even with regard to countries subject to sanctions or embargoes, there are shocking cases to be cited. Why, for example, was a decision taken to boycott petroleum products against Haiti but not against Burma, where the elected President is under arrest, the Parliament has been removed from office and some of its members have been imprisoned or even murdered? Why was a boycott not imposed on petroleum products against Sudan, where even today there are clashes involving weapons - mind you - paid for with the money of the oil companies working in the regions where the refugees are located? The inconsistency of such a policy is truly scandalous. This morning Commissioner Nielson has once again shown us a positive example in relation to the Lomé Convention. If we apply the new Lomé Convention without first purging our policy of all its inconsistencies, the Union's policy will be built on sand, to use a biblical expression. The Council has never tired of repeating, time after time, the areas in which things were not going well: agriculture, trade, conflict prevention, peacekeeping operations, fisheries, migration, the environment. Commissioner Nielson, what we are waiting for is a comprehensive report on the inconsistencies between our policies and some concrete proposals to remedy these inconsistencies, because otherwise it will happen again that all your fine examples, all your splendid policies - and I say this also to the Secretary of State - will be built on sand and will therefore not be able to last for long. It is the citizens who are asking for it, and we ourselves have been demanding it since 1992: that is the real subject of today's debate. I hope that our message will be well received by you and I very much hope that you will return here shortly to submit a report and concrete measures. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully share the spirit of Mrs Maij-Weggen's speech and I believe that the representatives of the other institutions present here are all sincerely willing to delve into this issue in precisely that spirit. This is a subject of fundamental importance for the European Union. To begin with, I would like to clarify what we are discussing. Article 178, Title XX of the consolidated version of the Treaties on the Union states: ""In implementing policies which are likely to have consequences for developing countries, the Community shall take into account the objectives set out in Article 177"". And what are these objectives that any European Union policy must take into account?"	it
Ireland supports the common position and many of the European Parliament's amendments. A period of 25 years for the implementation of legislation is hardly acceptable. We have no problem with the enforcement of the polluter pays principle to cover the costs of industrial, commercial, and agricultural water use. However, since water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, I firmly believe that this directive must provide for a basic free water supply to private households, that is, a certain quota per household for water for drinking, cooking, and sanitation purposes. Of course, we have to pay for waste and over-consumption, and cost recovery can be adjusted accordingly. In Ireland, where private households have not paid water charges since 1997 and therefore no longer have water meters, the introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion. Measuring water consumption could be a very important water management tool within the new river basin districts, helping to prevent water wastage and to systematically plan for future needs. The purpose of the directive is to promote the sustainable, environmentally sound use of water in the EU. Water is a scarce and valuable natural resource. I would ideally prefer it if Amendment 45 were not adopted tomorrow and the common position on Article 9 were to apply to water charges as well. This would ensure subsidiarity in setting water charges, and each Member State could set up its own system, provided the principles of this directive regarding incentives for sustainable, environmentally sound and efficient water use are fully respected. If Amendment 45 is not adopted tomorrow, I must table an oral amendment to ensure that Member States have the option of granting derogations from the provisions of this article, thus allowing a minimum quantity to be made available for household use before the cost-recovery requirement applies. All regulations must be enforceable and based on the general principle of political acceptance. I consider access to clean drinking water to be a fundamental human right in both developed and developing countries. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this stage of the debate, I would like to highlight a few aspects of this directive which, from an agronomic perspective and given my origins in a southern country, I consider to have extremely significant consequences. For example, the issues of costs and transfers. As for costs, I would like to know exactly what costs we are talking about. Are we talking about the distribution and origin of resources? Are we talking about the quality of distribution networks? Are we talking about the type of civil engineering works required to supply water? Or are we talking about large-scale hydraulic works and reservoirs? It would be barbaric to pass the entire cost on to the agricultural sector. As for transfers, these are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas. Is the Commissioner aware that our country has a transfer system that is one of the oldest in Europe? These transfers existed in very early times: they already existed in Roman times, but they were on a smaller scale.	de
"In the meantime, we must give the Commission a vote of confidence. ""Long-winded."" I don't want to dwell on the length of this report here. I don't know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions tabled here, but in any case, and without a doubt, it does for this type of resolution. I don't think there has ever been a resolution in the past—and bear in mind that we draft complex resolutions in this Parliament—that contained paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single point. Moreover, it is ""unclear."" I don't want to go back to what was said about the analysis of the issues that concern Parliament. That should be the subject of another report that we will have to draft, and it is necessary to reflect on it, but not in this report. And finally, frankly, Mr President, I don't want to cite examples, but there are many in which legal language is used with alarming imprecision. Therefore, and I will summarize, I await your report, Commissioner Kinnock—there are many of us waiting—so that we can comment on it, because that is precisely Parliament's task. Mr. President, the scope and the sheer volume of detail in the proposals for necessary reform steps indicate the importance of such a reform. However, given the events that triggered these efforts, the necessity is also obvious. Hopes and expectations were all the more aroused by the strong announcements made by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control. The concept of transparency is particularly striking in the report. Ensuring this is a key concern. The importance of fully traceable work cannot be overemphasized. But this is not just about bureaucratic reform; it is much more about demonstrating goodwill towards the citizen. Their trust in EU policy must be regained. Citizens demand rapid and open access to the institution and legibility of the regulations. He draws his understanding from this, and he wants a policy of success, while simultaneously seeing this as a matter of course for the responsible citizen. The success of the reform depends crucially on the Commission's own initiative. However, it irritates me today to hear that the Commission now says it only wants to discuss the interim report informally with Parliament. Your presentation, Mr. Kinnock, in the Committee on Budgetary Control next Tuesday cannot be a one-way street; we as parliamentarians want and must help shape it. And it also goes against my political understanding if a press conference is held this week before we have thoroughly discussed the proposal in the relevant Committee on Budgetary Control. I believe, Mr. Kinnock, despite all my personal success, that the Commission still has a lot to do to meet our justified, high expectations. First, may I state for the record and as a statement for Ms. Langenhagen that the decision that I will not address the entire Parliament tomorrow and therefore will not be available for official questions about the report was made neither by me nor by the Commission – it was the decision of this Parliament!"	de
I would first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur, the chairman of the committee, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for examining the Commission's proposal. The Commission's proposal is, as some of you have pointed out, quite technical. However, its objective is quite simple: the harmonisation of procedures governing the authorisation of additives in food. At present, there is a difference in the treatment of authorisations, depending on whether the applications were submitted before or after 1 January 1988. The objective of the Commission's proposal is to harmonise these procedures in order to ensure that such differences no longer exist. The scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited. Five amendments have been tabled by Parliament. I regret that the Commission is unable to adopt these amendments, despite the fact that I am well aware of the views and commitment of Parliament, the Committee on Agriculture and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, to these issues. I intend to deal with each of the amendments separately. The first amendment proposes to change the legal basis of the proposal by substituting Article 152 for Article 37. I simply wish to point out that the Commission's proposal makes no reference to health and consumer protection. The technical nature of the proposed amendment does not allow it to be interpreted as having the protection of public health as its primary objective. I note that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also considers Article 37 to be the appropriate legal basis. I would remind Parliament that the primary objective of Article 152 is the protection of health. I recommend that you read the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee, which, in my view, describes the situation precisely, clearly and with commendable conciseness. Amendments Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission's proposal, as they seek to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives. I am the first to acknowledge that GMOs are a very important problem. I also acknowledge and concede that a number of initiatives are necessary to update EU legislation in the field of GMOs. However, this technical amendment is not the appropriate instrument for introducing such initiatives. The Commission is of the opinion that it is premature, at this stage, to amend the provisions currently laid down by Directive 70/524 on genetically modified additives. On the other hand, it is appropriate to await developments in the common position on the amendment to Directive 90/220, which is currently in its second reading in Parliament. The Commission intends to go much further than what is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments. I can also assure Parliament that I will ensure that the relevant provisions of Directive 90/220 are included in the proposal for a recast of Directive 70/524 which the Commission has put forward in the White Paper on food safety and which will be presented to Parliament before July 2001. I can also assure Parliament that all the remarks made today will receive our full attention. Amendments 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give unjustified preference to copies of products by giving them permission to be put on the market even before an application for authorization has been submitted.	fr
Therefore, as you can see, this is a very important project that truly helps the Member States of the Union provide themselves with a more comprehensive and uniform instrument for legal assistance. In reality, within the Council, there are still some disagreements regarding the type of agreement and certain clauses contained therein. Some of these disagreements have already been resolved; others still persist. The spirit of the proposal, in any case, is to provide legal professionals—judges first and foremost, but also the citizens concerned—with an effective operational instrument for combating crime, while respecting fundamental procedural guarantees and the general principles of human rights. This is why, despite the numerous gaps in the text, the provisions contained therein can be accepted—they can be, Mr. President—but on condition that they are appropriately amended to ensure its functionality for other legal professionals and its acceptability by citizens. For this reason, the Commission has submitted several amendments aimed at systematically rethinking the Council's proposal, suggesting a series of technical adjustments to make the text more harmonious and coherent with respect to the proposed modifications. These amendments can be summarized as a greater emphasis on the fundamental rights of defense and various technical modifications necessary to make a series of obscure and contradictory passages more comprehensible, as well as to delete the section referring to remote wiretapping, which still lacks, on the one hand, technical knowledge and, on the other, acceptability by the governments of the various Member States of the Union. The proposal, as formulated by the Council and subsequently amended by the Commission, provides for a convention based on three titles: the first provides guidelines for standardizing the procedures and formalities to be followed in letters rogatory; the second lists a series of specific requests for mutual legal assistance and establishes the formalities and procedures to be followed in relation to these mutual legal assistance actions; The third, finally, provides for and establishes the methods by which wiretaps can and should be carried out on citizens who are in a State other than their country of origin. Undoubtedly, Mr. President, international cooperation is necessary to combat both cross-border crime and crime within the State whose evidence is located abroad. However, a new convention must be drawn up as soon as possible, taking into account other, even more delicate, issues: the whole issue of double criminality and the issue of specialization, as well as the issue of the credibility of a Union State vis-à-vis the judicial authority of other Union States. These are, therefore, extremely important issues that we hope the Council will return to as soon as possible in order to issue a new opinion. Mr. President, with regard to many other points of the matter, I refer to the content of my written report.	es
To achieve the highest possible degree of success in achieving the objectives of these policies, it is necessary to coordinate and organize them on the basis of well-developed, intelligently crafted guidelines, I would say. Let us not forget that these policies, when effective, are also visible to European citizens, who benefit from them and see the immediate improvement in their quality of life. Let us also not forget that special attention will have to be paid to the most remote and island regions of the European Union, since, due to their geographical location, they face fundamental obstacles to their economic and social development—unless, of course, the Commission intends to build underwater bridges and tunnels to connect them to the European trunk. Finally, I would like to emphasize that structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility, so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thus respond to the new challenges and opportunities that arise with the arrival of the new millennium, for which we all wish the best. Mr. President, Mrs. Schroedter's report undoubtedly includes many important observations, and I congratulate her for this. I believe, however, that we should show more concern about the direction and results of the Community's regional policy. Broadly speaking, the enormous mass unemployment is not only not diminishing, but is actually worsening even further within the framework of structural policy. The agricultural economy and rural areas are irreparably affected by the regional policy being pursued, with dramatic consequences for rural employment and the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South. Regional inequalities are increasing dramatically within the Member States. If we examine the data from the sixth report, we will see that enormous deviations from the average regional development have been recorded over the last decade. Minimal, if not nonexistent, attention is being paid to the enormous problems of the Union's island regions, whose deficiencies in infrastructure, transport, communications, and energy inevitably lead to depopulation. Both regional policy and the Union's more general economic and social policy are responsible for all of this. Broad sectors of the Union's people strongly condemn this policy as dangerous and unpopular. The new guidelines unfortunately move in the same direction, and nothing suggests that this can change with the implementation of these guidelines. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say a few words here to underline two points that these reports remind us of and that are of essential strategic importance in our perspective of the Union. The first is the essential and fundamental importance we continue to attach to the principle of economic and social cohesion. And we express concern at the reports we are receiving that the importance of this objective is waning in the Commission's mind. We continue to consider economic and social cohesion to be a fundamental objective of the Union. Secondly, I agree with the words heard here from a Member on the issue of the islands, and I would also like to draw attention to the outermost regions. We would like to see more boldness in the future in addressing the issue of the outermost regions, such as, in the case of my country, the Azores and Madeira islands.	es
"Mr President, excuse me, but there was a small translation error in the French booth, regarding what Mr Alyssandrakis just said, on the most sensitive word in the whole debate. I would not like there to be any misunderstanding. The translation, in French, made Mr Alyssandrakis say that the ""confederal"" solution is the best, whereas it is clear that he spoke of a ""federal"" solution. It is extremely important to clarify this, Mr President. Many thanks for the clarification, Mr Wurtz. Mr President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of continental Europe. The Maltese in particular have been very good at surviving in hostile geographical and geopolitical conditions. Their success has depended largely on their spirit of initiative, their dynamism and their flexibility. Malta has a very vibrant heavy and light industry, expanding financial services, good agriculture, thriving tourism and an incredible variety of job opportunities, all on an island with virtually no natural resources. I am therefore sure that an island like Malta, with a population of 340,000, cannot adapt to the rigid economic and legal structures of continental Europe, which has a population thousands of times greater. When I look at the proposed instrument, I therefore do not see a measure that can bring two peoples into the bosom of Mother Europe. The situation is more like a black hole in space, which sucks masses into itself with such force that not even light can escape. We must not induce these island peoples to collaborate in their own destruction by offering them money to convince them to accept laws that are as alien to their culture as a black hole is to Mother Earth. The European Union must leave Malta and Cyprus alone. It seems to me that the only people who want this in Malta are the political class, and I cross my fingers that once again the Maltese will be the winners. Mr President, this is one of the rare occasions when the positions adopted by all parts of the House reveal the greatest convergence of views on the Cyprus question and on the pre-accession procedure for Cyprus and Malta. This means that there is a certain common awareness in all of us about the so-called political problem of Cyprus. At the same time, it means that it is to the great advantage of the Council and the Commission to ensure that this potential, expressed by all the parties and peoples of Europe, becomes the cornerstone of their political approach to solving the problem. Ladies and gentlemen, Helsinki represents a historic turning point and a new point of reference. It would be a tragic mistake if we now, for whatever reason, regarded the balance achieved in Helsinki as a starting point for new negotiations or if we undermined that balance by our attitude. The time is ripe: what is required of the Commission and the Council is a firm determination to follow up, without subterfuge, on the pre-accession negotiations with Cyprus and Malta - ultimately the most ready candidate countries of all - so that their resolve may serve as a warning to any party that may have an idea different from the one we all share."	it
"Following Oslo, a total of 17,400 hectares of land were expropriated by October 17, 1999, including 846.2 hectares under the new Barak government. Trees were uprooted, more houses were destroyed, and, especially in East Jerusalem, water access is restricted or denied, while settlement activity continues and the number of settlements continues to grow. However, the election of the new government undoubtedly marked positive steps; at least negotiations have resumed. However, there will be no stable and lasting peace in the Middle East if the Palestinians do not have their own state and cannot move freely within their territory. The international community must simply comply with UN Resolutions 332, 248, 245, and 194. We consider the suspension of relations with Syria worrying, as well as Prime Minister Barak's decision to postpone the Israeli troop withdrawal and the implementation of the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement. We believe it is essential that the European Union plays a political role in the negotiations commensurate with the economic aid it provides. We cannot be content with a supporting role; we must act as major players, without thereby entering into a conflict of interest with the United States, as Minister Gama said today. Mr. President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for his remarks today, particularly for his report on the role of the European Union in the peace process and his assurance that this role is not limited to that of ""financier"" for the entire operation. I was very disappointed when it was announced this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended. I sincerely hope that a compromise can be found regarding the existing problems so that the peace talks can resume as soon as possible. Nevertheless, there have been positive political developments in the Middle East recently. The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister recently sat at the same table for the first time in their respective histories during the talks in America shows that hatred and animosity, however ancient, can be overcome. The politicians in charge will need considerable courage to create a framework that can form the basis for a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East. I realize that even after an agreement between Syria and Israel is reached, the Israeli Prime Minister will face strong resistance to any further agreement with Syria in future referendums. The settlers in the Golan Heights will demand compensation and security guarantees. If Syria were willing to make concessions on the security issue, the prospects for a successful resolution of the problems between Israel and Syria would be good. Regarding the Palestinian issue, there are apparently still problems with the implementation of certain aspects of the Wye Agreement. Key issues at the moment include the difficulties surrounding troop withdrawal and the return of territory. The fact that few Palestinian prisoners have been released and the Israeli government's apparent reluctance to halt the implementation of previously granted construction permits and to refuse to issue new ones create further obstacles. These problems clearly hamper progress in the final status negotiations, although I don't believe they will delay these talks indefinitely."	de
"There are therefore two possible solutions: the directive is not applicable in Denmark, or the directive requires Denmark to introduce universally applicable agreements. Can the Commission confirm that the Posting of Workers Directive is not applicable in Denmark with regard to ""collective agreements declared universally applicable"" (see Article 3(1)), since such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law? If not, please explain how the directive applies to this point. The European Union Directive on the Posting of Workers stipulates that the mandatory rules regarding working and employment conditions in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country. This leaves two possibilities open: either the legislation of the host country applies, or the collective agreements declared universally applicable for a specific sector. Because Denmark does not have a system of universally applicable collective agreements, the legislation implementing the directive must, in addition to the working conditions established by law, also provide that universally applicable collective agreements concluded by the most representative organizations also apply to posted workers. In short, Denmark has two options: either introduce appropriate legislation, or, again through legislation, select a collective agreement that will be activated through legal channels. Discussions are currently taking place between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the transposition of this directive into national law. The deadline for replying to the Commission's questions expired on December 6, 1999. We have not received a reply. We are now awaiting the next steps. Thank you for the clear answer, which—if correctly interpreted—means that the directive on the posting of workers requires the Danish state to introduce a system of universally applicable agreements. While that is a clear answer, I would like to point out that this creates a very difficult political situation for Danish organizations, the Danish government, and the Danish parliament. As is well known, there are fundamental differences between the Danish system, which is largely based on collective bargaining, and the continental system, which is based on legislation. The disagreements and correspondence you refer to, Commissioner, primarily concern another directive, namely the Working Time Directive. A new letter of formal notice and a contractual procedure are therefore to be expected, since the Danish government does not intend to legislate and allow universally applicable collective agreements, or has expressly stated that it does not intend to do so. There is not the slightest intention of changing the system in force in Denmark or any other country. As I explained earlier, there are always difficulties in interpreting European Commission directives, both because they are framework-based and very general, and because the individual systems are designed very differently from country to country. The problem raised in your question does not only affect Denmark. There are still some unanswered questions, and not only there. Five countries have already implemented the legislation into national law, and the discussion process is ongoing in the others. Therefore, our goal—and this is why the consultations and discussions took place between the Commission and the Danish, as well as the other governments—is to find the best way to apply what has been agreed upon at the European level by all countries and constitutes a general framework to workers from other countries posted to Denmark."	de
This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy on which I expect us, Parliament, Commission and Council, to be in agreement. Cultural policy means, in particular, defending the role of creativity, recognizing authors and producing a demanding culture. Moreover, today, when Europe must adopt a new policy for copyright and related rights, it is urgent - this has just been emphasized several times - to define and redefine what an author is. We are still too vague in this regard and new technologies now require us to make this effort at clarification. Mr President, Commissioner, the advent of the WIPO Treaty has been a remarkable step towards a global information society. The legacy of decades-old copyright is crystallized in the treaties which represent a balanced and well-considered solution to the regulation of copyright and related rights. Beyond these recommendations, the entry into force of the treaty and its final form will, however, depend on the respective implementation of the parties. In the United States, the WIPO Treaty has already entered into force through the Digital Millennium Corporate Act, and this legislative measure has helped to safeguard the delicate balance of WIPO. The EU must also move forward with its legislative work in accordance with what was agreed at WIPO. It is therefore worrying that the positions taken by the previous Parliament do not support the balanced organization of WIPO. The first reading of the Copyright Directive was particularly aberrant, and, moreover, the balance is being shifted in the wrong direction from a European perspective. The proposed recommendations will not improve the position of culture in Europe—quite the contrary. The amendments proposed by Parliament would primarily improve the opportunities for media companies with a stable market position to transfer their former market shares of over 80 percent to a new environment with the help of rigid and excessive copyright regulations. I am therefore not speaking now of Mrs. Charlotte Cederschiöld's recommendation, which is an excellent document, but rather of the copyright-related topics that were addressed by the previous Parliament. As an isolated remark, I would therefore like to thank Mrs. Cederschiöld for clarifying, for example, the concept of so-called temporary copies in her opinion. The WIPO Treaty has not consciously taken a position on temporary copies. If these technical copies were to be included in the scope of protection, the transmission of data - as is quite rightly noted in the recommendation - would unnecessarily become expensive and complicated. It would be the same situation as if the postman had to pay royalties when he delivers a book to the customer who will read it. The real advantage of culture is the ability to transmit art and information, safely and effortlessly, directly from the artist to the user, to the consumer. Above all, the new framework for action represents an enormous opportunity to create and disseminate culture in new ways.	fr
Furthermore, requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without having to go through central authorities. There are essentially two types of provisions: those that create an obligation to provide assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and videoconferencing, controlled deliveries, and the interception of telecommunications; and those that do not create such an obligation but simply provide a legal framework for Member States wishing to cooperate in the manner described, such as the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert investigations, and the transmission and handover of procedural documents. The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions relating to new or modern investigative techniques. These are effective in combating the type of crime most likely to benefit from the opening of borders—organized crime. It is all too easy to be guided by the need to improve the efficiency of criminal investigations. However, one aspect must not be forgotten in all measures relating to criminal proceedings: the right to defense. I very much welcome the fact that Mr Di Pietro's report, to whom I pay the greatest respect for his excellent work, especially in such a short space of time, includes the right to a defence as a key point. At present, it is solely up to the Member States to ensure that these rights are respected under the scrutiny of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which work has just begun. We must admit that Article 18 is clearly a controversial decision. The article was carefully drafted in the Council through very lengthy discussions to ensure that intelligence activities remain effective and that criminal investigations are also covered. As far as criminal investigations, for which I am responsible, are concerned, I note the call from various Members of the European Parliament to the Commission and the Council to take this point into account and address it on a common legal basis, with reference to the relevance of telecommunications surveillance as potential evidence in court. The Commission is fully aware that the current draft is neither perfect nor ideal. But we must be realistic. The text is the result of a mixture of institutional structures envisaged for judicial cooperation in criminal matters under the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty, respectively. This is what we have before us now, and only practice will show us in detail whether and where there are deficiencies and what further steps need to be taken in the future. It is quite clear to me that the further development of mutual trust and reliability between the legal systems of the Member States will facilitate progress along the road ahead. That said, the Tampere European Council indicated the direction the Commission should take. The necessary steps will include the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the EuroJust project. The Commission sincerely hopes that its efforts to make progress in these important areas will have the support of the European Parliament.	de
"It's a disgrace! This figure of 167 million euros for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union! We are literally forced to strip theater groups, young musicians, avant-garde activities in the arts and literature, we ridicule them and we accept a single project in the face of thirty other rejections, so that Europe is perceived as a foreign factor, contrary, and adversary to any attempt at cultural achievement. The European Union must be present in this area, because the path we have chosen is not only that of the euro, or of enlargement or of geostrategic objectives. We must ensure that European unification also flourishes on a political level. It is a very sad situation. And as long as we continue to maintain the system of unanimity, and as long as, as yesterday, the Dutch government can impose these 167 million in a completely arbitrary manner, and as tomorrow, Mr Haider's government will tell us what our cultural activities will be, we will never be able to make progress. For this reason, it is essential for the Intergovernmental Conference to take certain important decisions so that the European Parliament's effort is freed from the commitments of each government and can give a significant cultural boost to the European area. Madam President, I fully share the opinions expressed by the rapporteur and I also thank the chairman of the Culture Committee, Mr Gargani, for the commendable work carried out in a substantially difficult mediation process. The need to simplify and strengthen the previous programmes was certainly felt, but we all wanted the Culture programme to effectively contribute to highlighting, for example, the particularities of each cultural sector, even - and I would even say especially - the lesser-known sectors, or better, precisely those. We hope this will happen at least on the evaluation scale. We strongly believe in the validity of cultural actions, also in terms of their contribution to the social and economic growth of a people. And Europe can rightly compete with the rest of the world by fully rediscovering its roots, highlighting the common cultural heritage, and worthily promoting and recovering the cultural and linguistic islands that have been little known until now. In the case of the great educational mission relating to the cultural dimension, a mission that the European Union must assume, one of the most obvious limitations of the program lies in the quantification of funding—we have heard this repeatedly—which denounces an insufficient awareness—at least on the part of the Council, not the Commissioner—of the importance of the cultural operation. The document that prioritizes the economic factor over social integration also testifies to this. With regard to the overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens, we believe that the ""Culture 2000"" programme, within the limits of its funding, can contribute to this great common objective. Madam President, I join this evening's unanimous movement and declare my support for the adoption of the Culture 2000 programme. Furthermore, I, too, thank the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, who has taken over from our former colleague, Nana Mouskouri."	fr
"However, an important merit of this summit, following Cardiff and Luxembourg, is that it demonstrates the political will to promote greater social cohesion, particularly for the 57 million people living in poverty in Europe, such as single mothers, large families, and children. To these will be added other socially excluded people in the future, namely those who will not have access to new areas of knowledge, which will lead to new social inequalities. A decisively forward-looking economic and social policy is therefore needed to prevent a gap between ""info-rich"" and ""info-poor""—that is, as one of my colleagues said earlier, a digital divide. For this reason, I believe that new technologies will only have a strong integrative impact on our growth if they are learned from childhood, since by 2010, half of all jobs will be in sectors directly related to information technologies. To this end, I recommend that the Lisbon Summit make three decisions: first, a strategy for lifelong learning and the establishment of an agenda to eradicate both economic and intellectual poverty among children; second, shaping European society with a view to the European Research Area; and third, establishing an open coordination procedure linked to our social and economic policies, complemented by a coordinated approach to the evaluation of national action plans. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, there is one idea in the Portuguese Presidency's declaration that I particularly like. This idea is the notion that the strength of our European economy lies in the capacity, imagination, and creativity—quite simply in the knowledge of the people in the European economic process. But if we take this seriously, if it is to become a genuine political program, then a policy of social inclusion requires no further justification, because social participation as such would be the strongest productive force in our common economy. If that is the case, Mr. President-in-Office of the Council, then we urgently need common goals. We need firm, measurable targets – both qualitatively and quantitatively – for increasing employment rates, as the Commission has now also proposed, for example. We need firm, consensually achievable targets for reducing the unemployment rate – as the Commission has now also proposed – to 4% in 2010. The logic that sees Ecofin ministers celebrating their consolidation successes at home while leaving responsibility for the issue of Europe's massive unemployment in the dark must end. I wish you strength, the support of Parliament, and the commitment to ensuring that this Parliament has more say in economic and employment policy in the future, as the citizens of Europe expect. Then you would have another ally for your policies. Mr. President, Mr. President-in-Office of the Council, Mr. President of the Commission, It is encouraging and promising when, as has been the case here, this plenary speaks of the new strategic objective for the coming decade: to make the European Union the most dynamic and competitive economic and social area in the world by building on new technologies, innovation and knowledge, so that we are able to raise the level of economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."	de
The Presidency mentions the sensitive issue of corporate tax and points out that there is indeed a significant impasse on this issue in the Monti package. I would like to reiterate my call for an in-depth analysis of developments in the area of corporate tax, especially within the Commission. I would also like to suggest that the Member States consider starting a Luxembourg process in this area because, reading the report, I see examples of best practices that could be addressed. I therefore ask that attention be paid to this point as well. Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, Mr. President of the Commission, much has already been said, and therefore, if we intervene at the end, there is a risk of repeating ourselves. However, I would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency for the document presented and the convincing speech delivered by the President of the Council. It is true—as President-in-Office Mr. Guterres has pointed out—that Lisbon does not plan to launch new initiatives, but rather to merge those of Luxembourg, Cardiff, and Cologne. This is the first time, however, in many years, that we have been proposed a strategic objective, and I believe this is extraordinarily important: to transform the Union into an economic area based on innovation and knowledge to increase economic growth and achieve full, quality employment and social cohesion. Last year, the Commission produced a study which concluded that, unless we significantly address qualifications and vocational training, by 2010, 80% of those currently employed will have outdated professional qualifications, which will exacerbate existing inequalities and produce new ones. Therefore, we need continuous training and massive investments in knowledge and expertise. Also with regard to research, another strategic sector, it is necessary to promote it in the Member States, in Europe; we need to make a qualitative leap, moving from framework programs to a European Research Area, to a common research policy. And innovation: not only structural and technological, but also in procedures and methods. As Mrs. Van Lancker said, the Social Affairs Council must have the same importance as the Ecofin Council. Therefore, social dialogue must be strengthened as a fundamental instrument of consensus for making the necessary changes. Lisbon must be remembered not only for the excellent preparatory document, but as a Summit that, with the new millennium, will mark a significant turning point for growth, employment, and social cohesion in Europe. Mr. President of the Council, I would like to congratulate you for having brought Europe together on the idea that economic modernization and social cohesion are compatible concepts. The preparations for the Lisbon Summit highlight that not enough work is being done in Europe, and that, if we want to be the most dynamic region in the world, we must not only work harder, but also have more information and the ability to use it.	es
At the same time, they call for the existence of an independent European body to coordinate and monitor the regularity of OLAF investigations, without prejudice to the administration of justice in each Member State and under the supervision of the Court of the European Communities. Finally, in line with what was agreed in Tampere, the report reaffirms the position of the European Public Prosecutor's Office, which was opportunely brought to the fore by decision of Commissioner António Vitorino, and requests the IGC to include on its agenda the creation of this new position, which is now considered indispensable by all. By reaffirming the need to effectively regulate the legal life of the institutions, enclosing the Union's financial system with European substantive and procedural law appropriate to the credibility of the Community's economic life, this report deserves our approval. However, it raises some very simple questions. Will there currently be sufficient legal grounds to legally justify the creation of a new, specifically Community-based criminal law that, although it may be considered subsidiary, will always compete in practice and in certain sectors with the traditional and fragmented criminal law of the Member States? Wouldn't it be politically more correct, in case of doubt, to include the reform of the judicial system on the agenda of the IGC, incorporating these proposals into the more general reform of the Union's judicial system, similar to what is being called for the European Public Prosecutor's Office? Wouldn't these measures be of the utmost interest for a revision of the Treaties that contributes to the solidity of the Union's Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice? Mr. President, the EU is being subjected to rigorous scrutiny. Confidence in the Union is seriously damaged. Action is needed to remedy this situation. That is why we welcome the increase in resources for OLAF, which will allow for more effective investigation of all concerns. We also believe it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU should be held accountable. It is regrettable that the Convention on the protection of the Union's financial interests applies in so few Member States. For this reason, we believe it is logical to task the Union with submitting proposals that involve developing the existing judicial framework. However, I'm not convinced that this kind of improvement requires common European standards or centralized crime control. Currently, I'm skeptical about the idea of a European Public Prosecutor; it seems impractical within the framework of the current treaties. We believe more in EUROJUST, where national prosecutors collaborate. The big problem isn't the adoption of legal measures to combat crimes, but rather the fact that they are committed so frequently and are discovered so infrequently. The challenge for the Commission and for us, however, is to find the right balance. Fraud and irregularities must not chain us to a hierarchical bureaucracy that, through excessive controls, impedes the development of a modern administration.	es
This is the correction that must be imposed on the Commission's actions. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the fundamental democratic principle of respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, against any new or old fascism, Nazism, or communism, and bearing in mind that all previous speakers have spoken of the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we see that today it is precisely this Parliament that denies that sovereignty. A reading of the Austrian Liberal Party's program reveals no elements that justify accusations of an attack on the principles of liberty, democracy, and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty. However, I would like to draw the attention of the honorable Members to the fact that the President-in-Office of the Council, so critical of Austria, recently handed the inhabitants of Macau over to the sovereignty of the democratic People's Republic of China. But today, perhaps, to strengthen the Union's democracy, it is opportune to isolate Austria, criminalize a party democratically elected by the Austrian citizens, and allow the Turkey of the Grey Wolves into Europe. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating an extremely serious issue. Nothing more and nothing less than the presence in a Member State's government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral foundations that inspire the Union and are enshrined in its founding Treaties. A simple reading of Article 1 of Chapter 4 of the Austrian Liberal Party's political program shocks any democratic conscience. The assumption of ethnicity as a defining factor of a nation and the assertion of the superiority of one ethnic group over others, as written here, resurrects old specters of a century we have just left behind and which some historians have defined as the century of horrors, horrors that the unacceptable philosophy of Mr. Haider's political program once again stirs before our astonished eyes. Of course, the Austrian people are sovereign, and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State. But that is not the problem. The problem is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State that includes a party with such characteristics. Our answer to this crucial question is no. Beyond strategic or tactical considerations, beyond possible excuses drawn from the behavior of others, beyond and above party interests or electoral circumstances, the Spanish delegation of the People's Party Group in this Parliament, in complete harmony with the Spanish People's Party and the Government of Spain, emphatically expresses its full agreement with the declaration of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of January 31, with its content, its tone, and its scope. (Applause) Konrad Adenauer once said—and he knew what he was talking about—that the surest way to appease a tiger is to let it devour you. History is the compendium of those things that could have been avoided.	es
We will not fail to focus all our attention on this problem because the entire credibility of the authorities and structures representing Albanians on the ground also depends on their ability to prove that they are capable of implementing measures guaranteeing the multi-ethnic character of the territory. I would like to thank the President-in-Office. I am aware—as I think we all are—that Portugal, its former President, Mr. Soares, and his government maintained a circumspect and moderate attitude during the bombings in the Balkans. Today's political declaration on this issue is very positive, I emphasize and welcome it. Despite everything, there is concern, because while the intentions of the European Union are good and sincere, the results are very meager. Unfortunately, in recent times, we have witnessed the disappearance of all the minorities—Serbs, Roma, Turks, Croats—from Kosovo, and we wonder what will happen next. We note the failure of the UN mission and Mr. Kouchner in Kosovo. Because it is a failure that after an entire war waged to prevent ethnic cleansing, a cleansing by the other side should occur. That is why I repeat my question: does the Council intend to take more concrete initiatives to address these issues with Mr. Kouchner, who is largely responsible for the situation prevailing in Kosovo today? Mr. Alavanos, I cannot agree with what you have just said, with your last sentence concerning Mr. Kouchner's responsibilities, and I would like to make a very important distinction: the structure installed in Kosovo is a structure placed under the supervision of the United Nations. The European Union has given it all possible support, and the countries of the European Union, as such, have contributed in various ways. But it cannot be denied that Mr. Kouchner's efforts to normalize the internal situation in Kosovo are extremely positive. Regardless of the fact that you may believe, and we also believe, that some of the results of these efforts, for reasons beyond Mr Kouchner's control, may not have been as effective as we would all have hoped. A distinction must be made, on the one hand, between the question of the European Union's responsibility and, in particular in this case, the Council's possible action in this context, and, on the other hand, the responsibility of the international community as such, which has overall oversight of the situation in Kosovo. The European Union's responsibility is therefore part of a specific context. It is to the international community as such, in particular the United Nations, that we must turn with regard to responsibilities for implementing Resolution 12/99 and in particular with regard to the logic underlying this resolution and its compatibility with reality. These are questions that we must all ask ourselves, but it is within the framework of the United Nations that we must ask ourselves these questions.	fr
The honourable Member referred to the issue of Ethiopia, which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes. However, as the Honourable Member knows, there are various Community-wide actions to combat AIDS, and in this regard, the Honourable Member is right: the United States is probably doing no better. Furthermore, in terms of development aid policy, I believe that Europe strictly has nothing to worry about, for the simple reason that our performance in this regard is in no way comparable with that of the United States. The honourable Member's question strayed into the broader political problem of armaments, which I do not believe falls within the scope of this question, but which the Council will naturally address in the future if it deems it appropriate and decides to raise it within a specific framework. Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by exporting food to developing countries at prices below EU production costs? Does the current President plan to intervene in this matter? Since its author is not present, Question 13 falls. I thank the President-in-Office of the Council, in whose person I personally welcome you to the Presidency of the Portuguese Government. Allow me to point out how eloquent he is and how well-versed in European issues he is. However, in my case, he has not given the answer that I would consider satisfactory. If the Council recognizes the great importance of culture as an economic asset, in my opinion, it should also demonstrate this in practice. And I fear that the justification that the cultural sector is conditioned by the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore the responsibility of national governments is an apparent justification. Because the question I had raised, and which has remained unanswered, was why, when the European Parliament requests an increase in funds allocated to finance European Union cultural programs, the Council, as well as the Commission, generally cut them, sometimes even cancel them. This, in practice, demonstrates its indifference to culture, despite the Council's promises about the great importance it is supposed to attach to it. I would therefore like to ask the Council whether it is prepared to support culture in the future with the same complacency with which it finances bananas, hops, cows, or Indian hemp. We do not, Your Honor, have an economic conception of our management of the Portuguese Presidency, and therefore, as you will understand, the cultural dimension is at the heart of our concerns. But these cultural dimensions almost always have an economic dimension, in turn, that is, the set of resources that can be mobilized precisely to support cultural activities. And this is a dimension that is difficult to overcome within the European Union and, in particular, within the Council. For our part, we will try to strengthen and consolidate the European position with regard to cultural goods and services and activities in this area, because we believe that this is one of the essential elements of the Union's image and its own specific identity.	es
You may be aware that this hospital is located in the northern part of the city and that, given the current tense situation, Kosovo Albanians cannot access the hospital under any circumstances. What is the Commission doing to ensure that Kosovo Albanians have access to the hospital? Regarding the first question, I will personally travel to Kosovo early next month for another visit and will certainly examine the allegations the Honourable Member has made about the ECHO food package. I had not heard anything about that suggestion before, but it is an important point, and I will certainly investigate it when I am there. Secondly, I fully understand what the Honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica. I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago and saw for myself what the situation was like. I held discussions with municipal leaders from both communities, including the leader of the Albanian side, who had previously worked as a doctor and earned universal acclaim for his medical care during and after the hostilities. I am therefore aware of the serious problem that exists in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will spare no effort to ensure that everyone in Kosovo has access to adequate healthcare, regardless of their ethnic group. The specific difficulties that exist in Mitrovica—for example, it is not just a matter of Albanian patients having difficulty accessing the hospital, but Albanian staff have had difficulty working there—represent a particularly serious problem. We will try to find solutions, but it is not easy. Question No. 37 by (H-0029/00): Subject: The blockade maintained by Turkey against Armenia. Bearing in mind that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic, and political relations with Armenia under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999, what measures does the Commission intend to take to persuade the Turkish Government of the need to lift the economic blockade it maintains against Armenia? The Commission supports all efforts aimed at finding a solution to the conflicts between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that normalization of relations between the two countries has not yet been achieved. In the current political circumstances, however, it is unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as that between Armenia and Azerbaijan, could be opened without first reaching a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Mr. President, the Commission is also negotiating with an eye to the future, in view of Turkey's accession to the European Union. Is the Commission prepared to impose the prior lifting of the blockade as a condition for starting talks, given that, after all, we are all neighbors and also want to cultivate positive neighborly relations within the European Union? My question, therefore, is this: Does the Commission intend to impose this as one of the conditions for improving the outcome of future discussions? The fundamental issue is support for the efforts of the OSCE Minsk Group to find a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and we are ready to help in any way we can.	es
I want to address another fundamental democratic issue frankly. As a Member of the Assembly that has just begun work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I want to make it perfectly clear that, for my group and myself, a solemn proclamation of the Charter is not enough. What would citizens say if they were solemnly granted rights but could not assert them individually? No, I believe that would only further deepen the credibility crisis from which the Union is suffering. For all of us, the low turnout in the European elections should be a sufficient warning signal. What we need are rights that are perceptible to all; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be legally binding on everyone living in the Union, on all citizens. In the interests of the latter, we should work together towards this goal, and I expect the Intergovernmental Conference to review the Cologne decision on this matter at the end of the year. Naturally, it is also a question of the effectiveness of decisions and the functioning of the institutions in a Union enlarged to 27 members and more. This will not be achieved by a mini-reform such as that envisaged by the Council, and that is why all the institutions must be put to the test. We must undertake courageous changes while paying the greatest attention to the balance between large and small Member States. I insist on this particularly as the representative of a large Member State. I thank the Commission for the proposals it has put forward and I am convinced that there will be, within this Parliament too, in-depth discussions with citizens on all the issues they have raised. I would like to address one last issue. Parliament's opinion expressly calls for amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy. Indeed, economic globalization and especially the introduction of the euro and the accompanying Stability Pact make it necessary to examine decision-making processes. But that is not all. Above all, we need the courage to critically examine the policies pursued so far by the Union. We need a Europe marked by social justice. A Europe marked by social justice remains more relevant than ever because it is, above all, a matter of placing the fight against mass unemployment and poverty at the heart of the Union's policy. To do this, we also need the courage, in my view, to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty, which defines the Union, in the classic tradition of neoliberalism, as an open market economy with free competition, as well as Article 105 of the EC Treaty, because the European Central Bank must finally respect the mission assigned to it by the Treaty, which is to promote, through its monetary policy, sustainable growth and employment. Mr President, the Europe of Nations Group believes that the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference, as defined by the Helsinki Council, that is to say, focused strictly on issues of decision-making in an enlarged Europe, must be respected.	fr
I would like to commend your thesis of greater synergy between the institutions, not only between the Commission and Parliament, but also between them and the Council, to underline the scale of the political challenge. We need a broader dialogue, not only between us, but also with civil society. We need to explain more about what Europe is, we need to be able to address fears and concerns, because in many cases, the greatest fear is fear itself. Perhaps by promoting dialogue and information we will be able to overcome part of this problem. My group is particularly attracted by the creative possibilities that you have raised in relation to the White Paper on new forms of government that will be presented in the spring. Faced with this Europe as an interconnection of different levels that you have described, it is very important that Europe concentrates on its core activities, that is, it is important to have the courage to suggest that there are areas in which Europe could perhaps step aside. Such an attitude could convince citizens that Europe, in its forms of government, is not directed exclusively by Brussels, which concentrates and swallows up more and more powers, decisions and authorities. This is the political essence of the challenge and I think you have illustrated it well to this House today. For my group, enlargement is the first priority against which all other possibilities for reform must be measured, whether they concern forms of government, the Intergovernmental Conference or the reform of the institutions. We see enlargement as a partnership process, not as a process that concerns only us and them; enlargement, for us, is an overall gain for both the Member States and the candidate countries. May I suggest that the Commission, which has an extraordinary amount of detailed information on enlargement, should present a document which explains the value of enlargement, not only in financial and budgetary terms, but in a broader sense: a document similar to the Cecchini report before the Single Act, which explains to citizens, so as to involve them in the debate, that this is the great historical challenge facing modern Europe. We must be able to prepare the ground very carefully. On south-eastern Europe, I agree with you that the value of political institutions is measured by the results they achieve. During the term of this Commission and of this Parliament, we must be able to achieve peace in south-eastern Europe, however difficult and complex that may be. We welcome the stabilisation and association agreements, but we would also like something more. We will make this material public and present it in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week. The strategic document emphasizes the global role of the European Union: our central objective must be to give the Union, on the global stage, a weight that is proportional to its weight in terms of aid, trade and financial flows. At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally before the end of these ten years, and in particular our role within international monetary bodies, within United Nations agencies and so on. This is a debate that we must launch. To conclude, this morning, the day after Valentine's Day, the newspapers write that our honeymoon is over.	it
"I am referring to the very serious accusations levelled against people and parties like mine, with a long democratic tradition and a scrupulous respect and defence of human rights demonstrated for many years. Madam President, I am concerned that this all-out defence of human rights by Mr Knörr does not prevent his party - in government in that region - from counting on the parliamentary support of a political group that not only does not condemn, but actually encourages violence against citizens and property. I note that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso has asked to speak on the same subject. This is not the right time to open a debate. I will give the floor for all procedural motions at the end of the votes. Report (A5-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of a pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta (COM(1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)) On amendments 22 and 24 In other words, the rapporteur proposes an oral amendment to insert a recital which would read: ""whereas Malta and Cyprus will participate..."" . (Parliament agreed to the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) Report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C50174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS)) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) Report (A5-0020/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council framework decision on increasing protection by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro (5116/1999 - C50332/1999 - 1999/0821(CNS)) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) Report (A5-0019/2000) by Mrs Di Pietro, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs citizens, justice and home affairs, on the draft Council act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union (9636/1999 - C50091/1999 and SN 5060/1999 - C5-0331/1999 - 1999/0809(CNS)) Before the vote, Madam President, I would first like to denounce the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. When dealing with these third pillar issues and conventions that are so important for the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice, it is not a good thing for the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to be absent. Furthermore, Madam President, I have some comments to make on the problem of translations. I will give you just one example, because we do not have much time, but it is a case where translations are really important, since very specific legal concepts are involved. In Amendment No 83, in Italian, which is the original language, states that ""the minor must be assisted by a person he trusts or by an external expert or lawyer""."	it
"So this is at least a step forward. The second criticism we have is that the system was too restrictive vis-à-vis the Commission. We adopt legislation in the European Union. We expect the Commission to implement it. And from that moment on, a system designed to hamper the Commission and make its work more difficult intervenes—in particular, this was the case with the so-called ""counter-sirloin"" system, through which the Council could block the Commission by means of a simple majority, even if the Council was unable to find an alternative to the implementing measure concerned. In this area, too, there is at least some progress. The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless a qualified majority has been reached to block the measure—in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States within the Council. This is a more reasonable system. This is also a step forward. However, with regard to the other two criticisms, we are less satisfied. The first criticism concerns the system by which the Commission is monitored, scrutinized, controlled, if you will, by a single committee appointed by the Member States or the Council and not by Parliament. The legislative authorities, namely the Council and Parliament, should be equal. We confer executive powers on the Commission, but only a body appointed by the Council or the Member States can put the kibosh on it, say no to the Commission, and put a stop to an implementing measure. Parliament does not have an equivalent power. It is true that we are now being granted the outline of such a power under this new system. We are supposed to receive all draft implementing measures sent to a committee at the same time as they are sent to that committee. We will have the opportunity to examine them, debate them, and ask questions. However, we will only have the right to challenge the Commission if we believe it is exceeding the powers we have conferred on it in the legislation. In other words, we can challenge the measure if it exceeds its powers, but not its content. And in a democracy, Parliament should be able to challenge the content. I'm not saying we do this every week. We don't seek to delve into implementing decisions, but the fact that we should have the opportunity to do so on the rare occasions when it is necessary constitutes a democratic safeguard. This is what is missing from this system, or at least what is present only in embryonic form. Finally, our fourth criticism is this: if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system, it is referred not to both branches of the legislative authority, but only to the Council, which has the right to take, if necessary, an alternative measure. This is not correct. Both branches—Council and Parliament—adopt the legislation that confers implementing powers on the Commission. If such implementing measures are referred, they should be to both branches, not just to one. Generally speaking, we have a system that has improved somewhat. The additional aspects arising from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but this could not change the Council's basic decision."	fr
"The Commission must therefore assume its responsibilities in establishing the strategic framework for promoting employability and quality of work, in assessing results and in effectively disseminating best practices. Only in this way can the desired multiplier effect be achieved. Mr President, I would like to speak on the Commission's proposals for the budget line for information on the CAP. On 26 October 1999, the Commission adopted a proposal to secure the legal basis for the budget line for raising public awareness of the common agricultural policy. Under this proposal, the current budget line B2-5122 will be abolished in favour of a new budget line B1-382. Actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the European Union, and which also create stronger links with the candidate countries and the rest of the world, are important. I am therefore tabling amendments to Parliament to support this type of programme. Since it is necessary to encourage young farmers to remain in agriculture, it is essential that they are well informed about developments in the common agricultural policy: information and training of young farmers at European level is essential. I ask you to accept that part of the available budget should be earmarked for developing knowledge among young European farmers. In the area of information and training, in the past, the budget line was earmarked for information, communication and training. The Commission is now proposing to exclude training. I believe that training should be included where it involves relevant information on the CAP at European level. European training is an element that serves to ensure that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to be able to take sound decisions about their future activities. I have therefore tabled three amendments which I ask the Parliament to approve. Mr President, I am taking the floor to express, on the basis of my experience in a municipal administration, the opportunity, but I would almost dare say the necessity, that the projects of the URBAN programme be oriented in a threefold direction: firstly, to promote the recovery of infrastructures and historic, old and perhaps degraded neighbourhoods. Secondly, to facilitate and stimulate economic activities and social life within these historic centres, within these corners of the ""old city"". What use are those streets, today perhaps tastefully lit, with redone sidewalks, even with tiled paving, splendid in their clarity, if we are then not capable of filling them with activities and therefore employment? And I would like to point out that here it is not a question of financing or assisting different social categories, but rather of knowing how to discern the employment vocation in the projects to be selected, or, but it is the same thing, of selecting projects that are able to incentivise the creation of jobs and initiatives in this area, to give them more impetus. Thirdly, but perhaps I should have said firstly, projects must be aimed primarily at the total recovery of people and families, because man does not exist to serve the law, but it is the law that exists to serve man."	it
"The CFSP will never be anything more than a screen for national interests that have already taken over the system: How can we not see that it is a marriage between London and Berlin, supported when necessary by their respective accomplices and who do not conceive of their diplomacy in terms of autonomy from Washington, carving out for themselves the role of extras. On the other hand, Mr Solana, you are a living example of this so-called structural connivance: you have gone from NATO to the CFSP without discontinuity, as if it were the same thing, and in reality it is. It is always about serving the empire. I cannot deny a certain amusement in hearing you invoke this delightful and at the same time persuasive argument in the ridiculous competition that opposes you to Commissioner Patten. In any case, you declared to a German journalist: ""The Americans call me"". Mr Solana, you could have added: ""It is to me that the orders are passed"", because that is our observation. In the Balkans and elsewhere, the Americans ask us to destroy one day and then to rebuild the next. Mr Martinez was absolutely right to interrupt you, Mr Cohn-Bendit, it is still servility. You think I am being excessive! Not a day goes by without the reality of the facts providing us with additional proof of our subservience. ECHELON is one of many examples and it offers an image of Europe that is very different from the one we like to paint here. The experts talk about a cultural problem, I personally find them very amusing. On behalf of the coordination of the European right, I must tell you, Mr High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, that we do not trust you. You say you are against war, but as Secretary General of NATO you have started one. It was an offensive war, in servile obedience to American policy in an area that does not fall within the North Atlantic Treaty, against a State that had never been a party to it, that did not pose any threat to international borders, a war provoked in violation of international law which establishes the principle of non-interference and the rules governing the declaration of war. Today even Mr Cohn-Bendit finds himself having to assess the results of the disastrous policy that he himself supported. We too have some questions to ask you that betray our concern, to put it mildly. Firstly, you claim that the common foreign and security policy aims to safeguard the security of the Member States of the Union. How can we believe that? Or do you perhaps recognise that these States have the right to intervene anywhere in the world? Secondly, in the latter hypothesis, to which rules of international law and political morality are you referring? I can already imagine your answer: humanitarian law. In Kosovo we systematically destroyed all Serbian civilian infrastructure in the name of humanitarian law. When the US caused the death of 2,000 people in Panama, it was certainly not to impose its policies, it was to fight drug trafficking."	it
"Therefore, on behalf of my group, I am in favour of the Theato report; however, I believe that it is essentially a matter that should be included on the agenda of the IGC. Mr President, Mrs Theato's report on the protection of the financial interests of the European Union proposes, in particular and initially, to centralise criminal proceedings through a European Public Prosecutor's Office. This proposal is decidedly contrary to the spirit of the current system in which criminal law and criminal procedure, which are the cornerstone of national legal systems, must depend on the sovereignty of each people and are the exclusive competence of each State. The idea of a European Public Prosecutor's Office, on the other hand, aims, as regards this matter, to relegate the States to a subordinate role. Furthermore, this proposal would trigger a series of completely unforeseeable reforms. Indeed, according to Mrs Theato's report, the European Public Prosecutor's Office would be necessary, in particular, to frame the investigations of the Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF. But, at the same time, we discover that according to the Van Hulten report, the European Public Prosecutor's Office should in turn be supervised by a European Union court. This is how a small European reform can hide a medium-sized reform that can in turn hide a larger one. Without forgetting that a large reform can in turn hide a giant one because very soon we will be proposed a European criminal law and then, why not, subsequently, also a European Minister of Justice, controlled by the European Parliament, extending its powers. Therefore, I believe that we need to think carefully about the balance of powers that we risk upsetting by presenting this type of apparently specific reform. In conclusion, it seems to us that proposals such as that of a European Public Prosecutor's Office demonstrate the inability to imagine a Europe that is not only top-down, centralized and organized around a super-state. The ""Union for a Europe of Nations"" group instead wants a polycentric Europe that brings together nations as a network. A network that could be revealed, for example, with better coordination between national prosecutors, with the creation, possibly, of national bodies specialized in infringements against Community finances. Mr President, the legal framework already exists, it is based on a good principle and it only needs to be improved. Mr President, Mrs Theato is proposing an institutional revolution for two reasons. Public opinion, which would be indifferent to twenty million unemployed and thousands of mad cows, would instead be concerned about fraud that would endanger financial interests and these two reasons would justify a two-fold device: a European penal code that includes anti-Community crimes and a European Attorney General. Mrs Theato seems to have forgotten a European prison, however, since the FBI, the European police, already exists with OLAF. The whole thing would be enshrined in two regulations, one for the Prosecutor and one for the penal code, regulations based on Article 280 of the Treaty, that is, starting from secondary law because the characteristic of secondary law is to allow any deviation. In reality there would be two deviations."	it
"We believe that, precisely because Turkey has embarked on a new path in its relationship with the European Union, and also because it now faces the need to respond to the European Union's positions on common foreign and security policy, we are going to test—there's no point in hiding this—its willingness to address the European Union's priorities in its foreign relations. And naturally, the relationship with Armenia, as evidenced by the agreement established last year, is an element of that foreign relationship. And we believe that, if Turkey wants to move forward in sharing the fundamental values of the European Union and the general framework for the European Union's relationship—and regardless of any bilateral differences it may have with another country—it must generally behave in accordance with the basic guidelines that the European Union reflects in its foreign relations. Furthermore, we are confident that this issue will be among the priorities of the bilateral relationship between the European Union and Turkey in the near future. Because these are similar issues, questions 5 and 6 will be answered together. Question No. 5 by (H-0031/00): Subject: Worsening situation in Kosovo The genocide of the Serbs and other ethnic minorities, except the Albanians, continues and is worsening in Kosovo. Even Mr. Kouchner himself recently declared that ""the political and security situation in the area is absolutely unsatisfactory."" It is also alleged that UN Resolution 1244 has not been respected, since, on the one hand, the UN provisions on granting guarantees to all inhabitants of Kosovo are being violated, and, on the other, extremist and separatist forces are gaining strength, to the point of appointing the former leader of the KLA, Hachim Thaçi, as ""provisional prime minister"" of Kosovo and proclaiming the latter ""Kosovo Protection Corps."" What actions does the Council intend to take, in view of the facts, to ensure the implementation of UN resolutions, especially Resolution 1244, and to prevent the secession of the province of Kosovo from Serbia? Question No. 6 by (H-0122/00): Subject: Ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo. Since the end of the NATO and EU bombing of Yugoslavia under the pretext of preventing the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo Albanians by Serbia, and since the entry of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200,000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 murdered, reproducing an ethnic cleansing of Serbs comparatively greater than the one that occurred in the opposite direction. In recent days, we have witnessed the murder of Serbs by Kosovo Albanian mafias, always with impunity. What decision does the Council intend to take to finally end this ethnic cleansing and guarantee respect for human rights for the entire population of Kosovo, regardless of race or belief? I would like to thank the Minister for his response, but also to point out that, statistically, there is more violence in Kosovo now than there was before the NATO bombing."	es
"In this context, water is not a commercial commodity: it is an essential element for life, and people must have free access to a sufficient supply for their normal daily lives. We consider it positive that efforts are being made to reverse alarming trends in water degradation, which governments too often overlook. We all know that water is an essential good for humanity and that it is urgent to protect its quality. But it is equally essential to bear in mind that the components of water policy are inseparable, and action on this aspect determines all the others. However, in the debate and in the proposals, preference has been given to the topic of ""physical, chemical, and ecological quality of water,"" and the adverse effects on the other dimensions have been taken into account only marginally. Thus, it is necessary to take into account the diversity of the realities of the Member States, the specific climates, the hydrological regimes and their variations throughout the year, and the social, economic, and ecological effects of the implementation of standards, or even their absence. Concerns about these issues are what have led us to disagree with some proposals from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, especially those relating to an overly restrictive timeline and the lack of attention to social and agricultural aspects, which are very important for a country like Portugal, where there are problems with water scarcity and, in addition, poor socioeconomic development. However, we also believe that in many cases the proposals from the Commission and the Council are too retrograde, and we therefore hope for a balanced vote within the constraints of the proposals presented. The Council's common position on this proposed framework directive has not disappointed. It is minimalist on several points, especially regarding the entry into force dates of a far too large number of provisions, as well as the number and conditions for applying the derogations. However, the main problem lies in the definition of the objective that the European Union wishes to achieve with this text. The objective is, of course, above all, to create a clear general framework that will finally simplify the applicable law in this area. However, in addition to this objective, the Union must have the ambition to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater. Public health and the supply of drinking water, biological quality and diversity, and the preservation of landscapes and species are at stake. From this perspective, the common position is weak. I wish our Parliament would defend a more ambitious position than that of the Council, but I also wish this position were credible. The requirement for ""zero discharges"" and ""zero pollution,"" including substances naturally present in water, is unrealistic. I am not one of those Members who believe it is essential to adopt ""extreme"" amendments at second reading, the sole purpose of which is to create room for maneuver with the prospect of negotiations with the Council of Ministers."	es
"The ""Grappa War"" is thus over. Peace reigns, and we look forward to cooperation with South Africa in accordance with the shared dreams and values that should have guided our relationship for a long time. I consider this a pleasant conclusion to the debate, which was overall quite positive, and I would like to thank the rapporteur and Parliament once again for the cooperation they have shown, particularly in this context, in their relations with developing world countries. Thank you, Commissioner. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00 noon. Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia The next item is the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121(COS)). Mr President, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, today we are dealing with a country that has truly gone through difficult times, a country that has, however, developed very positively through its own strength, its own will and certainly also with the support of the international community. Therefore, when the European Union, Council, and Commission propose—and Parliament will endorse this proposal tomorrow, I assume—to conclude a Stabilization and Association Agreement, the first in Southeast Europe, in the Balkans—I dare say I use that term—then this is primarily a thank you or recognition for the fact that FYROM/Macedonia has carved out a good position for itself, economically, but of course, and above all politically, in light of the war in its neighborhood and also in relation to its own minority. Having a minority of 33 or even 35 percent in one's own country is no small feat, especially given the environment in which this country finds itself. The country and its politicians—to varying degrees here and there—have always done very good work, and this should be recognized. The Commission proposes that we conclude an agreement together with the Council. I would like to make a few comments, namely concerning those areas where views are perhaps somewhat more differentiated, although in this context I would also like to particularly emphasize and acknowledge Commissioner Patten's work and interest in FYROM/Macedonia and the entire region. First: the regional approach. I believe that the regional approach, if properly understood, is important and necessary. There must be a willingness to cooperate. If it is not understood as a constraint, but rather as a willingness, as an opportunity that every country should utilize, then this approach is correct. However, if we look at FYROM/Macedonia, we see that there are some countries in the neighborhood with which cooperation is very difficult, for example, economically, such as Kosovo and Albania, or politically, such as Yugoslavia. On the other hand, cooperation with Bulgaria, and especially with Greece, has developed positively; this too should be recognized."	de
In Spain—I want to remind you all—it's not that we are in an election period, it's that there are twenty-five days left until the elections. It is a consolation for the Commissioner that these elections will be held in twenty-five days, so he probably won't be asked these kinds of questions again. I do consider it important to say that Andalusia will receive 50% more within the Community framework and that Spain also holds a record in terms of the implementation of the Structural Funds, which means that the distribution is strictly based on the implementing regulations and is decentralized through regional development plans and the various Community support frameworks. Finally, I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question: do you consider a change to the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds necessary, or do you consider the current distribution criteria acceptable? I find this debate fascinating. I fully understand that there is a dimension that is not exclusively Community-based. However, we must accept the fact that elections are constantly taking place in all countries of the Union. What pleases me is that, fundamentally, the Structural Funds are being debated in Greece and Spain. Earlier, we were talking here about citizen debates, public debates. The more we talk about Europe and what Europe does for everyday life, as long as we talk objectively, even when there are certain differences, the better. I am not going to express my opinion, Your Honor, on a possible change to the Structural Funds regulation. It was not long ago that it was approved—last year—in Berlin. I am putting it into practice for the next seven years. We will talk about it again during the debate on the cohesion report, which for me is an important event, here, with you, and before you, to take stock and at the same time to outline perspectives. At the beginning of next year, the time will come to talk about possible adjustments, possible modifications. For now, please allow me to apply the regulation that has not yet been applied, as it dates from the Berlin Council. This is what I can say today. Thank you very much, Mr. Barnier, for your answers. Questions 48 to 50 will be answered in writing. Question 51 by (H-0049/00): Subject: New OHIM premises. The Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market is currently operating in its same temporary premises, despite the new building having been inaugurated in June 1999. Given this unusual situation, the Commission asks: What are the reasons why OHIM has not yet moved to its new premises? The Honourable Member posed a question on this subject in November 1999, and I would like to refer to the answer given on that occasion. Furthermore, in connection with this new question, I have consulted the President of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market—that is, the Alicante office—and on its behalf I can inform the Honourable Member of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market as follows:	es
We will launch a broad and open consultation process to gather the views of all the different stakeholders. I consider the process to be almost as important as the content; we will devote all our resources to active participation and we invite all interested parties to participate. In parallel, we have also launched a process to improve coherence and to clarify, bring to the surface and make manifest the real or imagined problems we encounter in this area. It will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of constant quality control and I invite Parliament to take part in it in order to improve the coherence of our actions. Mr President, I would first like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Amado, for what he said, as well as Commissioner Nielson. I am pleased that Mr Amado spoke about the European Development Fund. The resolution of the problem does not depend on this institution, on the European Parliament, or on the Commission; rather, it is up to the Council to take the initiative to give the EDF its own budget, and therefore it is to the Council that the sermon should be addressed. Mr President, I would also like to thank Commissioner Nielson, who spoke at length about the new Lomé Convention. However, that Convention is not exactly the subject we are discussing this morning. In fact, we intended to talk about coherence: that is the real issue today. Already at the beginning of the 1990s, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council recognised that the degree of coherence of the Union's policies was not satisfactory, particularly in the area of development cooperation and in other aspects of European policy. Attention to this problem has been called for on several occasions: in 1992, 1995 and 1997. The resolution we are examining summarises more or less all the attempts made in this regard in the past. I myself already put questions on this issue years ago. In 1997, the obligation of coherence was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam and then, in 1998, it was decided that the European Commission would draw up an annual report on the progress made. But what has happened since then? We have heard so many fine words, even this morning, but we have not yet seen any reports. It almost seems absurd to say so, but it is true: it is widely acknowledged that the Union's policy is contradictory, good intentions are constantly being made, but in practice nothing happens. It is therefore a good thing that this item is on our agenda today. I will use a few examples to explain the contradictions in the Union's policy. In some developing countries, sugar cane is grown to produce sugar. In the Union, sugar is produced from beetroot. To prevent cheap sugar from developing countries from competing with the more expensive sugar from the Union, a heavy tax has been imposed on sugar cane imports. As a result, imports of this product into the Union have fallen significantly. At the same time, we provide large amounts of development aid to those same countries that produce sugar cane. A minister from a Caribbean island where sugar cane is grown once said to me: If you allowed us to sell our sugar in the Union, we could easily do without your development aid.	it
How should one describe the rapes, looting, arson, and deportations declared as purges, which are reminiscent of the darkest Middle Ages in Europe? How should one describe the isolation of Russian and international journalists and the banishment of humanitarian organizations and every international commission of inquiry from the sites of the massacres? If this is realpolitik, if we truly have no means at our disposal, then I ask you, Mr. High Representative, Mr. Commissioner, let us at least use the means we do have: the aid programs for Russia. The Chechen war proves—if it were still necessary—that the duty to intervene, or the right to intervene, ends at the border of the major powers. Let us therefore ensure that in future every euro spent in the Russian Federation is used for nothing other than alleviating the suffering of the war-affected population. Mr. High Representative, you have spoken of the progress made so far in implementing the Helsinki resolutions. Some of us are firmly in favor of creating a purely European security organization to protect peace in the world. Of course, we recognize the importance of the Security Council for maintaining peace and international security—also enshrined in the Helsinki decisions. However, it should be noted that you have said nothing about the fact that this role of the Security Council, also reaffirmed in Helsinki, has been questioned in the recent past. The crucial point is: Is there political will to ensure that this mechanism, which will cover the entire spectrum of the Petersberg decisions, truly has autonomous powers of action? What about infrastructure? Is there any plan to guarantee these autonomous powers of action for the entire system? Secondly, what will become of the European defense industry, which is ultimately involved in all activities related to the system? Will the current programs continue? Finally, if a change to the Treaty is necessary, how do you envisage this being implemented, according to the report being presented in Feira, and how will it be integrated into the general process of reforming the institutional framework of the Treaty? How do you see this relating to the possible introduction of qualified majority voting? Are such considerations being considered? Is this issue being discussed? To what extent has the cooperation between you and the Commissioner responsible produced concrete results and a framework strategy on how, in your view, this system can be made truly effective? Mr President, from my studies of European history, I seem to recall that the Agreement of Sintra in 1809 was a controversial peace agreement that prolonged rather than shortened the Napoleonic Wars and almost cost the Duke of Wellington his job. I hope that is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement. Now, however, I would like to congratulate the High Representative on the progress achieved so far. It should be noted, however, that most of his remarks concerned progress on institutional matters, and the true test of the European defense identity will be its ability to generate capacity and effectiveness, rather than the creation of institutions with nicely worded names. And in this regard, I am not sure how advanced our heavy-lift transport capacity is to get those 60,000 troops to their operational locations, or what progress we have made towards an autonomous reconnaissance service, particularly in light of the American statements that they will not provide intelligence to the Europeans until they have mastered security.	de
It should be remembered that the European Union's overall competitiveness is currently 81% that of the United States of America, and that this figure will only improve if the competitiveness of our competitive units, the regions, improves. This, moreover, comes at a time when technological developments, economic globalization, and our problems, enlargement and the single currency, make it more demanding for regions, but also for businesses and individuals, to make a greater competitive effort. The sixth report of the European Commission offers very valuable conclusions. I will summarize two of them, as the rapporteur has already mentioned, one positive and one negative. The first is that significant progress has been made in territorial and social cohesion throughout the Union and that Community funds have been an important, though not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities. The negative is that this great effort was more effective in bringing the GDP and productivity of European regions closer together than in their employment levels. It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation. This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period. Therefore, Mr. President, I ask my distinguished colleagues to adopt this report and I ask the Commission, as other colleagues have done, to bear in mind the conclusions of its Sixth Periodic Report when planning for the 2000-2006 period. Mr. President, Commissioner, distinguished colleagues, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his good work and for having duly taken into account the amendments proposed during the process of drafting the report in the parliamentary committee. This Sixth Periodic Report establishes the basis for assessing the achievement of the objectives of the Union's regional policy. The report shows that, despite all the efforts made, growth is uneven. The regions of Central Europe continue to experience very rapid development. The most prosperous centers also continue to grow above the European average, while many regions in Southern and Northern Europe are developing much more slowly. We now need a thorough analysis of the reasons why regional policy is not achieving the desired results in all regions. Is this due to bureaucracy or because the differences between regions, such as long distances, extreme cold or heat, low population density, and poor soil fertility, have not been sufficiently taken into account? How can the Union address the challenges brought about by the globalization process so that the most backward regions can integrate? It is also important to determine the effects that the enlargement of the Union will have on the Structural Funds and the development of peripheral regions. Member States must also remember their responsibilities. Some Member States have ignored the compensation principle and reduced national subsidies to regions as the Structural Funds from the Union have increased. This has neutralized the results of regional policy. In the future, we will also need to consider developing indicators to be able to adopt appropriate measures and target them in the right places.	es
Mr President, Commissioner, this report by my colleague, Mr Berend, is in line with the strategy adopted by the European Commission, giving absolute priority to the aspect of increasing competitiveness. However, the broader objectives of the Structural Funds, such as increasing employment, improving equal opportunities, and making employment and development more sustainable, are only mentioned marginally. I believe that this approach is unjustified and I would ask that the above points be given greater consideration in the sixth periodic report. This does not mean that I do not see the need to strengthen competitiveness, especially as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 region, namely Brandenburg, Germany, and I am well aware of the concerns and needs of small and medium-sized enterprises. In Objective 1 regions, it is absolutely necessary to introduce, in parallel, temporary measures to promote job creation, special programmes for young entrepreneurs and initiatives to support the setting up of their own businesses. These sectors are supported through appropriate measures under the EU Structural Funds. Support for the competitiveness of businesses alone cannot achieve the desired cohesion between economic and social development, as the Objective 1 regions lack the basis for an independent economic recovery. Economic development alone does not help to reduce unemployment, as is demonstrated by the fact that at least a 3% increase in gross national product is needed to create additional jobs. The desired results cannot be achieved by focusing exclusively on supply- and demand-oriented economic policy. And even if this were to be done, substantial investments in expansion would have to be made and fewer investments in rationalisation. This must absolutely be combined with a demand-oriented economic policy in order to have a chance of improving the situation in these regions. The situations in the various regions are quite different, which means that a series of accompanying measures would have to be implemented in order to be able to intervene in any way. For example, action is needed in the areas of vocational training, lifelong learning, the reintegration of workers who have been displaced from the production process, flexible working time organisation and types of working time, in order to be able to reconcile personal and social aspects much better and to be able to promote women's access to the labour market again. Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on his in-depth report. The main objective of the Structural Funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions of the European Union. By stimulating the most diverse investments, the Union is trying to achieve an increase in GDP per inhabitant and to increase employment. From the sixth periodic report on the regions, it can be deduced, with some caution, that the aforementioned incentives do not always have the desired effect. Efforts to increase GDP per inhabitant in the Objective 1 regions do not always generate such an increase. This cannot be said to be a satisfactory result, given that the reference period, at least in recent years, has been characterised by an economic recovery. As the rapporteur points out, even structural measures aimed at boosting employment have not had any noteworthy effects.	it
"We believe this would be desirable. I would like to make a few comments on the costs. Some say that the costs should be borne entirely by the producers, as this is fair and beneficial to consumers. This position seems highly questionable, as the producers would pass all the burden on to the consumers and create their own monopoly on state-controlled recycling. I would caution you against supporting this view. There are amendments which propose that the costs should be divided so that 50 percent are borne by the producers and 50 percent by the purchasers of new vehicles. With this pool, or however one imagines such a system, from 2006 onwards all vehicles in circulation can be taken back without any burden on the last holder, as my group expressly wishes. Our proposal on the distribution of costs has one important advantage, namely that we will not become liable to prosecution by the Court of Justice as soon as the directive has been adopted. Indeed, the retroactive effect that is causing so much concern and anxiety in the automotive industry is a serious problem that we must take into due consideration. For this reason, I propose that the costs be shared between the first holder and the manufacturer. A ban on certain materials: we need that! There are dangerous components in vehicles that must be banned in the long run. To do this, we need an instrument with which to exert the necessary pressure. The proposals put forward by the Commission are too rigid and we have developed some alternatives. A great many good amendments have been tabled. Parliament has gained more powers, let us make them count! We must have the courage to propose and develop a directive that shows the way forward in the future; a directive that was developed simply to do so would not be worthy of this House! I invite you to support my proposal. Mr President, I almost feel like breathing a sigh of relief: we are finally getting to the second reading of this directive that has given us a lot of work and, of course, a lot of work to its rapporteur, Mr Florenz. In my opinion, this directive is not at all satisfactory because it does not answer the real question: what will be done with vehicles that have already been abandoned and that can only be removed at the expense of the community and therefore of taxpayers? Therefore, the ""polluter pays"" principle does not apply. Vehicles that have already been abandoned are also abandoned by this Community legislation, since they are ignored both by the texts relating to landfills and by this text on VFU. The only merit of this directive is that it foresees the future. However, it has not been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently in use, but already old, whose recycling will cost much more. On the other hand, we can be quite confident about the future, since we know what efforts car manufacturers are willing to make to find, on the one hand, materials that are easier to recycle, and on the other, to activate recycling procedures. I will also insist on the fact that it is essential to maintain a certain flexibility between recycling, reuse and incineration for new, particularly light materials that allow for a reduction in vehicle consumption and therefore emissions."	it
"There have been several examples in Spain: Michelin, ABB-Alstom, and there are examples in Italy that my colleagues will give you. There is also another disguised method of dismissal, used, for example, in Spain by Ericsson under the name ""outsourcing"" (behind this beautiful word hides the word ""dismissal""). The outsourcing of services, that is to say the subcontracting of services, amounts to transforming a stable and permanent job into a precarious one, without union or social rights. It is indeed a disguised method of dismissal. Commissioner, if the European institutions believe in what they say and talk about full employment, they will have to take clear measures: review the directives to ensure workers' participation in these negotiations, review the directive on collective redundancies, reduce working hours, make European subsidies conditional on a clear commitment to maintaining employment, and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union. Mr President, this Parliament is once again discussing corporate restructuring in Europe, and I deplore this. Once again, workers are at risk of losing their jobs. Today, we are referring to the Goodyear workers in Cisterna di Latina. As has already been pointed out, this concerns some 600 people and as many families who could, within a month, find themselves deprived of their sole source of income. These workers - despite their willingness to help the company and their high level of professionalism, which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe - risk being excluded from the production chain. On the other hand, Goodyear, which has benefited from national and European subsidies for years, can calmly and freely close its doors. I believe this attitude is wrong: it is wrong towards the workers at the Cisterna plant, and it is wrong towards all the Italian and European citizens who have allowed Goodyear, even indirectly through the taxes they pay, to benefit from the state aid I mentioned earlier. The European Commission and the Council must assume all responsibilities related to this matter, both in terms of adopting a common position on the information and consultation of workers and in terms of Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies that commit to signing long-term agreements to protect jobs. Today, we are asking the Commission to defend, above all, the Goodyear workers at Cisterna and to exert all possible pressure on the company to reach an agreement as quickly as possible to ensure that the Cisterna plant continues to exist and operate. Finally, I would like to remind you, Mr President and Commissioner, that the time available is truly limited. Therefore, any measures – including those already mentioned by the Commissioner in his introductory report – that we would like to adopt must be adopted immediately and in a timely manner. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in terms of restructuring, there is no doubt that European businesses must adapt to better face new challenges, or risk disappearing."	fr
"It is therefore time to examine all the elements of the chain involved in the production of feed for high-yielding animals. It is worth noting, in passing, that the problem is much less serious for the food we eat for our dogs, cats, and other pets. Is it because of the fierce, globalized competition among manufacturers in this sector that it has become a recycling channel for all the waste from the agri-food industry? Such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate, even if the directive already limits the authorization of antibiotics and other growth promoters. The precautions we are about to take for animal feed must also be applied to the food we eat for farm animals, the very animals we will find on our plates. As this report forcefully emphasizes, labeling is an absolute necessity so that every farmer on their farm knows all the ingredients that go into the composition of the feed they feed their livestock. He also needs to know if GMOs have intruded into his bag of protein pellets. These components can potentially pose a risk to public health. In any case, the precautionary principle requires that we have clearly displayed traceability at all levels of marketing these products. But before labeling, clear rules must be put in place. We need to ask ourselves simple questions, such as the real purpose of using animal meal. If we look at all the problems they have caused us, from an ethical and health perspective, it is their very use that we need to question today. To this end, the chapter of the White Paper on Food Safety that deals with animal feed must serve as a working basis to go well beyond simple commercial issues. The Commission has repeatedly used this example: ""from farm to fork."" Our EPP colleague highlighted this earlier. This is a good formula, but it still needs to be given meaning. And to give it meaning, we need to address both animal-related issues and consumer health issues. This is why it is important to accept Amendment 2 to Recital 4, which avoids the risk of monopoly if the companies that were the first to place an additive on the market remained the only ones able to use it during the re-evaluation period. But above all, we must accept Amendments 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a, which will make it possible to clearly identify genetically modified additives in order to enable users to make a fully informed decision. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the presence of high-tech additives in the animal feed sector requires those involved – and everyone knows there are a great many of them – to provide detailed information on their use, in order to put an end to practices that are contrary to Community law. The directive in question, on additives in animal feed, is not enough. Other directives will follow, and I believe they are in good hands in the Committee on Agriculture. Animal feed and additives are structured, mixed, cut, sliced, and transported repeatedly until the meat, milk, bread, and other products are sold in stores."	fr
"Regarding the former, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and an action plan, designed to implement the following decision adopted by the Heads of Government in Tampere: ""to ensure fair treatment of third-country nationals legally residing in the territory of their Member States. A more vigorous integration policy should aim to grant them rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens."" This is precisely the opposite of what we have seen and observed in recent days in El Ejido: a world of irregularities, labor exploitation, and miserable living conditions, which have already been denounced. I hope for the swift implementation of the integration measures, and I also hope that the governments that used such fine words in Tampere—among them the Spanish government—will make a full commitment to their implementation. I have less hope for the development of an effective and fair European policy consistent with the Council's declarations on immigration. The only proposal received is the directive on family reunification, a key issue—we've seen many single men in the media in El Ejido these days—but we don't know if it has been adopted by governments yet. Outside of the Community sphere, some governments are making efforts to redesign their immigration policies. In my country, this is being done independently of the government; the governing party is the only one that dislikes the new Aliens Law. The objective of combating racism and xenophobia, enshrined in the Treaties, should be embraced by all institutions and all political leaders of the Union. European political parties signed the Charter of European Political Parties for a Society Without Racism on February 28, 1998. The People's Party also did so. This commits them to consistent action, but local leaders of this party are adding fuel to the fire by boycotting other institutions' attempts to extinguish it. The party to which the mayor of El Ejido belongs should act consistently, faithful to the commitments signed in this declaration. Only with great unity, as Mr. Hernández Mollar said, with responsibility and determination, can El Ejido, and with it all of Spain and Europe, overcome facts that today cause us deep shame. Mr. President, in the face of the scenes of veritable lynchings of Moroccan workers that unfolded in El Ejido, one can only feel disgust and indignation. We do not know to what extent the racist, far-right commandos are responsible, or the ordinary people who carelessly and thoughtlessly followed suit. We wish to express our unconditional solidarity with these Moroccan workers, who are not only exploited by unscrupulous employers but are also victims of such attacks. If the aggressors include members of the common people, we can only tell them that they are digging their own graves with their actions. By waging war against people just as poor as they are, they are only serving their own exploiters and preparing a future of oppression for themselves. However, those who engage in racist, xenophobic incitement bear even greater responsibility than the thugs armed with knives and iron bars, those who deliver demagogic, xenophobic speeches in Spain, Austria, France, or elsewhere, and even here in this very chamber. They are no better than those who take this reactionary, absurd demagogy at face value."	de
"We have all the instruments, all the tools we need, but we need to combine them much more effectively than before, and that is the challenge that the High Representative and I will face up to in the next four to five years. Now I hope that we will receive support in meeting these challenges in the form of both adequate resources and brilliant rhetoric. We all know that there are a number of reasons for building a common foreign and security policy. I would like to mention three of them: Bosnia, Albania, and Kosovo. These are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy, and we will be judged on how successful the common foreign and security policy we have developed will be, and above all on how we deal with the events in the Balkans. We must not lose sight of the fact that quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians, and quite a few senators and congressmen are asking: ""How can we take you seriously in your development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy if you can't even deal with the problems on your own doorstep?"" So, the big test for us will be the Balkans. I hope that all those heads of government, all those prominent politicians in our member states who promised the moon for the Balkans, who pledged the Marshall Plans, and who made all those other promises to the Balkans, will be there when the budgetary authority makes its decision on how much we need to spend on the Balkans. My great hope would be that we all live on one planet whose inhabitants also include the European Council, the General Affairs Council, and the Economic and Financial Affairs Council. All living together on the same political planet, ensuring that there is a certain degree of consistency between what we have promised the world and what we can actually achieve. In the past few months of my work, I have heard assurances that we will become more involved in Latin America; I have heard promises that if an agreement is reached in the Middle East peace process, we will pay for it. I have also heard of our intention to establish a stability pact in the South Caucasus. And I have heard the commitment that we intend to safeguard democracy in Indonesia by providing greater support to that country. How do we resolve this issue? And this is not a reference to any of the political disputes of the recent past. I believe we should return to this question repeatedly in the coming weeks and months. One of the reasons I am so passionate about implementing effective reform of our external assistance programs is that I don't want to find myself in a situation again where someone asks a question like the one about the deep gap between rhetoric and reality, and the answer is, ""Oh, we know you're not exactly working very effectively, we know you haven't fulfilled all your commitments, we know there's some money left in your pocket."" I want us to be able to say, ""It's not like that anymore."	de
"Similarly, the Treaties do not define the concept of author. The Commission has also failed to respond to questions about what definition it intends to act on and whether it intends to resolve foreseeable conflicts by imposing its definition of the legal concept on others. One of the most delicate issues is the public interest: will the transposition and application of the WIPO Convention lead to the privatization of creation? And finally, the question of the relationship between the TRIPS and the WIPO Convention must be clarified. The Commission's silence in this regard also requires clarification. If an announced parliamentary debate contributes nothing to clarifying the issues or to adopting positions, then we should at least abstain! Report by Graefe zu Baringdorf (A5-0015/2000) Following the BSE and dioxin scandals, food safety issues are taking center stage. GMOs continue to present many uncertainties regarding their environmental impact on human and animal health. Therefore, where scientific certainty is lacking, the precautionary principle must prevail. A more in-depth study of the use of biotechnology is required, and it should no longer be ""packaged"" for sale in the name of profit for some multinationals in the sector. Furthermore, profit has been the driving force behind the current food safety crises. The rapporteur places himself within this framework, legally framing the issue of GMOs in animal feed, recalling that they ""can only be authorized if they are harmless to human health and the environment."" Furthermore, he believes that ""genetically modified additives must be clearly indicated as such on all labels, administrative documents, or other accompanying documents."" This will allow for greater control and traceability of these additives and guarantee consumer freedom of choice. Following the Montreal Agreement on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), I consider it positive that the rapporteur has included these issues in his report, and I therefore voted in favor of it. Stenzel report (A5-0034/2000) Mr. President, I would like to give a very brief explanation of vote, on behalf of the PPE Group, regarding the report on Equal. We followed a voting list that was exactly the same as the one previously agreed upon with the Socialist Group. That group changed its mind, which is why the report is now less clear than it would otherwise have been. This is why we abstain. We want the report on Equal, which is very important for refugees as well as for the elderly, the disabled, and women, to continue as normal. It is regrettable that the procedure has resulted in this report receiving such unfavorable attention in this plenary session. I am convinced that the rapporteur's nationality played a role, something that should not happen in this Parliament. It is truly contrary to European values, and certainly contrary to the values so often spoken about in this Parliament."	es
Given the position we took in Seattle, I am surprised by the EU's silence on the failure to implement the trade facilitation measures already agreed for developing countries in the GATT negotiations, including in the vital textile sector. Regarding the Common Agricultural Policy, the biggest culprit, no assessment of the development impact of the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms has been carried out. The scandal surrounding the export refund system is well known: 54,000 tons of surplus, subsidized beef were dumped to West African markets, resulting in a 50% drop in producer prices for local cattle farmers. Currently, 300,000 tons of beef are in storage. Who will be the next victim? I welcome Mr Amado's statement this morning, in which he highlighted the problems surrounding the failure to budget for the EDF, and called for a more active role for the Development Council and for development priorities to be taken into account as a central element of the new Common Foreign and Security Policy. I also welcome the Council's 1992 statement, its 1997 resolution, and the subsequent amendments to the Treaty on European Union. To date, the necessary measures have not been taken. For this reason, we are calling for annual reports, an interdepartmental working group to meet once a year, and an appeals procedure to ensure that the necessary measures are actually taken. I would like to ask Mr Nielson to address these points of the resolution directly in his summary. Mr President, I would just like to say something about the link between development cooperation and agriculture. In recent years, a significant proportion of funds have been channeled into agricultural and livestock development in developing countries, particularly in the Lomé countries. The results are certainly not what we expected. What could be the reason for this? I think the main cause is the lack of a consistent agricultural policy in certain developing countries, although this certainly does not apply to all. The Commission has an important role to play in developing such a policy. No farmer, anywhere in the world, will produce anything if prices are too low. Governments in developing countries are always faced with a difficult choice: whom should they support, the farmers or the people in the big cities who want to buy cheap food? This delicate balance must be struck jointly with the Commission, and not by the Commission alone. In most of the countries where the Commission is active, development aid is also provided by the Member States themselves. Member States' policies must not conflict with Commission policy. The Commission's delegations in developing countries must play a leading role in developing this political dialogue and ensure that all countries are on the same track. Particular attention must also be paid to the cost of inputs. Far too often, artificial fertilizers, veterinary medicines, and many other things are provided free of charge to farmers. Once the project has ended after five years, this policy of giving gifts also comes to an end. Therefore, the cost element should be addressed from the outset in the policy of all projects. As far as I know, this is far from always the case.	de
"My second question concerns Africa, which, unlike all other continents, is also not mentioned in Shaping the New Europe. In Africa, we have the most refugees in the world, the greatest poverty, and a devastating AIDS epidemic. I know that Commissioner Nielson and others are doing good work in this area, but the Commission as a whole must pay more attention to this continent, including in its strategic objectives. Finally, let me underline that I welcome the Commission statement, which stresses for the first time that the EU is prepared to take unilateral measures to give developing countries greater access to our markets. My question is: when will this happen? Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a document that is of crucial importance for the future and destiny of Europe. However, among all the points mentioned, two closely intertwined aspects pose an immediate challenge for us: peace and stability in Europe and outside Europe. These objectives must be pursued as a priority, as has long been our common aspiration, but we must also make it clear that they cannot be achieved without enlargement, even if it entails costs. Today, we are called upon to choose for the coming decades between a Europe that is less rich but a beacon of peace and civilization for the entire planet, and a perhaps richer Europe without a vision of the future. However, these objectives can only be achieved if, as a result of the Intergovernmental Conference ending in a year, a constitutional reform takes shape, conferring appropriate and genuine powers on the Commission, which must not merely execute the decisions of the Council or the co-decisions of Parliament, but must assume the role of a genuine European government. Parliament should be the leading advocate of this reform if it truly wishes to expand its role as the voice of the will of the Union's citizens and assume the central function required of a truly democratic and highly integrated Union. Furthermore, the Commission can only be held accountable for the commitments it has assumed within the limits of the powers actually conferred on it. Without these prospects, Europe would face a hopeless future. Madam President, Mr. President of the Commission, we can only welcome the ambitious goals announced, which are in line with the challenges facing Europe. I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin Wall to be the most important event of the end of this century. This event lays the foundation for enlargement. However, I would prefer to use the word ""enlargement"" rather than ""reunification,"" because it seems to me to have a much stronger political significance. You are taking up the idea of focusing your work more closely on core tasks and making this an objective of your reforms. Essentially, it is about applying the principle of subsidiarity. The clear application of this principle can only reinforce the measures implemented and give citizens a clear understanding of each level of responsibility. But, Mr. Prodi, it is one thing to announce this, quite another to implement it!"	de
"As in Spain in April 1998, and as in Brittany and the Vendée since last December, an exceptional natural area is once again seriously threatened. In its resolutions, the European Parliament constantly draws attention to this type of danger, which threatens our environment, disrupts our ecosystem, and once again destabilizes populations. This new catastrophe raises the problem of integrating the EU environmental acquis for the candidate countries. The obstacles that the authorities of these states, still environmentally fragile, must overcome are numerous. First, prevention of this type of discharge must be improved by remediating the most critical industrial sites. Second, these countries should be able to have sufficient technical means to halt such pollution and reduce its scope. Finally, they should be able to implement recovery programs for the most affected and sensitive areas. Today, the banks and waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted. For this reason, the European Union must concentrate its efforts and exert pressure to ensure that all candidate countries adapt to EU environmental protection standards. But above all, what is at stake are the technologies and resources available to prevent and quickly and effectively address these types of disasters. I hope our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility. The environment must be a priority within the framework of the reunification of the European continent. It must be at the heart of our partners' political will. The implementation of high environmental standards will not only allow for the development of important industrial and technological sectors, but will also simultaneously bring about favorable social and economic consequences and improve public health standards. The efforts already undertaken must be strengthened. The European continent must express its solidarity, and responsibilities must be clearly defined within the framework of the ""polluter pays"" principle. Mr. President, when the Doñana disaster occurred, the non-governmental organization World Wide Fund for Nature presented us with a report on the number of these types of ponds in Europe. We all know that there are an enormous number of these types of ponds, which are an ecological bomb and affect the supply of drinking water, the ecological wealth, and also the economic future of these areas. I was in Doñana after the spill and saw how agriculture, fishing, and the lives of the citizens of the surrounding area were greatly compromised. Therefore, I believe that the European Union must, first of all, analyze the situation of these ponds and rigorously record their number in Europe. It must proceed to include these ponds in Community law, in the directives related to waste, and use the principle of prevention to prevent this from happening again. Otherwise, we will be continually endangering the ecological wealth of our continent. Mr. President, this disaster at the Romanian mine encompasses a vast hydrogeological area with rivers and streams in Romania, Hungary, Serbia, and Bulgaria. The release of 100,000 cubic meters of water contaminated with cyanide and heavy metals into the ecosystem will have enormous consequences for the inhabitants of these regions, for the flora and fauna, for agriculture, for tourism, and for the entire ecosystem and biological diversity."	es
It should be remembered that at the Conference on Rural Development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996, rural development was defined as one of the priorities of the European Union, insofar as it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the entire rural fabric (infrastructure, public and private services, etc.). In this context, we deplored in committee the appropriations allocated to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increase in the budget for this Community initiative, so that it would be in line with the previous Leader I and Leader II initiatives. Compared to the latter initiative, which had a limited duration of 6 years, the budget allocated to Leader +, for a duration of 7 years, is 50%. This is unacceptable in view of the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid as provided for in the CAP reform following the Berlin agreements. Finally, among the priority parameters that will be introduced at European level to enable local registrations, particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects that have already been carried out by LAGs under the Leader II initiative, but which have not been able to come to fruition due to the timetable and the complexity of the planned management arrangements. (The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) Additives in animal feedingstuffs The next item is the report (A5-0015/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC on additives in animal feedingstuffs (COM(1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS)). Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, Directive 70/524 currently provides for different treatment of high-tech additives when it comes to replacing existing authorisations. The Commission is now proposing to harmonise the authorisation procedures so that substances authorised before 1988 are placed on an equal footing with those authorised now. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development agrees on this point. However, the directive also covers the authorisation of antibiotics, other medicinal substances, growth promoters and genetically modified organisms. This is a matter of health and not simply a matter of harmonisation of legislation. The Committee on Agriculture is therefore of the opinion that the legal basis – Article 37 – is not admissible here and that the Commission should instead propose a legal basis based on Article 152, which provides for codecision by Parliament. We have asked the opinion of our Legal Affairs Committee, which has indicated that, regarding this harmonisation of legislation, Article 37 would be sufficient in this case. However, we, the Committee on Agriculture, have not limited ourselves to addressing this harmonisation of legislation; we have tabled another amendment, taking into account the fact that this proposal also concerns genetically modified organisms, and this amendment addresses the issue of content and therefore also the health of the population. We negotiated with the Commission for two years on the Seeds Directive and we have reached a compromise that regulates the release of genetically modified organisms in this directive. In doing so, we started from the text that serves as the basis for this Directive 70/524. Mr Byrne, we do not understand why the Commission is undertaking harmonisations and not also providing for the harmonisation of the text concerning genetically modified organisms.	fr
"Why not establish a kind of technological convergence criterion in Lisbon, according to which Member States should increase their research and development expenditure to at least 2.5% of their GDP within five years, which would still be below the current share of the USA? In this context, I would also like to welcome Commissioner Philippe Busquin's initiative to create a European Research Area. Better living conditions, employment, and the quality of employment will continue to depend heavily on our ability to stimulate European research. A genuine European patent, the development of venture capital, and support for start-up companies would also be crucial to this. President Prodi responded yesterday evening to my remarks about Europe's future deficit. However, I believe he misunderstood me, because I was not accusing the Portuguese Presidency or the Commission of lacking vision, but rather speaking of the fear of the future that grips many of our fellow citizens in a rapidly changing world. We are all aware that the development of the information society represents a paradigm shift. However, in a world where 1.5 billion people still live without electricity, the inclusion of all the world's people in the internet society is not achievable in the immediate future. The greatest challenge facing humanity is to avoid the division into ""info-rich"" and ""info-poor"" countries, to prevent the emergence of societies in which, as my friend Claude Desama aptly put it, digital divides are the new social divides. The annual legislative program is the most concrete expression of the key constitutional and political powers of the European Commission, which grant it the exclusive right of initiative. Such powers must always be legitimate and clearly justified. As in all previous years, this year's work program fails to provide a detailed justification for each of the numerous newly proposed measures. The 15-page general summary certainly does not do justice to the 500 initiatives listed in the appendix. The ELDR will therefore in future insist on a clear justification for all measures announced in the work programme, as well as a corresponding dedicated parliamentary debate. Above all, we are concerned with demonstrating that each new proposal has been thoroughly scrutinized to ensure it complies with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. We will also be seeking sector-specific debates in the European Parliament's special committees. In other words, it is high time that the somewhat antiquated procedure by which this crucial programme document is drafted and debated was given a complete overhaul. Mr President, I would like to thank the President of the Commission for speaking to us twice within 24 hours. Yesterday evening, he stated clearly that the outlook for the European economy over the next two to three years is very positive and that the unexpectedly above-average growth rates will make it easier for us to achieve the objectives of this annual legislative programme. In his intervention this morning, the President of the Commission raises three issues that concern me. The first concerns subsidiarity, which our group insists on very strongly, and the Liberals have already pointed out, that each individual proposal must be shown to be in Europe's interest."	de
"I don't know if this information is correct, but we in the EPP-ED Group would certainly be grateful if this item were removed, because Parliament has already addressed this issue on several occasions. There are also resolutions against such a tax. That is why my group is requesting that this item be removed from the agenda. Thank you very much, Mr. Poettering. We now come to Mr. Wurtz, who is speaking against the motion. Madam President, I would first like to point out that what Mr. Poettering is saying is not entirely logical. Firstly, he is lecturing the Socialist Group because it is questioning a very clear and unambiguous decision of the Conference of Presidents. And now he is doing exactly the same thing. We discussed it, and we agreed, only the EPP Group and the Liberals did not. And I also pointed out, as the other Presidents will remember, that the issue is not whether we are for or against the Tobin tax, but whether we are prepared to listen to what the Commission and the Council think about it. That is not too much to ask. I therefore reiterate the suggestion that we maintain this oral question to the Commission and the Council in order to ascertain once and for all the opinion of these two institutions on this relatively modest proposal, which would send an important signal to the public, particularly after the furore following the failure of the Seattle Conference. We shall now vote on the PPE/DE Group's request to remove the oral question on the capital tax from the agenda. (Parliament rejected the request by 164 votes to 166, with seven abstentions.) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for drumming up support for this debate. Thank you very much. Madam President! Has my vote been counted? I couldn't cast it electronically because I don't have the card. I voted ""for."" Indeed, if you add the two Members who spoke up, the result is... Madam President! The Presidency has announced the result of the vote. No changes are possible. Madam President, during the earlier vote on the Commission's strategic plan—don't worry, I will abide by your decision on this matter—I asked to be allowed to speak on behalf of my group before the vote. This did not happen. I would welcome the opportunity to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my group at the end of this item of business. This is an important matter. Perhaps it would be useful to record how what we have just done is received by each member in the light of their own political analysis. Madam President, I do not want to reopen the debate, but I also asked to comment on Mr Barón Crespo's request. You did not call on me either. I regret that, but the vote has been taken, the decision has been made, so let's leave things as they are. I am sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox. I had not seen that you had asked to speak. But the positions have become clear and will be recorded in the Minutes."	de
"The honourable Member is therefore quite right to point out the strategic importance of these regions. We are involved in programmes in the region which also have an impact on the environment. There is a direct link between our food programmes and structural reforms in agriculture and poverty alleviation. These programmes themselves are intended to help put these countries' agriculture on a more solid footing and put an end to overexploitation. We should continue to give priority to this ecological aspect in the future. We also note carefully that the honourable Member who drafted the question applauded the Commissioner's answer. That is not usual. Furthermore, the Commissioner did not cite a bibliography in this case. Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your contributions today. Question No 35 by (H-0778/99): Subject: Greek Action Plan for Employment According to the results of the evaluation of the action plans for employment, Greece and Italy are the countries most affected by the Commission's criticisms, both as regards the inconsistency of the plans and of the measures and policies to support employment. The report points out that in Greece and Italy the objectives for improving employability have not been achieved and it is uncertain whether the policies to be implemented satisfy the guidelines for preventing and combating long-term unemployment. With regard to Greece, it is also pointed out that there is no programme of medium- and long-term measures to reduce the tax burden and social security contributions in the employment sector and to ensure satisfactory use of ESF resources to support employment policy, and that, moreover, precise employment figures are not available. Can the Commission state whether the Greek government has made any concrete commitments, and which ones, regarding how it will tackle the problem of youth unemployment and long-term unemployment, and whether it has established and is implementing an appropriate system for locating, recording, and monitoring unemployment fluctuations, or whether most measures continue to be limited to enumerating unemployment? Regarding Mr. Papayannakis' question: As part of the 1999 employment package, the Commission made certain recommendations to Greece to make employment promotion measures more effective. These recommendations essentially suggest intensifying efforts to reform public services in problem areas, improving the statistical recording system, and implementing preventive policies in accordance with Guidelines 1 and 2 of the employment package. As part of its employment policy, the Greek government announced two concrete programs in 1999: ""Yes to Working Life"" and ""Back to Work."" Since the final results for these programs are not yet available, we cannot yet say whether the quantitative targets have been achieved. The Greek government now acknowledges the problem of its inability to measure unemployment fluctuations. It has therefore committed itself to, first, restructuring the public employment offices; second, creating efficient employment promotion centers—a program to this end has been initiated but is not yet completed; and third, introducing electronic employment cards and implementing appropriate computer systems to monitor the implementation of all these policies."	de
It's about strengthening banking supervision. It's about clarifying liability for transactions. It's about a regulatory framework at the international level. It's about reviewing national laws to determine whether they comply with the Basel Committee's rules and how these can be more widely disseminated. I have a major problem with one central point in this resolution, which we cannot accept in its current form. That is point 9. Having listened to the Commissioner, we know that the Commission's expertise will lead to a rejection of the Tobin tax. If the expertise, this debate, and the arguments are as we have presented them, and as I believe them to be correct, then keeping the Commission on the matter for another six months and thus causing uncertainty in the financial and capital markets is irresponsible. The capital market doesn't need uncertainty from us; it needs clarity from us. We therefore reject point 9 and call for a split vote. Madam President, the debate about taxing short-term financial transactions is not new. We've been debating the Tobin tax proposal for twenty years, and yet this question remains perennially relevant, because we need truly concrete and honest answers based on careful studies. We need to know how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term financial transactions actually is. This question truly takes on a different dimension today, when 1.5 trillion US dollars roam the world 24 hours a day in search of attractive investments, and at most 3% of this is connected to the real economy. We are concerned about the stability of the financial markets, not for the sake of the financial markets, but because it also affects our own growth, our own investments, and our own jobs in the European Union. Here, we must ask what instruments we can use to truly create a certain order here that has so far been lacking. We have contributed everything we can to the liberalization of financial transactions, but to this day we don't have a functioning set of rules, and we have had to experience this bitterly with the effects of the Asian and Latin American crises. It is therefore high time that we consider, on the one hand, supervisory rules and, on the other, transparency in the financial markets and their information. It is important that we know which players exist and what their creditworthiness is. We must also ask ourselves whether there is not a requirement for fiscal justice. At a time when the tax burden on labor is increasing across Europe and internationally, we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of capital gains, and we must also address the question of the taxation of short-term financial transactions. I truly believe it is necessary that we receive a thorough report and conclusion from the Commission so that we, as the European Parliament, can determine whether we need to ensure that the European Union, together with the USA and Japan, truly achieves international solidarity in order to make the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure.	de
Therefore, without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decisions that take place outside its decision-making centre and directly affect the European Union's development policy, it will certainly be difficult to develop a more coherent European Union policy in relation to development objectives. The European Parliament's input and reflection will certainly be timely and welcome here as well. Let me begin by saying a few words about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and the ACP countries. I would like to point out that participating in these negotiations was a very positive experience. I saw Member States working as a team, a great experience indeed. Both sides were deeply satisfied at the end of the negotiations, not only because they had come to an end, but also because we all knew that we had achieved something together, the EU and the 71 ACP countries. The world needs this, and the signal sent is very positive in the context of the general discussion on globalization. I will highlight some of the novelties contained in this new agreement. We are explicitly addressing the issue of corruption; we are establishing a framework for dealing with the immigration problem, for the very first time. We are encouraging participatory approaches, ensuring that civil society is consulted on the reforms and policies that the EU should support. We are refocusing development policies on poverty reduction strategies. We are basing the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country's needs, but also on an evaluation of their policy performance. We are creating an investment mechanism to support private sector development. We are streamlining instruments and introducing a new rotating programming system that allows the Community and beneficiary countries to regularly adjust their cooperation programs. We are decentralizing administrative, and sometimes financial, responsibilities to local levels with the aim of improving cooperation. We are improving the policy framework for trade and investment development. We are strengthening cooperation in all areas of trade importance, including new issues such as labor standards and the relationship between the environment and trade. After Seattle, I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements. I now turn to some of the more important points. First, the agreement on political issues. The new agreement will involve a firm commitment on both sides to good government as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, a subject for regular dialogue in a sector that enjoys the active support of the Community. Second, a new procedure has been devised for dealing with violations of human rights, democratic principles, and the rule of law. Compared with the current procedure, the new procedure places greater emphasis on the responsibility of the State concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process, with the aim of conducting a productive dialogue leading to measures to redress the situation. In cases of particular urgency, namely serious violations of one of these fundamental elements, measures will be taken immediately and notification will be made to the other party.	fr
Of course, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper functioning of the internal market and of the Economic and Monetary Union. However, as the rapporteur points out, such aid is sometimes indispensable and can, in addition to the survival of certain businesses, contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158). However, it is clear that it must be monitored and this task falls to the European Commission. The aid that the Member States of the Union devote each year to the sectors in question reached, in the period 1995-1997, a total of EUR 95 billion, of which 40% was for the manufacturing sector. This aid has fallen significantly compared with the previous period, 1993-1995 (a decrease of 13% in the total amount and from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount dedicated to aid for the manufacturing sector). This reduction in aid is mainly explained by the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder. Like the rapporteur, I also regret that the data presented in the report do not include all state aid. The European Commission must remedy these shortcomings as quickly as possible. It must also work with the Member States to improve the quality of the data in good time, i.e. for the ninth census. It would be a good thing if the Commission were to publish a register showing the amounts of state aid by Member State. I also regret that the European Parliament is completely excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid. To remedy this situation, the European Commission must undertake to submit regular reports to us. I will conclude on one aspect of the use of state aid that I find particularly dangerous: aid that results in the transfer of a business from one Member State to another, with the risk of subsidy hunting without these contributing to the achievement of the EU's common objectives. For this reason, I hope that the next survey of state aid will include an assessment of the impact of such aid on employment and on the industrial and craft sectors in the beneficiary countries. Langen report (A5-0073/1999) This morning, in the context of the important debate on competition, I expressed my opinion on Mr Langen's text concerning the application in 1998 of the sixth steel aid code. As the Court of Justice recognised in its judgment of 3 May 1996, the steel sector is particularly sensitive to distortions of competition. It was therefore legitimate to introduce a system of state aid to this sector in order to guarantee the survival of viable firms, even though Article 4(c) of the ECSC Treaty prohibits all state aid to the steel industry. This is, in fact, the subject of the sixth steel aid code. At the same time, of course, it is essential to avoid any threat to the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid. State aid should therefore continue to be granted only for research, development, environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closures.	it
Madam President, I would also like to applaud the Commission's initiative in presenting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years, although I hope that it intends to correct, in subsequent documents, the excessive generalities and imprecision of the text we are analysing today. Having said that, Madam President, I would again denounce the absence of fisheries policy, even though I am hardly being listened to. It is truly surprising that the Commission does not include among its strategic objectives for the coming years the process of reviewing one of its common policies with a view to the reform that is due to take place in 2002. This review process is, without a shadow of a doubt, the most important event that will affect the fisheries sector for many years to come. But, at first glance, this is not the opinion of the Commission, which is responsible for presenting to the Council and Parliament, before the end of 2001, the report on the operation of the common fisheries policy over the last decade, on the basis of which the Council will have to take the appropriate decisions to amend it. In fact, the review process has already begun for many groups and institutions, such as the European Parliament, which, in 1998, already dictated and approved a report listing all the problems and defects currently present in the common fisheries policy. We have repeatedly asked for a minimum timetable for this review, but we have not received a response. Less than two years is not much, if we also remember that the fisheries policy is experiencing an anomalous situation with regard to internal market standards and that a solution to these anomalies should be found within the framework of the reform procedure. Therefore, Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I ask that this point, which is of vital importance for such an important sector of the European Union, be taken into account in this strategy and in these strategic objectives for the next five years. Madam President, I would also like to congratulate Commissioner Prodi on his programme. I am particularly pleased that he has recognized this virtuous circle of sustained growth: the information society within an expanding European market with, in addition, a functioning single currency will give us the opportunity to truly develop prosperity, innovation, entrepreneurship and, yes – most importantly – sustainable jobs with very high added value for European citizens. I have one observation, not a criticism, to make regarding Commissioner Prodi's statement this morning, namely that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy. We must not take anything for granted as regards how to achieve the restructuring of the European economy. After all, what is social justice without full employment? Full employment is the best way to achieve social justice for our citizens. It is a fundamental priority for us, and one on which we must focus our efforts.	fr
This is proof, if any were needed, that an immature diplomacy, which defends no interests, except perhaps particular ones, caught between the theology of free trade, pressure groups and more or less friendly NGOs, is not only effective, but dangerous. Finally, a word on the general inspiration of the Corrie report. Today, the Joint Assembly is considered, let us not hide it, as an obstacle to international free trade by theologians in Geneva and Washington. This was an opportunity to recall that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the countries of the South should be developed and strengthened. This opportunity was missed by the Corrie report and, regrettably, we must sanction the fact that it was lost to this extent. Mr. President, by way of conclusion and summary, I would like to highlight three essential aspects of this debate. First, the idea that emerges very strongly from all the interventions is that globalization accentuates regional imbalances and social inequalities, that it increases poverty. Something must therefore be done, otherwise tensions will be aggravated and mechanisms will emerge that trigger conflicts that jeopardize international peace and stability. Second, from this perspective, it would be important to give another dimension to development policies by promoting their role in correcting imbalances and mitigating inequalities. I think everyone agrees on the crucial importance of the European Union's role in development policies at the international level. Everyone recognizes, and this was the theme of today's debate, that for the European Union to assume a more active and leading role in development policies at the international level, it will necessarily have to strengthen the coherence of its various policies that contribute to development objectives. I believe that some of the interventions have also clearly emphasised the fact that this responsibility for the coherence of European Union policies does not fall exclusively on the Council, the Commission or Parliament; on the contrary, it will have to be the subject of concerted reflection and legislative and institutional preparation, both at Commission and Council level, as well as at the level of the European Parliament itself. Some Members have also put forward suggestions, such as the creation of an observatory or a working group to support the action of the various policies in the specific area of development. As this was one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency's programme, I would finally like to stress that it is also important to record the assertion that it is necessary to promote development policy in the context of European Union policies and particularly in the context of its external policy. We believe that this is absolutely essential; Without this, it will not be possible to develop a consistent action in terms of policy coherence, if we are not able to give a leading role to development policies as an instrument for affirming principles and values which shape Europe's affirmation in the international system.	fr
We in the Community, in the European Union, have an important role to play here. SAVE is the only Community-wide program dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy. It is based on non-technical elements and contributes to the development of an energy efficiency infrastructure. The program's goal is to create an environment that encourages investment and energy efficiency. At this point, we must also realize that there is certainly market potential for energy conservation in industry. We have heard a lot about the competitive difficulties with renewable energy sources, but energy conservation can save companies, indeed everywhere, money, so that shouldn't be a problem. This is something we can all support. I must say that, much like with motherhood, we all support it, but sometimes do very little to provide concrete help to mothers or those committed to energy conservation. We could actually do more, given the major commitments we have made to reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases, and to reducing our dependence on imported energy. We are not taking the kind of action that citizens want to see. We are not making the necessary connection so that citizens can actually take action at home, in the office, or in their company to support measures to combat climate change. If we could get that message across, that would be a very exciting thing. I would like to thank everyone again who has taken part in this conciliation process. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Ahern again for her work as rapporteur on this draft, because she, with the cooperation of the other Members of Parliament, has helped to ensure that we end up with a very sensible result, which in some respects even improves on one or two of the Commission's own proposals and, of course, on what the Council had initially accepted from a budgetary point of view. As Mrs Ahern quite rightly pointed out, both the SAVE and ALTENER programme budgets are primarily symbolic, since the weight of the budget rests with the Länder, the Member States of the Union, the regions and, in some cases, even local authorities. But in any case, despite their relatively small size, the programmes have an important symbolic value, which shows that there is a will within the Community as a whole to support this type of measure, which will help us genuinely fulfil our Kyoto commitments and, at the same time, achieve greater diversification of our energy sources, greater security of supply and, in the case of SAVE, reduce consumption and achieve greater efficiency in energy use, thus helping us to achieve the objectives set. Furthermore, with the SAVE programme, greater efficiency and energy saving, and with the ALTENER programme, renewable energies, there is a technological challenge of the utmost importance which, from an economic point of view, can bring significant opportunities for industry and also for job creation in our countries and, consequently, throughout the Union.	de
To this end, we have submitted several amendments, and we hope Parliament will accept them: first, to offer the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia exemption from customs duties on its exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction in customs duties applied to Macedonia on European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at Macedonian borders is accepted; second, to encourage FYROM with appropriate financial support to integrate its currency into the euro, as a first step towards the Europeanization of its entire economy, with the ultimate aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system; third, that the aid and assistance that the world must give to the region, and therefore also to Macedonia, must clearly be multilateral in nature, without the recipient country being conditioned by obligations to the donor country. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we hope that the agreement will achieve all its intended objectives, but we cannot delude ourselves that peace, stability, and prosperity in southeastern Europe will be achieved without a prior study of the issues that pose the major problems we are trying to eliminate. I am referring to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, the need to engage Serbia in the regional reconciliation process, and, why not, a new discussion about relations between the European Union, NATO, and the United Nations, within the framework of this new balance that must be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty, which, in my opinion, must bring about a modification of the United Nations Charter itself. Mr. President, Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has made everything worse. That certainly applies, and above all, to the relationship between the European Union and the Western Balkans. Many hopes have been raised since then. That applies both there and here. There, because—whether we like it or not—in addition to the question of direct aid, the question is: what does Europe intend to do with us now? Is membership in the offing? This is something that is widely discussed in all these countries. But here in the European Union too, many hopes have been raised. If we do this well, it will be the first test of a genuine common foreign and security policy. Will the European Union succeed in acting jointly for the first time and developing a joint policy for such a complicated agreement? Likewise, the question is whether the European Union has learned its lessons from the poor experiences in Bosnia regarding aid and the somewhat better experiences in Kosovo. Can we improve it, based on the experiences in Macedonia and four other countries? Against this backdrop of very high hopes, I think I'm not exaggerating if I say that this first step, the stabilization and association agreement with Macedonia, is of crucial importance. It is not the Union's only contribution. Next comes the debate on the stability pact, the Cara program, and short-term financing. We are now discussing the Stability and Association Agreements, that is, the medium-term perspective.	es
"The season risks going into a loss and giving rise to a very serious crisis at the end of the year. It was therefore fully justified for Parliament to draft a new resolution to which our group has made an extremely important contribution, a resolution that emphasizes a number of points that those working in the field consider absolutely essential. First of all, those who pollute must assume all their responsibilities. Our resolution therefore calls for the application of two principles: firstly, that of ""the polluter cleans up"", because it is unacceptable that the clean-up of coasts polluted by a load of hydrocarbons is not carried out at the expense of the owner of the load, but at the expense of public bodies, i.e. the taxpayers or, better said, the victims. Secondly, there is the principle of ""the polluter pays"". Their responsibility, our resolution specifies, must extend to the sectors and businesses in the fishing, marine culture and aquaculture sectors. This is essential and means that any polluter cannot claim to limit the amount of compensation to the victims based on the ceiling set by the IOPCF courtesy of the big oil companies. If the IOPCF ceiling is insufficient, if it is clearly underestimated, it must be increased. Well, our resolution demands this. If the increase is insufficient, the polluter will have to finance the rest. It would be particularly unfair to allow an oil company, whose profits this year are around ten billion francs, to deny full compensation to the victims, the vast majority of whom are small businesses and employees. The affected populations, Commissioner, expect concrete signs of solidarity at European level. Our resolution calls on the Commission to take the necessary measures to help repair the damage inflicted on the fishing sector, which has been hit by the consequences of the disaster. Blue Europe, the CFP, must now demonstrate that, beyond the constraints it imposes on fishermen, solidarity is not an unfamiliar sentiment and the European Union must also participate in the environmental recovery of affected wetlands and coastal zones, whose biological value is of interest to the Union as a whole. Commissioner Fischler has just said that he would welcome France's requests and I am pleased about that. In the crucial chapter of marine pollution, we must play a spurring role. Twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, laxity and irresponsibility continue to reign undisturbed in Europe in the field of maritime safety, with the resulting consequences of repeated oil spills. This time we must not let inertia get the better of us. We must quickly define a general framework for maritime safety in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity and we must finally put an end to this infernal spiral of generalised irresponsibility. Mr. President, the economy of the Western Atlantic is in shambles, contaminated by Erika diesel. Fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, tourism operators, local and regional authorities are growing impatient waiting for help and treatment of the wreck which, we are told, continues to cause spills and is a real time bomb."	it
Mr President, the question posed by Mr Karamanou is an extremely serious one, it must be said. We are perfectly aware of the difficult and dramatic humanitarian situation in Kosovo, as well as the problem of displaced persons in the region, who come from Kosovo, with the repercussions this has on children's health and mortality rates. It is clear to me that the European Union has made a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid efforts of the international community. As you know, the European Community has provided a total of EUR 378 million to the province of Kosovo alone, to which must be added the national contributions of the various Member States. This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and the health system, as well as water treatment. Furthermore, as you know, the European Union contributes EUR 66.3 million to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 1999. I believe the honourable Member is aware that, given the necessary division of labour among international donors, the health sector in Kosovo falls under the responsibility of the World Health Organization. This organization is fully aware, based on the reports it has drawn up, of the alarming situation regarding children's health. It has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity wards and hospitals. However, we are aware that this situation is very far from being satisfactorily resolved; that it has a dynamic and a dimension that also affects other areas of health, especially children's health. This is a political situation, not just a technical one, but rather a solution to the political situation, because there are dimensions here, which must not be hidden, which have repercussions in terms of what is, until now, the inability of the international community to put into practice the functioning of a multi-ethnic society in Kosovo, which has had a detrimental effect on the improvement of the health system in this region. I thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for your reply, which complements what Commissioner Patten said yesterday on this subject. However, Mr President, the amount of EUR 378 million, which you say was allocated in 1999, has in fact proved to be completely insufficient for the creation of basic human conditions in Kosovo, particularly as regards the provision of health services. Do you not think, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the mere fact that infant mortality has increased is a stigma for the European continent, a shame that should mobilise us all to ensure that the aid we provide is more effective and generous? Certainly, the situation was not idyllic before the bombings, far from it, but it has deteriorated very significantly since NATO's intervention as far as the natural and human environment are concerned. In these circumstances, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is it not a moral matter for us to strive to create humane conditions for the so-suffering inhabitants of Kosovo, and above all to keep all the promises we have made?	fr
"And if we let a group of high-level officials act as a hub for exchanging experiences in coordinating and evaluating social and labour market policy, we will learn from it. The Commission communication, which we are discussing today, and which was the starting point for the Council decision in November, provides a balanced presentation of how we can have a more qualified debate, how we can learn more about the challenges that Member States will face in the area of social policy in the coming years, years in which we will have ageing populations and we will feel the effects of enlargement. We already have major social problems and high social expenditure on public budgets, which is a problem for many Member States. If we do not start reforms, we risk eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is certainly the safest basis for good social protection. It is therefore sensible to put these issues on the agenda. In the debate on the coordination of social policy within the European Union, we often use the expression ""social convergence"". We liberals can support the concept of social convergence when it comes to defining, within the European Union, broad common objectives that countries try to achieve through national social policy. It is therefore not a question of harmonisation, but of common objectives. It is a fact that the countries of the European Union have different ways of organising social policy. We have different traditions, there are cultural differences and, despite many common points, there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature of social problems and their extent. For this reason, it is important to underline that social policy is a matter of national competence. Naturally, national policy cannot escape a series of common references concerning the minimum social rights established in the Treaty, the guarantee of free movement of labour without loss of their social rights, respect for the need to coordinate economies and respect for economic cooperation. Coordination and cooperation are therefore necessary. Convergence, however, must be an end and not a means. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, for his very constructive efforts to try to reconcile different positions and secure support for his report. I support the report. There are, however, some points with which I do not fully agree. I do not agree with the call for the Commission to take action against what is called unfair competition between social and tax systems, if this action is to be used to curb new ideas, the development and improvement of the efficiency of our social systems, or to prevent the reduction of excessively high tax burdens in many Member States of the European Union. I am sceptical about the detailed regulation that could be achieved if the Commission were to take a position on the scope and quality of childcare and care for the elderly, just as I am sceptical about the benefit of a common poverty line."	it
This is of no interest to the major groups in this Parliament, nor to most of the trade unions, which are theoretically committed to defending the European civil service but, in practice, are focused on the corporate protection of their own members, using the considerable powers granted to them in a questionable manner. Trade union representatives are on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee, so that the disloyal civil servant risks nothing and so that the Staff Regulations are frozen. Trade union representatives are also, and this is incomprehensible, on the competition selection boards, and I would not be surprised if members of the union were already part of OLAF, which would seriously harm this institution which should, at least formally, offer the guarantee of being super partes. I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is usually intended for other activities and not for debate, confrontation and information. Mr President, when it comes to internal reform, the European Commission is in a difficult position. After the affairs that led to the previous Commission's resignation, expectations are enormous. I sometimes have the impression that the proposals put forward in this House are all the more applauded because they are radical. On the other hand, circumstances cannot be changed overnight with the stroke of a pen. As soon as things have to be implemented, as soon as a few points of detail have to be discussed, difficulties very quickly arise. This is undoubtedly why the Committee on Budgetary Control has had to face more difficulties than expected on this point. However, we have no reason to be ashamed of the result as it appears before you today. On this occasion, I would like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report. If this report manages to avoid being watered down once again by the adoption of several amendments, it will enable us to give the Commission clear and straightforward instructions on several key points. Let us start with the most important instruction. We do not want financial control to be abolished. The financial controller must still be able to do his job before payments are made, not in all circumstances, but in cases where uncertainties and risks exist. The Commission is sending out the wrong signal by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audit. The Commission's organisational structure can easily be changed, but the task becomes more difficult when it has to stick to the legal texts and, in this case, the Financial Regulation. I have not made an exhaustive list, but the Community's Financial Regulation and the implementing provisions relating to it refer in more than 100 different passages to the financial controller, his independence and the tasks assigned to him. This regulation cannot be ignored or circumvented, not even through so-called soft law, as a colleague mentioned during a committee meeting.	fr
It is obvious that some Presidents ignore the show of hands and immediately turn to the electronic voting system. I wonder if this is the correct procedure. I know it takes longer, but shouldn't we always vote by a show of hands first? I assure you, Mr President, that I will be paying close attention to how many hands go up. I hope there will be many by the time the vote takes place.

The environment is in a very, very serious state. Like the previous speakers, I would like to address the economic problem and the financing of projects that, in my opinion, should always be in the public interest. Regarding financing: EUR 613 million is not enough, Commissioner. Even EUR 850 million is not sufficient. At the end of August, I attended a meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, where even EUR 2 million, or 4 trillion lire, was mentioned for eliminating or at least reducing the problem of nicotine addiction. However, the environment is a far more serious, far more important problem than nicotine addiction. I assure you, Commissioner, EUR 850 million—assuming this financial framework is actually approved—is not enough to advance any type of project in practice. Protected areas have been established in many places, and these are a particularly important component of the LIFE programme. But protected areas established with limited financial resources, i.e., without signage, are ineffective and pointless. I therefore call on Parliament and the Commission to pay close attention to this issue. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the beginning of 1999, discussions have been taking place between the various institutions on the proposed regulation for a third phase of the financial instrument for the environment - LIFE. I would like to thank the Committee on the Environment and the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, once again for their good and constructive cooperation on this matter. As a result, I can announce that the Commission approves in principle nine of the fourteen amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment. The Commission particularly welcomes Amendments 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13, on comitology. In this case, Parliament has responded to the Commission's objections to the common position. In principle, the Commission can also accept Amendment 4, which, however, should appear elsewhere in the text. With regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6, I would like to stress that projects for the sustainable management of groundwater and surface water, as well as projects for the reduction of climate-relevant air pollutants, are largely included in LIFE. However, the Commission considers that listing them separately contradicts the original decision to concentrate the proposal on a few priority areas. There is also a risk of overlap with other Community action programmes, such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration. The core measures of this programme – water quality, the city of the future, and innovative products and processes – partly address the same issues. On the budgetary issue, I am pleased with the confidence shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health, Energy, Water and Water Management. Amendment No 12 calls for a larger financial framework than proposed in the common position. I also believe in LIFE's great potential. This instrument should be able to finance good projects with a larger amount than the proposed financial framework. However, the amount indicated in Amendment 12 does not correspond to the budget established on the basis of Agenda 2000. Let me also mention that an expanded financial framework also places greater demands on the Environment Directorate, which will then have to manage a larger number of projects. Furthermore, other programmes decided upon under the codecision procedure must also be taken into account.	de
"However, I would conclude by asking: what will come first? Can we really achieve full employment without unleashing this entrepreneurial talent? If we wait for this to happen, I fear that the major objectives you have outlined before us will not be achieved. Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, I believe that the Lisbon Summit, thanks to your efforts and those of the Commission, can finally become an ambitious and social summit, where the European social model is finally seen as a new engine for European integration and where full employment can become a concrete objective. But if Lisbon wants to become the Summit of these political ambitions, then Lisbon must also become the Summit of methodology. I would like to ask you to pay attention to three points that seem to me to be of essential importance to ensure that this Summit is a significant social summit. First, methodologically, the job creation strategy and the new social security coordination procedure cannot be subordinated to a macroeconomic policy that is focused solely on stability. For me, Mr. President of the Council, this clearly means that the Social Affairs Council should have the same weight as the ECOFIN Council and that political direction must remain in the hands of the European Council itself. Secondly, I would like to strongly support your commitment to setting clear objectives, both with regard to economic growth and job creation. But I would like to add that, if Lisbon is to be a truly social summit, we should be able to specify what we want to do to modernize and strengthen social security. In this area, too, we need ""standards of excellence."" We would like to have a Luxembourg process. Finally, I support the European Commission's ambition to formulate standards on poverty and drastically reduce poverty within ten years. I think it is important that you set objectives in this regard, Mr. President of the Council. In other words, we must encourage all Member States to combat the social exclusion of citizens, not only children but also their parents and the elderly. I wish the Council Presidency the best of luck in achieving its ambitions. Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, Mr. President, the extraordinary Lisbon European Council on employment, economic reform, and social cohesion sets itself, as we have been told, an ambitious, very ambitious goal, at the risk of disappointing our fellow citizens, who are well aware that it is not enough to decree full employment and the eradication of poverty in Europe to achieve this. But ultimately, this summit has great merit: to forge, after Cardiff and Luxembourg, a political will for greater social cohesion, and in particular for the 57 million people living in poverty in our country, including single mothers, large families, and children, to whom, tomorrow, will be added other excluded groups, namely those who will not have access to new fields of knowledge, which will generate new social imbalances."	es
All of this is in line with the principles we have always defended. Thank you, Mr Segni, I am happy to do so. It is entirely in keeping with the position we have always taken as a Parliament. Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to a case that this Parliament has repeatedly addressed. That is the case of Alexander Nikitin. We are all pleased that the court acquitted him and made it clear that access to environmental information is a constitutional right in Russia too. But now he is to be charged again because the public prosecutor is appealing. We know, and we have stated this in many resolutions – especially during the last plenary session last year – that this is not just a legal case and that it is wrong to accuse Alexander Nikitin of criminality and treason because we, as those affected, benefit from his findings. These results form the basis for the European programs to protect the Barents Sea, and therefore I ask you to examine a draft letter outlining the most important facts and to clarify this position in line with the resolutions of the Russian Parliament. Ms. Schroedter, I would be happy to examine the relevant facts once I have received your letter. Madam President, first of all, thank you very much for keeping your word and for the enormous expansion of television channels in our offices during the first session of the new year. However, Madam President, my request has not been met. Although we can now receive two Finnish and one Portuguese channel, we still do not have a Dutch channel. However, I did ask you for a Dutch channel, because we Dutch people also want to follow the news when we are exiled here every month. Therefore, I would like to ask you again to ensure that a Dutch channel is also broadcast. Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can inform you that this item is on the Quaestors' agenda for Wednesday. I hope that a decision will be taken there in your favor. Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not abide by the occupational health and safety regulations it itself has adopted? Why has the air quality in this building not been checked even once since our election? Why has the Committee on Health and Safety at Work not met even once since 1998? Why has there been no fire drill in either the Brussels or Strasbourg Parliament buildings? Why are there no fire safety briefings? Why was nothing done to make the stairs safer after my accident? Why is the smoking ban not enforced in the non-smoking areas? It is a disgrace that we adopt rules that we then do not adhere to ourselves. Mrs Lynne, you are absolutely right, and I will check whether all this is indeed the case. I will also put the matter to the Quaestors. I am sure that they attach great importance to our own compliance with the legislation we adopt. Madam President, Mrs. Díez González and I have raised several questions about certain statements made by Vice-President de Palacio, which were published in a Spanish newspaper.	de
A5-0028/2000, by Mrs Decourrière, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission (COM(99)0479 - C5-0243/99 - 1999/2178(COS)) to the Member States laying down guidelines for a Community initiative concerning trans-European cooperation to promote harmonious and balanced development of the European territory (INTERREG), A5-0024/2000, by Mr Procacci, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the draft communication from the Commission (COM(99)0475 - C5-0259/99 - 1999/2185(COS)) to the Member States laying down guidelines for the Community initiative for rural development (LEADER +), A5-0034/2000, by Mrs Stenzel on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the draft communication from the Commission (COM(99)0476 - C5-0260/99 - 1999/2186(COS)) to the Member States laying down guidelines for Community Initiative Programmes (CIPs) for which Member States are invited to submit proposals for contributions under the EQUAL initiative. Since Mrs McCarthy is slightly late due to the late arrival of her plane, I propose that we hear Mrs Decourrière first. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners and members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I have been instructed to draw up the European Parliament's report on the Community Initiative Programme INTERREG III. In committee we have examined over a hundred amendments and so far 17 have been re-tabled, some of which have already been tabled in committee. Before moving on to discuss the content of the resolution I am proposing to you, I would like to introduce you to the elements that I have taken into consideration and that have guided my work as rapporteur. First of all, I would like to remind you of the role of the INTERREG Community initiative, based on the principle of transnationality and innovation. This programme is a driver of development and of a European dimension. INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives planned for the period 2000-2006 and will have the largest financial package, i.e. 4,875 billion euros compared to the current 3,604 billion. Created in 1990, the INTERREG initiative is based on the desire to prepare the European regions for a Europe without frontiers in the context of the creation of the large single market. With the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996, the INTERREG PIC introduced new elements that contribute to the development of trans-European networks for the transport and distribution of energy. These programmes have encouraged cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation in the European Union, giving priority to balanced development of the Community area. The INTERREG III programme, the guidelines for which the European Commission is submitting to us today, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation No 1260/1999 of the European Community concerning general provisions on the Structural Funds, pursues this objective. It is based on three elements: element A, which organises cross-border cooperation between local authorities in the internal and external border regions of the European Union on the basis of common development strategies, the implementation of which is the responsibility of the Member States and local and regional authorities; element B, which provides for transnational cooperation between national, regional and local authorities in several Member States or countries applying for accession to the European Union in the fields of spatial planning, transport networks and the environment; the implementation of this element is the responsibility of the Member States and national authorities; and element C aimed at organising interregional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries for the networking of experiences on elements A and B as well as cooperation in the field of research and technological development, this aspect which will have to be defined with the European Commission responsible for its implementation.	it
Member States must act quickly and firmly. Our governments must pool financial resources to ensure effective controls and stop dragging out any initiative on maritime safety. The Erika tragedy did not cost lives, but it could have destroyed the lives of many, like the Sea Empress or the Braer. What is certain is that all three accidents caused an ecological disaster. My group stands in solidarity with the people of Brittany, whose region was devastated by the disaster, just as we have stood in solidarity with the people of West Wales and the Shetland Islands on other occasions. It is time to stop showing our solidarity and instead start issuing mandatory mandates to eliminate these ships of shame in favor of safe seas, otherwise, later this year, we will find ourselves once again debating a new motion for a resolution to sink yet another tanker flying a flag of convenience that is plaguing the sea with crude oil. The time for resolutions is over: now is the time to act. Unfortunately, I fear that the Council will remain inactive this time too and we will return to discussing another maritime and ecological disaster in the future. Mr President, every time a disaster like this occurs, people say that it must never happen again. In reality, we cannot prevent accidents at sea, but it is our duty to learn from every accident like this and to apply the lessons learned to reduce future risks. The Erika accident was especially serious for the people of Brittany who were most directly affected, but it had devastating effects on wildlife in much of Europe. According to some sources, it is the worst disaster ever to affect birds in this part of Europe; according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, at least 400,000 birds may have died, probably mostly guillemots. So much tragedy and so much anguish in the images of oil-blackened birds being dumped on beaches by veterinarians, which many of us have seen. We all want the best standards for ships, regardless of their flag. Regulations must be respected, as must the polluter pays principle, so that fines and incentives can be used to put pressure on shipping operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced. I agree with every word the Commissioner says, but the question is how long it will take for measures of the kind she has proposed to be introduced. As a politician, the Commissioner must remind her officials how difficult it would be to have to come back to this House in a year's time, on the occasion of a similar, equally devastating accident, if some of the measures proposed today were still just fine words, having not had the chance to put them into practice. The idea of another similar accident in the future should be the perfect catalyst for the Commissioner and her officials.	it
This House will face one of the most important imperatives that can result from the essential measures taken to ensure that the Commission's resources are equal to its tasks. Last month, as Romano Prodi just said, we launched a comprehensive assessment of the Commission's activities and resources, and we will report in detail on this in September. Our objective is to focus the Commission's work on key policymaking priorities and core activities, in line with our strategic policymaking objectives for the next five years. Inevitably, this will entail identifying activities that could and should be reduced or terminated. It entails a very close examination of how the use of external and internal resources can be most effectively balanced for the Union. It entails allocating staff to areas of major policymaking importance within departments and across the Commission. And, when this allocation has been completed, we will be able to determine whether the resources at our disposal are equal to the tasks entrusted to us. If it is proven that they are not, we will raise the issue of increased resources with the Budgetary Authority. If we do not receive a positive response, we will have to address the difficult matter of deciding which of our lower-priority activities should be suspended. This should not be done only by the Commission, but also by this Parliament and the Council. I am not making this observation because the Prodi Commission has the slightest desire to renounce activities or tasks. On the contrary, as many Members of this House understand, I am putting forward these considerations because we want to fulfill our tasks in the most effective and responsible manner. That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources by reducing activities or increasing resources, or by a combination of both. In each of the three pillars of reform, the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely decisive. The new activity-based management system, which the President just mentioned, will for the first time link political priorities with the availability of resources and, consequently, with the budget. Thus, the role of the Budgetary Authority in the functioning of activity-based management will be decisive. It is clear that attempts to manage the Commission's activities on a small scale would not benefit anyone. A solid and practical interinstitutional agreement will therefore be a prerequisite for the efficient functioning of activity-based management. In human resources policy, Parliament's involvement will inevitably have to be that of an employer of civil servants and a democratic institution to which the Commission must be accountable. This will also be a very difficult imperative. And finally, in the crucial area of financial management, where the Court of Auditors, the Committee of Independent Experts, and other external and internal analyses have strongly recommended real changes, the support of this House for the implementation of the recommendations to make the most of the money without compromising security will be of paramount importance. In the limited time available to me for this statement, it is obviously impossible to set out our proposals in greater detail.	es
This is a great danger and we must ensure that all regions in Europe can participate in the knowledge society and that no one is excluded. Europe must be able to draw on the realities of its regions more than in the past in order to make the most of the strength of these regions for creativity and to arrive at a more realistic employment policy. We have had to note that despite all the resources allocated under the Structural Funds, there are still major differences in unemployment rates. I therefore call for networks to be established between the regions and for the idea of a Europe in which each Member State thinks for itself to be abandoned. Mr President, Mr Guterres, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome and approve of the fact that the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency have proclaimed full employment as the objective of European policy. I agree, but a sustainable model of full employment primarily includes skilled jobs with social protection. We need to change the world of the economy and work so that paid work becomes environmentally sustainable. They are primarily focusing on further reforms to deregulate the economy in the internal market, on the Internet revolution, on electronic trade and transactions as job-creating machines. With these policies they will not be able to deliver on the promise of full employment. Economic reforms such as the liberalisation of the internal energy market have led to fierce competition and numerous mergers, resulting in job losses, and this trend is still ongoing. Commissioner Bangemann promised enormous job growth through the information society back in the mid-1990s. The result we are facing is disappointing. Growth in sectors such as the media, mobile telephony and software has not been able to compensate for job losses in the telecommunications and electronics industries, nor for the effects of information technology-induced rationalisation in other sectors of the economy. And it does not increase my optimism to see many e-commerce companies registering a gigantic capitalization on the stock market, while at the operational level they continue to operate at a loss. It is clear that e-commerce and electronic transactions in general have a great future; but their contribution to employment growth is exaggerated by their protagonists in almost mystical terms. That is why I am convinced that for a new policy of full employment we need a different policy mix. Firstly, we need a less rigid monetary policy, a budgetary policy that strengthens investments for enlargement and the future, a wage policy linked to productivity that stimulates European internal demand and employment growth. Secondly, we need a strategy of drastically reducing working hours and redistributing work between women and men. Thirdly, we need to strengthen employment incentivized by public means in environmentally friendly economic sectors and a parallel innovation policy that looks to the future and aims in particular to consolidate small and medium-sized enterprises. Fourth, we need a policy of emancipation of the labor market, which clearly rejects strategies aimed at creating categories of underpaid work and compulsory work schemes for unskilled jobs, because only with a broad-based training offensive can we create a sufficient basis for a skilled workforce for the knowledge society, for environmentally friendly social and cultural services.	it
I also think it is right to recognise the efforts that High Representative Solana is making to have a more effective, more visible and more coherent common foreign and security policy with the European Union. In this sense, I agree with the interventions made by some colleagues who preceded me according to which it is necessary to have a global policy that integrates not only military aspects, but also civil, diplomatic, humanitarian and police elements, to which High Representative Solana referred. The Portuguese Presidency has made significant progress, in fact, by creating a series of bodies of a provisional or interim nature. In record time, it organised this informal Council of defence ministers and indicated a whole series of objectives to be achieved during the long journey towards this common foreign and security policy. One of these was the Sintra Council about which I have some questions to ask High Representative Solana. This Council was based on two documents: a British document on the headline goals, dedicated to priority objectives, and another document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union. Mr Solana, I would like to ask you whether, at the next Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, you would be prepared to explain in detail to the members of that Committee B, together with Commissioner Patten, to whom I ask the same question, and with the President-in-Office of the Council, to whom I ask you, Mr Solana, to forward this request, the content of the documents that were discussed at the Summit. A second question, Mr Solana, would be to know to what extent you support the observations and statements made by the French Minister for Defence, according to whom it was necessary for the Member States to allocate 0.7% of their gross domestic product to defence spending. I would like to know your opinion, whether you share this view, whether you really believe that a more decisive contribution from the Member States in this area is necessary. Thirdly, what is your assessment of the recently concluded Crisex 2000@ exercises, in which, for the first time, the European Union shared a series of initiatives with NATO? Fourthly and finally, Mr Solana, I would like to know whether, if the Member States were to ask you, you would be prepared to chair the Political and Defence Committee, adding this post to all the experience you currently have as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, as Secretary-General of the Western European Union and as a former Secretary-General of NATO. Mr High Representative, as rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs on security and defence issues, I will limit my speech to that area. Mr High Representative, you have heard the strong criticisms made by Members who cannot accept the terrible situation in Kosovo, in Chechnya and in other parts of the world. For my part, I do not mean to exasperate her and today, as far as she is concerned, I recognize the efforts she has made to build a European security and defense policy worthy of the name that did not exist before. It is true that we are still far from the desired objective, or at least from the objective that I hope for.	it
"We too are affected by this democratic deficit. And that is why, the day after the inauguration of the Intergovernmental Conference, during which I will have the honour of representing the Commission alongside President Prodi and working, I repeat, in full agreement with your two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, we have just decided within the College to launch the ""Dialogue for Europe and on Europe"", to contribute to this direct contact with citizens. All the Commissioners, whenever they have to go to a country and not just their country of origin, to a region - it happens to me three or four times a month - have committed to dedicating some of their time to a direct dialogue with citizens, not just with the elites or institutional leaders who meet regularly, to establish direct contact, in a university, a high school, a factory, to meet people, answer questions and listen. This will be the role that we will assume, as you will assume yours, with respect to this indispensable initiative, with respect to this pressing obligation aimed at reducing the democratic deficit, that is, the distance between what we do and the citizens. We wish to pursue this initiative in collaboration with the Member States and in liaison with the European Parliament. We will regularly present a summary, so as to take the pulse of public opinion and consequently make adjustments or impose new orientations. We also wish to pursue this initiative in consultation with national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organisations, socio-professional circles and the media. Opinion centres, political groups and parties, European and national parliamentarians, elected representatives, as I have just said, of local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, civil society organisations and university circles will be involved. I would also like to point out - if there was any need - that on 1 February the European Parliament itself had already taken the initiative, for which I once again thank President Napolitano, to organise an initial working meeting with representatives of national parliaments, i.e. representatives of the citizens of each State. The Commission will propose to the Member States to join in this operation either in the context of specific cooperation or in the context of a more structured partnership. We will activate a plan for the media and close contacts with the Presidency of the Union and the European Parliament. I have already explained the ways in which the Commissioners will contribute during meetings and on-site visits. In practice, we want to organise civic debates. Allow me simply, without wishing to give lessons or advice, to point out that when I had the honour of being Minister for European Affairs in my country, I perceived this need to dialogue directly with citizens. By directly carrying out this dialogue every week in each region, I realised that there was an incredible need to give a face to the European Union. So, every week, I went to talk to them together with a Commissioner, not necessarily a French Commissioner, or ambassadors based in Paris or European parliamentarians."	it
"Having made these general remarks, I would like to focus my remarks on Interreg on your main points. The first are related to the timetable and content of this initiative. You say that the adoption of these guidelines was too late, and the risk of interrupting previous programmes has been highlighted, particularly by your rapporteur. This is true, I acknowledge it, and you know the reasons for this, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the European Parliament. There was a delay in adopting the Interreg guidelines in March-April 2000. I acknowledge this, and I take note of it as you do. I note, however, that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the Interreg III programmes, and the draft guidelines were distributed more than three months ago. I also note that the eligibility of expenditure will be accepted from the date of presentation of the programmes, and I confirm the possibility of retroactivity to 1 January, if this programme is presented before 30 April. That's the first point. Second point: regarding the non-exhaustive list of measures eligible for strand B, I want to tell you and confirm that I have asked the Commission to agree to include other specific themes, particularly in support of small and medium-sized enterprises or cultural heritage, in the list of actions eligible for strand B and therefore to no longer consider this list as exhaustive. Third point: interregional cooperation, the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by your Assembly on the importance of this strand C, of interregional cooperation. As your rapporteur requests, I will send you detailed information on the system for implementing this strand. Fourth point: the observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office. As you requested, I have decided to delete all reference to the use of a technical assistance office in the text, pending the outcome of the debate currently under way within the Commission on systems for outsourcing services. But, ladies and gentlemen, if we remove any reference and, later, any recourse to a BAT, this has a consequence, which must be the increase in certain civil service posts to do this work, because someone will have to do it and I will not be able to redeploy the same staff indefinitely, even though our tasks are increasing with ISPA and with the concern to better control, rigorously and transparently, the Community credits for which I am responsible, often in partnership or joint responsibility with the Member States. Now, regarding the implementation of Interreg, a subject that has been raised by many of you, and the possible eligibility for strand A, ""Cross-border cooperation"", of actions in the Adriatic, for Sicily or for the outermost regions, the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, understands your concerns and hears your request on these various points. I therefore intend to amend the guidelines to include a specific priority in transnational strand B: ""Integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions"", so as to cover, in what I consider to be an appropriate manner, the various possibilities for cooperation between these regions."	fr
For now, it's clear that the first priority is rescue helicopters, and then food aid and other emergency assistance must follow. Three weeks after these floods began, the entire world has finally begun to wake up and realize the horrifying situation in Mozambique: thousands of people whose lives hang in the balance, and if we don't deploy means of transport, especially air transport, to get them out of this situation, they will quickly die. That is undoubtedly the most pressing issue right now: rescue transport and emergency humanitarian aid, including food aid. But I would like to emphasize that the European Union and the rest of the world cannot limit their aid to Mozambique to this emergency issue we are talking about. We must be aware of the devastation caused by the floods. Therefore, it is urgent to begin thinking now about finding financial support for the reconstruction of the infrastructure that has been destroyed, without which Mozambique would be unable to continue its path toward development, which it began so promisingly a few years ago. This issue of infrastructure reconstruction is fundamental; without it, there is no development, and it is also time for some of Mozambique's creditor countries to consider forgiving or reducing their debts. If nothing is done now, we will undo all the efforts made in the past to help Mozambique develop. Therefore, I hope that the visit to Mozambique made this week by Commissioner Nielson and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union will allow this extremely important issue to be properly raised. Mr. President, it has already been said that Mozambique, after a war that plunged the country into poverty, now finds itself facing a natural disaster of terrifying proportions. While it is not yet possible to calculate how many people have died, it is known that some 80,000 are in imminent danger of drowning and that 300,000 have lost their homes and fields. They urgently need aid for survival, food, water, and shelter. Then comes the need for medicines to prevent the epidemics, which appear to have already begun, and for the means for reconstruction. But immediate aid is difficult to reach, despite the efforts of NGOs, as roads, bridges, and railway lines are closed. Helicopters are needed. There are only five, it seems, to bring 80,000 people down from the trees. But the machinery used to mobilize aid is too heavy. The Socialist Group in this Parliament has promoted the prevention of natural disasters—it has even defended conflict prevention—as the best way to avoid situations like the one now suffered by the people of Mozambique. I would particularly like to recall the efforts of Member Michel Rocard, from the previous term. The European Commission responded by launching, as early as 1994, a disaster prevention program—DIPECHO—that sought to be proactive and, from a regional perspective, to prevent disasters or, at least, minimize their effects on populations.	es
The European Union's policy must regain the trust of citizens, who demand the right to access the institutions quickly and without preclusions and who demand that the rules on which their understanding depends be legible. They want a policy destined to succeed, which they see as a normal service rendered to responsible citizens. The success of the reform depends essentially on the initiative of the Commission. However, I am irritated by the statement made today by the Commission, according to which the discussion of the interim report with Parliament must be of an informal nature only. Commissioner Kinnock, your intervention next Tuesday in the Committee on Budgetary Control cannot, however, be one-sided, because Parliament wants and must contribute to the reforms. This week's press conference also offends my political sensibilities because it is held before a thorough discussion of the proposal in the Committee on Budgetary Control. Commissioner Kinnock, despite your personal successes, it seems to me that the Commission still has a long way to go before it can meet our strong but legitimate expectations. I would like to begin by putting on record and making it clear to Mrs Langenhagen that the decision that I will not be speaking at tomorrow's plenary session and therefore not be available to give formal answers on the report is not mine or the Commission's, but a decision of Parliament. So if she wants to lecture, she should do so here in the Chamber. She knows me well enough to know that at all stages of these five years, in which we have worked together in Parliament, there has not been a single occasion on which I have refused to give a full, formal and detailed account of my actions. Mr President, I would like to begin by paying tribute to the conscientious and, from what I understand, generous work of Mr Van Hulten in preparing this report. Although new to this Chamber, he is quite senior in some respects, certainly in terms of his familiarity with the institutions given that he is a former civil servant; I believe that he has demonstrated this quality in skilfully tackling a complex subject which is of the utmost importance to all our institutions, as several Members have pointed out. I thank him and wish him a long and successful career as a Member. Mr President, as you will know, Mr Van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, as I intend to respond in detail in particular on the issues of financial management and control, I ask you to be indulgent. I will of course not take up more of the House's time than is absolutely necessary. When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts last September, I promised on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be considered as a key element in the Commission's reform proposals. Our efforts to keep that promise will be evident to Parliament when we consider the package of reforms that the Commission has adopted today, well within the deadline we set ourselves four months ago.	it
Negotiations in Austria for the formation of the government The next item is the debate on the negotiations in Austria for the formation of the government. I now give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to send three messages to European public opinion today. Let me be clear: we are profoundly united on these three messages. First, we wish to make it clear that we fully support and identify with the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the 14 Member States, because we believe it reflects the community of values that has been built by all of us, and not by a single political force. In any case, this is a community of values that is contrary to those defended by this party, which has ironically called itself the Party of Freedom. The Europe we are currently building is precisely the result of bitter experiences that we have all endured, and the Socialist Group condemns the insults addressed to the President of the French Republic and the Belgian government, but also to the Socialists, who are also European citizens, because, ladies and gentlemen, the Austrian Socialists are now accused of treason against their homeland. I will tell you one thing: for many years, I betrayed my homeland, at least that is what General Franco said. President Guterres also betrayed Salazar. I believe it is necessary for the EPP to affirm and defend this. Furthermore, I believe that the Commission, Mr President Prodi, has been the guardian of the Treaties. But I remind President Prodi that during the investiture debate, he spoke of the Commission as a European government. A government must have more nerve and courage. This is what I am asking of President Prodi for the time being. (Applause) With all due respect to a Commissioner as efficient as Mr. Fischler, according to certain rumors—it all depends on the language in which they are expressed—President Prodi has asked for Mr. Fischler's resignation. I would be grateful if you would clarify this point before Parliament. Secondly, Madam President, we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people. An appeal to the majority of the Austrian people who did not vote for Haider, who voted for clearly democratic parties, committed to the European project. I would like to point out that while Mr. Schüssel was Minister of Finance, Chancellor Vranitzky also played a role in Austria's integration process. In politics, one cannot be so partisan. It was together that we made Austria's entry into the Community possible. This is the work of all of us, not just one group. Therefore, Madam President, we believe it is our right and our duty to ask the Austrians to rethink their choice, as this type of plague, which we have already suffered in Europe, risks harming Austria, but also spreading, as history reminds us.	fr
It is not enough to make proposals based on approximate data. What we need is a legally binding objective for OSPAR. Only in this way will we achieve legal clarity and, above all, the possibility of legal action. Anything else would be ineffective and would not help prevent ecological disasters like the one we are currently experiencing in Romania and Hungary from occurring here. I find it regrettable that national governments are not willing to commit to legally binding protection, despite having agreed on OSPAR at international level. But I believe that this is precisely what we must rectify here in Parliament, in order to show that we will not tolerate any damage to the credibility of our policy. It is also important to strengthen the polluter-pays principle, because prices must tell the ecological truth. We cannot bow to the interests of the agricultural and chemical industry lobbies; Rather, we must proclaim and express through our vote that we want the polluter pays principle and, in doing so, prices that cover costs. Water is our most important vital resource, and we must ensure, with our vote, that we encourage and push for genuine compliance with the OSPAR Convention. This is possible with closed production cycles; anything else would be a watering down of the directive. Let us seize this opportunity! Mr President, in the short time I have, I would like to welcome the report and recall three principles, to which must be added all the rest, which are clearly set out in the rapporteur's amendments: water is not a commodity but a heritage belonging to the peoples of the Union; the ultimate objective is to achieve the elimination of all pollutants from surface and groundwater; and the population must be informed so that they can participate in the recovery of water and do not consume it excessively when it is such a precious commodity. I know that this directive may encounter problems because we have discussed here the different realities of the different countries of the Union. What happens in the north is different from what happens in the south and from what happens in countries that have desertification problems. I know that. But some amendments attempt to help the southern countries, specifically Amendment 43, which, when it talks about cost recovery, also indicates that Member States will have to take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when making decisions. There are also difficulties in the area of transfers. In my country—I live in the north of Spain—there is a big difference between the north and the south, and these difficulties arise when it comes to transferring water from one place to another. But Mrs. Lienemann's report also says that the receiving river basins must save and look after their water.	fr
This public intervention is feasible and the decentralisation of university education would certainly help to balance development policy. Another point we would like to highlight is linked to industrial policy. In planning the coordination of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds, the Commission should have taken greater account of the importance of the tertiary sector, e-commerce and the spread of Internet use. In the past, poverty and wealth depended above all on the structure of the local economic fabric. Regions with a greater industrial presence were, in fact, considered rich. Today the situation is completely different, in fact we have reached the opposite, and these regions have become impoverished. It is therefore important to invest in new sectors, in so-called electronic production and in the tertiary sector, which represent the future. This, in my opinion, has been almost ignored by the competent committee that prepared this report. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy therefore calls on the Commission to devote greater attention to this issue. Finally, as the Committee on Energy, we would have liked to see more financial support for renewable energy sources through the use of the Structural Funds and the Regional Development Funds. This would have promoted greater use of renewable energy sources, compensating for the insufficient funding in the Energy Development Programme. . (EN) Mr President, my warmest thanks to Mrs Schroedter for her work. I would like to explain to my colleagues that I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Flautre, who followed this practice in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but that unfortunately it is not good. I would like to draw your attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2, which were adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but not in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and financial support for local initiatives aimed at creating jobs and strengthening social cohesion. In the past, this Parliament has recognised the huge job-creating potential of the social economy. The above amendments therefore fit with Parliament's position that social exclusion is a serious problem that requires constructive action. We hope that those who are considering voting against these amendments have very good reasons to present to Parliament and to job-seekers. In her report, Mrs Flautre also highlights an area where there is a painful lack of coordination that is desperately needed. The Commission's proposals relate to the four pillars of the employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund. The lack of specific guidelines here is particularly acute, given that the idea of linking Social Fund aid to the employment strategy will be implemented for the first time during the 2000-2006 programming period. This omission gives the impression that the Commission itself has no idea how to ensure maximum coordination between support from the European Social Fund, subject to review after three and a half years, and the annual national employment action plans of the Member States.	it
"This event reinforces the need to strengthen European civil protection, following the guidelines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested today by one or two Members. But, for now, the priority is to overcome the crisis. As I have already said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, is on the scene today. She will report to Parliament in detail on the actions she will propose as a result of her visit. This has been a horrific tragedy for Europe, and Europe must respond and do everything it can to ensure that such terrible events do not continue to blight our future. The debate is closed. The vote will follow. VOTES. (FR) The only reason we voted in favor of the PSE-Verts/ALE-GUE/NGL compromise resolution is that only this resolution allowed us to ""condemn the decision of the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its factory in Italy."" However, the measures proposed in this resolution are insignificant in halting the policies of large industrial groups, which are eliminating jobs and exacerbating unemployment. On the other hand, these are mere words, since socialist governments, which are the majority in Europe, are as incapable as right-wing governments of taking the necessary measures to prevent layoffs. The real problem is not finding legal procedures that make dismissal procedures more complex, but rather prohibiting layoffs. The only way to stop this infernal mechanism—which, on the one hand, generates financial surplus value and, on the other, unemployment—is to prohibit layoffs in all large, profit-making companies, under penalty of expropriation, and to publish the balance sheets of these large companies and subject them to scrutiny by their workers and the entire population. Society must have the means to impose its own priorities on large companies and their owners, and first and foremost, the eradication of unemployment. The sums necessary to create useful jobs in public services, as well as to finance the sharing of work among all, without lowering wages, must be obtained from the profits of large companies. This is infinitely more important, for the majority of society, than wasteful financial transactions or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders. (SV) I cannot support this resolution, since Point 8 singles out a specific industry in Italy with the desire to maintain its facilities, while at the same time advising the company's current management to sell the factory to a European tire manufacturer. It is not the task of the European Parliament to declare which factories in the fifteen countries of the European Union must remain or close, increase or decrease their workforce, remain in one place or move, sell or not sell, and which ones must be sold, within or outside Europe."	es
"Madam President, everyone has underlined: today is a very important day, the day of the first debate in the political life of Europe. And that is no coincidence. Today, however, the issue is not the relationship between Europe, our institutions, Austria, or Mr. Haider's party. I think today it is about Europe itself, its raison d'être, the reasons why we are sitting here in this Parliament today. This Parliament does not stand for money and goods. This Parliament and the European institutions stand for values, for a morality, and for a spirit. We have learned from the 20th century that democracies can be endangered, that these morals, these values, and this spirit can be fatally infected by viruses called fanatical nationalism, populism, and racism. One need only read the manifesto of Mr. Haider's party, the FPÖ. Fanatical nationalism, populism, and racism can be found in every chapter. I will just quote one sentence, to which my friend Vidal-Quadras referred earlier: ""The concept of homeland is defined in spatial, ethnic, and cultural terms—in terms of space, culture, and race."" And we cannot accept such declarations. If Europe is to have any meaning, and—forgive me for saying this to my political friends—if Christian democracy has any meaning, if the history of Christian democracy has any meaning, then it must clearly and unequivocally distance itself from the statements of this program and refuse, however many good reasons there may be, to enter into an agreement with an organization of this nature and ideology. That is why I believe that the European Parliament, which is more independent in its statements and actions than the Council or the Commission, must pay tribute to the states and European institutions that had the courage to say no; to say what you, Madam President, have declared on our behalf. A declaration that honors us and clearly and bluntly expresses our rejection and condemnation of what is unfolding in Austria. We should remember what a great French Christian Democrat said on the day of the Munich Agreement: ""When it comes to saying no, it's best to say it immediately."" (Applause) Madam President, we are worried. We, that is the Belgian Christian Democrats, and, happily, many other colleagues as well. The coalition being prepared in one of the Member States is certainly an Austrian matter, but it also undeniably has a European dimension. After all, what unites us in Europe are, first and foremost, the values and principles of freedom, democracy, and respect for human rights. The leader of the Freedom Party of Austria, Jörg Haider, has repeatedly expressed his disregard for these values. He also disregards elementary forms of diplomatic courtesy. He is a dangerous man. The Christian Democratic parties in my country made their decision long ago, and they're sticking to it: They acknowledge the protests of far-right voters, but they never negotiate with far-right leaders. Values must take precedence over power."	de
Mr. President, it is true that the suspension or indefinite postponement of talks between Syrians and Israelis, as well as the new bomb attack the day before yesterday, which injured 16 people, are not good news. It is clear that for once, the United States has not succeeded in breaking the deadlock so that these negotiations can resume. It is true that the obstacles are considerable: the Syrians aspire to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and to recover the borders established prior to June 4, 1967, while the Israelis, believing that this is more appropriate for their situation, want the borders retained to be those established in 1923. The blockage of these talks between Syrians and Israelis is not the only delay in the Middle East peace process. The implementation of the framework agreement between the Palestinian Authority and Israel is currently suspended. Following the conversations that took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the head of the Palestinian Authority, the Israeli Prime Minister requested a two-month postponement from February 13, the deadline for implementing the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. What can the European Union do about this situation? Unfortunately, not much. It should logically support these negotiations, under the auspices of the United States, and should increase contacts. The presence of the European Union envoy, Ambassador Moratinos, who certainly fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency in accordance with the powers available to the European Union, is positive. But all this does not prevent us from realizing that we are relatively powerless, because when the negotiators from both sides fly back to the United States this weekend, we will not be able to help thinking that for every hundred dollars spent on the peace process in the region, 60 dollars are paid by the European Union. And when we think that a Conference will soon be held in Moscow, the pathetic nature of the European Union's presence in this process is highlighted. I would like to emphasize to the Portuguese Presidency the need for us to play a more central role and that it is time to step up and assume a greater European Union presence. I hope that the upcoming visit of the President of the European Parliament to the region, as well as that of the chairs of the corresponding interparliamentary delegations, will mark the beginning of a period in which the European Union will take greater initiative and be more present in this difficult and complex peace process. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I would like to thank you for your contributions, particularly Mr Patten, whose analysis I fully share. Therefore, I do not intend to repeat what he said. I would simply like to make three points which Commissioner Patten will no doubt consider to be similar to what he said, but which, for various reasons, can only be formulated so openly by a parliamentarian.	fr
I cannot but fully share this wish. As soon as this opinion is approved here in Parliament, it will be resubmitted to the STAR Committee so that Member States can confirm their approval, which was provisionally issued on 14 November. I assume the Commission will be able to approve the final version of the guidelines in March/April. Once they are published in the Official Journal, there will only be a few months—specifically, six months—to submit LEADER+ programs. I think it's important to mention one thing: Expenditure incurred within the framework of LEADER+ is eligible from the moment the program is in the hands of the Commission. For programs submitted before 30 April of this year, there is also the possibility of retroactively setting 1 January as the start of eligibility. Finally, the draft resolution contains seven specific amendments to the guidelines under item 20. After careful analysis, I can tell you that the amendments contained in paragraphs 2, 4, 5, and 7 are acceptable to the Commission and will be adopted. The amendment to paragraph 6 is also partially accepted, as it insists that the deadline for authorizing programs under LEADER+ be a maximum of six months. The amendment to paragraph 1 is no longer relevant, in our view, because, as a result of discussions with the Member State representatives in the STAR Committee, this point was reworded in line with Parliament's position. Consequently, only the amendment to paragraph 3 remains. The Commission cannot but endorse this request for amendment, as it reflects exactly what the Commission itself originally formulated. However, I must add that, for the Member States, the cooperation of our action groups with similar groups in third countries has gone too far. Consequently, an amendment has been made in committee, but the Commission will now comply with Parliament's wishes in the revised version and thus present the guidelines. It will also continue to fight to make this acceptable to the Member States. I would like to briefly refer to the 13 amendments that have been tabled. Here, the Commission cannot accept three, specifically Amendments 3, 12, and 13. It can accept all the others in their entirety or in their meaning. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an exceptional opportunity to speak today, in this legislative term, about the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament. Recently, due to the political changes in Austria, there has been growing political unrest in Europe; there are political declarations and political dialogue. It is fair to point out that both Parliament and the Commission can put forward certain policies. Certain proposals not only on legislation but also on action plans related to the fight against discrimination, to building free and fair communities. I will therefore make a brief mention of discrimination and take this opportunity to request that the relevant committees responsible appoint their rapporteurs to advance this anti-discrimination package as quickly as possible.	es
We must also continue our support for economic reform and social development throughout Lebanon. A solution must be found to the problem of the Palestinian refugees; with almost five million people, they are the largest refugee population in the world, and this demonstrates the enormous challenges that will have to be met in the future. We must support initiatives to increase the availability of the region's extremely scarce water resources and improve their distribution and management. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we must promote closer regional cooperation in various fields and try to bring all the countries concerned together to work together to solve their common problems. It is already clear that the Community's current financial resources for supporting this region will not be sufficient to meet the enormous needs that will arise after a lasting peace agreement. I wish to emphasize this emphatically. I would like to urge the Council, and if necessary Parliament, that we must not promise more than we can ultimately deliver. I repeat that a change in Middle East policy will require a fundamentally new approach to the support we have requested and expected. I hope I can assume that we will want to provide this support. As Mr Gama said at the beginning, progress has been made in recent months and weeks. Nevertheless, this difficult process will inevitably be accompanied by problems and disappointments. We will do everything we can to ensure that this process is brought to a successful conclusion and that we can meet the tasks and challenges that this agreement will entail. In conclusion, for those who have only arrived in the Chamber in the last few minutes, I would like to repeat what I said at the beginning: unfortunately, I cannot stay until the end of the debate because this debate was originally scheduled to take place in the morning, and I have therefore arranged a time for this evening to discuss the situation in the Balkans. I hope Members of the House will understand. Mr President, Commissioner Patten can count on our understanding. I would like to say to him that connections with Madrid have normally improved, and I therefore hope to see him there soon. The statements we have heard today on the Middle East peace process come at a very opportune time, given the pressed trip to the territory made by Minister Gama – I also regret his absence from this debate – accompanied by other Council representatives. The tone of the media reports on recent events in the territory might lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation. I honestly believe that such an assessment would not do justice to the facts. In this respect, I share Commissioner Patten's positive perspective. My point is this: it is true that the Israeli Government has postponed the third handover of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authorities. But it is also true that since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements, 39% of the territory of the West Bank and two-thirds of the Gaza Strip have been transferred to the Palestinian Authority, and, most importantly, this agreement has been meticulously implemented to date, especially since even its postponement is a prerogative of the Government of Israel, as provided for in Sharm el-Sheikh.	de
And we must also understand that at the European Union level, there will be contradictions between the various common policies, in this case, development. We must understand that these contradictions exist and we must reduce them to a minimum, a just and wise objective, which is the purpose of presenting this resolution. I believe that the idea of creating an observatory on the evolution of this coherence between Community policies and cooperation and development policies, whose scope of action should not be limited to Community policies but should also encompass the actions or policies of Member States, including the actions of economic groups, which I believe is important, is quite wise and pertinent. This observatory should prepare an annual report on the evolution and impact of these policies and their combination. I have left for last an issue that seems fundamental to me and that this Parliament should—it seems to me—take into account and approve. This new objective of minimizing contradictions between cooperation and development policy and other policies must be a valid goal not only within the European Union, but also globally, given the increasing globalization of the economy. If we want fair world trade, we must impose this same principle at the level of the next round of multilateral negotiations in the World Trade Organization, because it would be contradictory for the European Union to impose an iron, albeit fair, discipline on itself, only for the United States and other major powers to then come and do the opposite and take advantage of what we fail to do. Therefore, it is fair and fundamental that these principles be established in the next round of negotiations at the World Trade Organization. Mr. President, I would like to limit myself to the relationship between development cooperation and agriculture. A considerable portion of the funds have been allocated in recent years to the development of agriculture and livestock in developing countries, and especially in the Lomé countries. The results have not been what we expected. What could be the reason? I believe the root cause must be sought, first of all, in the lack of a clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries, with the corresponding exceptions. I believe the Commission must play an important role in developing that policy. No farmer, anywhere, will produce anything if prices are too low. The governments of developing countries always face a difficult choice: whom should we support, the farmers or the people in the big cities who want cheap food? This delicate balance must be achieved with the support of the Commission, and not only by this institution; the Member States themselves also provide aid in most of the countries where the Commission is active. Member States' policies cannot be allowed to contradict those of the Commission. The Commission's delegations in developing countries must play a leading role in conducting political dialogue and must ensure that all countries follow the same path.	es
Let us consider the fact that the Commission wants to dismantle or proposes to dismantle, considering itself not up to the task, for example the powers, which are conferred upon it by the Treaty, of implementing common policies. What do we ask in any way of a government? What do we ask of this, so to speak, ambiguous and particular structure that is the European Community? It is good that common resources have a supranational government and that they are not delegated to the Member States or to the BATs, as has happened in the past. It seems to me that you are proposing the same menu to us, but you are proposing it in an aggravated manner, limiting yourself, you say, to the tasks of designing a few White Papers, as you have proposed. The fear I have - even if you shake your head, Mr President - is that this will translate into what some countries have been thinking for years, that is, that the Commission should be a good secretariat of the Council of Ministers. If this is the role that the Commission intends to take on in the next five years, we, convinced federalists, are certain that this is not the right path to take and we will call it on this basis and judge what the Commission intends to do. The reform is important but, if it leads to a weakening, a reduction and a diminution of the supranational powers of the Commission, the structure of European integration is at stake, what the founding fathers had envisaged for the European Commission. As for the other points, Mr President, I take economic and social policy as an example: of course the European social model is in deep crisis, of course the problem of unemployment, not by chance, is the number one problem that none of our policies has managed to resolve, but it is not certain that it can be resolved by making a list of the problems we have spoken about in the past, without having a clear vision, a proposal, that there are economies in our Europe that are moving at some of the fastest paces and that, not by chance, are the economies that have been able to make the flexibility of the labour market and of business the number one objective. If we continue to get bogged down in proposals that have borne very little fruit up to now, I do not know what we will be able to do and what the Commission will be able to do. The same applies to enlargement as an end in itself, without it being linked to a much more effective reform of the European Union and its structures, to proposals that the Commission could also have made at the IGC. Mr President, I want to say one positive thing to you, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some colleagues, regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government. Your position has convinced us: you did well not to isolate that country further. In any case, we will see, in practice, what the concrete actions will be. I repeat, Mr President: it is a vision that is, in our opinion, a little short-sighted. Above all, there is a lack of impetus in the sectors that I have mentioned, for example with regard to the Balkans.	it
I must add, however, that the cooperation of our working groups with similar groups in third countries has gone too far in the eyes of the Member States. We have therefore reached an amendment in committee. The Commission will nevertheless once again take Parliament's expectations into account in the revised version and submit the amended guidelines. It will thus continue to strive to ensure that this objective becomes acceptable to the Member States. One last piece of information regarding the 13 amendments tabled. Of these 13 amendments, only three cannot be accepted by the Commission, namely Amendments 3, 12, and 13. All the others can be accepted, either completely or in spirit. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an extraordinary coincidence that the EQUAL initiative is being discussed in the European Parliament during this period. Recently, and due to political developments in Austria, there has been growing political concern in Europe, but also political statements and dialogue. It must be emphasized that concrete policies must be presented to both Parliament and the Commission. Concrete proposals for both legislation and action plans that concern the fight against discrimination and the establishment of social rights and freedoms. Therefore, allow me to briefly refer to the package of measures against discrimination, by asking the responsible committees of Parliament to appoint rapporteurs in order to address the package of measures against discrimination as quickly as possible. I now come to the EQUAL initiative, which is of course based on Article 13. The EQUAL initiative concerns all forms of discrimination on the basis of Article 13, that is, the fight against discrimination based on sex, race, age, and disability. I would like, in particular, to congratulate Mrs Stenzel because her attempts to conclude the agreement on the EQUAL initiative are particularly difficult and complex, not only because the committees involved defended completely different points of view, but also because it was an extremely sensitive political issue. The first observation, which was also made by many other colleagues, refers to the question of whether there should be a separate mention for women. It is true that we have expressed our disagreement with one aspect of Article 13, but the Treaty at this moment is as it stands, and among the categories of discrimination we find discrimination on the basis of sex. Thus, in accordance with the Treaty as it stands today, the EQUAL initiative is structured in this way. I would like to point out, however, that there is a special focus in the employment strategy concerning women and that a special programme is being prepared, the fifth programme for equality between men and women. I have divided the issues that have attracted the attention of colleagues into four groups. Firstly, the broadening of thematic areas. There are four thematic areas, such as the employment strategy, employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree on the broadening of these thematic areas in accordance with the proposals tabled by the European Parliament. As for the concern about the possible danger of allocating all the funds for one of the categories suffering discrimination to a single country, I would say that the initiative stipulates, with the greatest possible clarity, that Member States will have to submit a thematic area for all the categories suffering discrimination.	fr
Austria is a country open to the world where xenophobia and discrimination have no place. What is happening in Austria is a completely normal process of change of power following democratic elections, through which confidence in an old system has been withdrawn and a stable parliamentary majority has been sought and found to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms. There will be a functioning majority, as well as a functioning opposition. The European People's Party, which I represent in this Parliament, has been and is a party that has always consistently advocated for my country's integration into the EU and that feels deeply attached to the community of values of the European Union, as well as to its basic political lines regarding its deepening and enlargement. We respect and accept the debate and also understand the concern expressed in many of our member countries about future developments in Austria. We understand because we know that, due to our very recent history, we also bear a special political responsibility in the present. Our country was not only the first victim of Hitler's dictatorship, but many were also involved, although I reject any collective guilt. Austria found its way to the European Union not least thanks to the ÖVP. My country's place is not outside the European Union but within it... ...and with all the rights and obligations. A future government must be judged by the values and principles it defends in its government program and not by the prejudices held, in part, by political opponents and, in part, by the international media. The recognition of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, a sincere review of Austria's role in the past, and a sharing of information about the greatest crime against humanity in the 20th century, the Holocaust, will also be reflected in the agreement in principle of a future coalition government between the ÖVP and the FPÖ. My party will guarantee that my country remains on the path of European policy and on the basis of the community of European values. (Applause) Madam President, Mr. President of the Council, representatives of the Commission: This is a dark day for Austria and for Europe. Mr. Sichrovsky's web of lies and Mrs. Stenzel's placating words can't change this fact. It's gotten to the point where two irresponsible politicians, consumed by a thirst for power, are selling out Austria's image, political role, and, in part, its economic interests. (Applause, exclamations) They're trading this for the position of head of government and participation in a government. They're accepting that Austria, once a respected country, will become a despised one, as well as the isolation of the country itself and, consequently, of some of its citizens.	es
We need considerably more openness and transparency on this issue than before. It is unacceptable that a measure like this is being imposed on the Member States without proper public debate. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Radical Members, I abstained from voting on this report in the Committee on Budgetary Control because I share the concerns so emphatically expressed by the representative of another, undoubtedly important legal culture, namely common law. We are undoubtedly exerting pressure with this report, as we believe certain aspects require resolution and fraud in the Community must be combated and curbed. However, the way in which our committee intends to conclude this report, under the impetuous pressure and dogged determination of Committee Chair Mrs Theato, cannot be accepted without criticism. Another important criticism of the report concerns secondary legislation. Article 280 of the Treaty empowers the Council to adopt appropriate measures to combat fraud. We are, however, somewhat dismayed that an institution which would represent a qualitative leap has been proposed without immediately anticipating the consequences which this would entail, that is to say, that the aspect of defence and, with it, the possibility of effective functioning of the prosecution and defence in such an important legal system have been neglected. My abstention in committee was intended to express this dismay. Mr President, I believe that this issue must be given serious thought in the European Parliament, both in plenary and in committee, although it cannot, of course, be discussed without taking into account the legal culture and the circles in which institutional issues are discussed. These are very serious incidents which seemed to be commonplace in the past. Certain changes have since taken place, at least in the mechanisms, particularly as regards control. But we are still not satisfied, especially when the relevant bodies are even talking about a European Prosecutor's Office for crimes committed at European level, fraud, embezzlement, and the disclosure of official secrets. We should undoubtedly protect the Community's interests and reputation, as well as its relationship with taxpayers, who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life. For this reason, it is right to raise the problem of general and universal protection of interests, better coordinated with the national justice systems. This raises the most difficult question: what role does a European Prosecutor's Office have in relations with the individual national communities and their respective judicial systems? I believe that this issue still requires further consideration from both a cultural and practical perspective. There is a danger today that a new body will overwhelm the multitude of different institutions existing in each country. Mr President, I would very much like to say two things very quickly. First, I don't want to refer to the philosophical questions of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of the member states, although I am very much in favor of having such a debate, because my regular viewing of British television channels reveals to me the threats to the domestic legal culture posed by national politicians from the continent. Sometimes this is almost worthy of cabaret and deserves a discussion. But that's not my point.	de
"Already weak economies are being further weakened by the AIDS virus. Already overstretched resources are being further strained. In the countries with the highest AIDS rates, 50% or more of all hospital beds are currently occupied by AIDS patients. On a completely different note, I would like to support Cuba's membership as an ACP country in the new Lomé Convention, which will soon be agreed between the European Union and the countries of Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific. I know this is somewhat controversial, particularly because of the United States government's attitude towards the Castro regime. However, on this occasion, the European Union will call for the inclusion of political criteria in the Lomé Convention. Criteria of good government practice, broadly encompassing refugee issues, corruption, human rights, and democracy, will be part of the final agreement between the European Union and all the African, Caribbean, and Pacific Lomé signatories. The Lomé Convention, on which the entire fabric of relations between the European Union and the 71 states of Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific is based, remains the most effective and ambitious development instrument in the context of North-South relations. After years of ""good and faithful service,"" it remains the most important symbol of the European Union's efforts to improve the lot of the poorest countries and promote their development. This is where the human face of Europe is revealed... John Corrie's report rightly highlights the importance of this unique, targeted instrument, as well as the work of the Joint Assembly that implements it. This is all the more true since the precarious structure of this ambitious framework was at risk. The negotiations on the path of the partnership between the European Union and the ACP countries into the new millennium were a very arduous process. I welcome today the fact that reason and generosity have triumphed over the difficulties, opening up new prospects for this partnership. More than 30 years after the launch of the unique North-South Partnership, it is essential to adapt a tried-and-tested but outdated instrument to meet new challenges. Therefore, the new agreement, to be signed in Fiji on 31 May this year for a period of 20 years, represents more than a mere extension of the agreements governing relations between Europe and the ACP states. It must also signify their overhaul. The new agreement clearly enshrines the political dimension of a partnership that provides the only forum for dialogue and political exchange in North-South relations. As the Joint Assembly increasingly opens itself to elected representatives from the parliaments of the ACP states, this dimension must not only be safeguarded but also promoted. The Joint Assembly thus represents a platform for defending the common interests of European and developing countries. Following the fiasco of the Seattle Conference, our task now is to coordinate our position regarding the further development of global trade rules aimed at combating poverty. The partnership can now be built on a long-term basis. The path to its modernization is clear:"	de
Therefore, I ask you, Madam President, to ask the Commission to make its statement now and then proceed to the vote. (Applause from the PSE Group). Madam President, I want to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has the utmost respect for the decisions of this Parliament, including the decision to establish its agenda. We therefore respect what Parliament may decide in this regard. But I also want to make it very clear that President Prodi committed to Parliament to include a new debate, as Mr. Barón recalled, in addition to the annual debate on the Commission's legislative program, on the main lines of action for the next five-year period, that is, for this legislative term. I would like to say, Madam President, that this debate was distinguished, in the agreement reached in September, from the annual presentation of the Commission's legislative program. And I would like to say, Madam President, that, on the Commission's part, we are prepared and willing to hold that debate whenever appropriate, that we were prepared to hold it this week, as had been agreed in principle, based on the fact that it was presented the day before in a speech to the parliamentary groups. Therefore, Madam President, I would like to reiterate that, for our part, we have debated the action programme for the next five years and that we are prepared, whenever Parliament so decides—this week if that is the decision—to present the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for the year 2000, which was what was fully agreed. I propose that we vote on the request by the Group of the Party of European Socialists to reinstate the Commission's declaration on its strategic objectives. (Parliament rejects the request.) President: On Wednesday's subject, I have another proposal concerning the oral question on the capital tax. The PPE-ED Group requests that this item be withdrawn from the agenda. Will any colleague speak on behalf of the group to justify this request? Madam President, I hear some laughter among the Socialists. I have been told that broad circles within the Socialist Group also welcome the deletion of this item from the agenda, since the vote taken at the Conference of Presidents lacked the vote of the competent working group of our colleagues from the Socialist Group. I do not know whether this information is correct, but we, as the PPE/DE Group, would in any case appreciate the deletion of this item, since Parliament has already addressed this issue numerous times. There are also agreements against such a tax. Therefore, my group requests that this item be deleted. Thank you, Mr. Poettering. Let us now listen to Mr. Wurtz, who will speak against the request. Madam President, first of all, I would like to underline the lack of logic on the part of Mr. Poettering, who has just lectured the Group of European Socialists about reconsidering a decision that was made absolutely clearly at the Conference of Presidents.	es
I can also agree with the part of Amendment 6 which proposes an amendment to Directive 93/53 on the basis of scientific and technical evidence. As I have already said, according to available scientific evidence, ISA does not pose a threat to health. I can therefore agree to Amendment 10, provided that the reference to the highest possible standard is replaced by a reference to safety. As regards the environmental impact, many people will be aware that a number of causes have been blamed for the decline in stocks over the past decades, including pollution, overfishing, climate change, and others. At present, it cannot be ruled out that ISA may also have an impact on wild salmon stocks. Fish have already escaped from aquaculture farms, and the virus has been detected in wild salmon. In this regard, there are a number of unresolved questions which can only be clarified through further scientific research. This is also why great caution must be exercised in the fight against ISA. Infected fish must not be allowed to remain on farms, and I am prepared to examine this matter further to prevent the virus from being released into the environment. To this end, I propose that we amend our original proposal to require Commission approval for rural programs drawn up by the competent authorities. This should avoid excessively lengthy fish removal periods. I also propose that fish showing clinical signs of the disease be removed immediately. Using the existing procedures under Community law for establishing additional control measures, removal programs will be established based on the health status of the fish in order to minimize impacts on the environment. On this basis, I can accept Amendments 7 and 8, with a minor modification to Amendment 8. I also have considerable sympathy for Amendment 9, but I believe it could be better worded to establish a link between environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies. I am unable to support Amendments 12 and 13. I have the feeling that this is intended to eliminate any risk. I believe it will be very difficult to achieve this without shutting down the affected fish farming sector. I look forward to Parliament's views on these amendments, and if you believe this approach is the best solution, I will take note of it carefully. I can accept Amendment 11 in part. Finally, I would like to underline that we remain committed to achieving a high level of health protection in accordance with our Treaty obligations. I believe that measures proportionate to this objective are the right way forward. We remain committed to eradicating the disease. This is an objective that will benefit both the environment and the salmon farming sector. I hope that the European Parliament will recognize our commitment by supporting our proposal. I would be very grateful. Thank you, Commissioner Byrne. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. Protection of juveniles of marine organisms The next item is the report (A5-0035/2000) by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 1626/94 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean and amending for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (COM(1999) 552 - C5-0040/2000 - 1999/0222(CNS)).	de
"It is clear that many in Wales see the Structural Funds programme as a way of addressing some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face. We have seen increasing poverty in Wales, a trend that has been increasing since 1997. We have seen the gap between rich and poor widening. We therefore expect the Structural Funds programme not only to look at industrial restructuring, but also to bring about broader improvements across the whole economic base of Wales. What is very damaging to us, however, is the perception that, in some way, the provision of Structural Funds has been a victory for the Government, when all they do is acknowledge that Wales does face very great difficulties. Therefore, I would like to highlight some points that I think the Commission should put at the forefront. We hope that the Commission will address the points relating to additionality. We regret that, in some ways, the British figures have obscured the Welsh figures. We also hope that the Commission will provide the projects with the appropriate funding. We hope that it will ensure, contrary to the British Government, the involvement of the private sector in the planning phase, as it is certain that the private sector must provide the main impetus for the expenditure of structural funds. Finally, we call on the Commission to ensure that structural funds are spent transparently. In this Parliament, transparency is too often lacking. In this area, the Commission can become a great friend of Wales. Mr President, our committee is addressing these issues from many different angles, and I will begin with the research angle. We consider it very positive that, in his conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our proposal that research infrastructures should be expanded in the cohesion countries by locating vocational schools and universities in such a way that they better serve the populations of the less developed regions and allow those trained to remain in their home regions. This is something that can be achieved by taking measures at the level of public authorities. Such decentralisation of higher education is undoubtedly a useful policy when it comes to ensuring development. The second point to which we wanted to draw attention, precisely from the perspective of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission, when considering the coordination of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, to pay greater attention to the impact of the growth of services, e-commerce and the use of the Internet. In the past, poverty and wealth were more dependent on the structures of economic life. The rich regions were those where there were industrial jobs, whereas today these regions may very well have become a burden and are poor. It is therefore necessary to also invest in new sectors of activity, so-called ""electronic"" production and the production of electronic services, because these are sectors of the future."	fr
The best prevention for the future is the certainty that charterers will have of being heavily fined, civilly, criminally and financially, if they are not extremely vigilant about the safety of the vessels they choose. Secondly, the double-hull requirement for oil tankers allowed to use Community waters must be imposed as quickly as possible and not postponed indefinitely. Thirdly, a strict age limit for vessels allowed to use Community waters must be set quickly. This could be a maximum of fifteen years. In the absence of a sufficiently clear, strict and rigorous Community regulatory framework, Member States that wish to establish one should be authorized to do so to protect their population and territory, in the same way that the United States learned the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by requiring double hulls and banning all vessels over twenty years old from its waters. This is how the United States refused the Erika access to its waters. If the Community had done the same, a huge catastrophe would have been avoided. Let us ensure, Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, that this time we truly learn the lesson, even when the media and parliamentary excitement have subsided. Mr. President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic Bravery, Haven, Amoco Cadiz, Gino, Tanio—these are all names of sinister memory. And now Erika. Whose turn is it? Twenty-one years after the Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth oil spill, the seventh since 1967, proves the irresponsibility of our successive governments. The West Atlantic is once again paying a high price for their inability to react, for their capitulation to multinationals. It is difficult to understand why the French and Europeans allow what the Americans refuse, and why Europe, usually so quick to legislate on environmental matters, has ignored maritime safety. The result is clear. The Erika, a ship flying the Maltese flag, a walking wreck ranked among the most dangerous oil tankers, has polluted our coasts over a distance of more than 400 km, representing a pollution level far more serious than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz. As an elected representative for Loire-Atlantique, I can unfortunately attest to this. These repeated disasters are not natural, they owe nothing to fate. They are the consequence of human recklessness. This is truly an ecological catastrophe. Only those out of touch with the harsh realities on the ground could have doubted it. It is also an economic catastrophe for all those who make their living from the sea and tourism: fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, salt workers, traders, etc. The Erika disaster must be the last in the series. First of all, we must shed full light on this shipwreck. Why not appoint a parliamentary commission of inquiry or involve parliamentarians in the mission announced earlier by the Commission? Then, we must urgently legislate, first, to ensure that the exact characteristics of the goods transported are known. Indeed, according to experts, the Erika's oil was expected to sink to the bottom and never reach the coast.	fr
You said the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier. Is this aspect interpreted in the same way on both sides of the Atlantic? In my opinion, we will have particular problems with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified plants. Will the Americans take the same position on this issue as we do? Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that we have just signed a protocol on biosafety in Montreal. This allows us to reach agreement on the definition of the precautionary principle in an international forum. I consider the signing of this protocol a breakthrough on this issue. I believe it will form the basis for future discussions on the precautionary principle, as we will be able to use it as an example for interpreting this principle. Furthermore, this protocol is also recognized as an important and valuable tool. Mr. President, I have two questions and will try to be very brief. My first question concerns the application of the precautionary principle. If I understand correctly, there has been some confusion about this. Is it the case that a risk assessment, including a cost-benefit analysis, must first be carried out? If that were the case, it would be very worrying, since it was not actually intended to use a cost-benefit analysis as an instrument in deciding whether to apply the precautionary principle. Instead, the precautionary principle should take precedence. My second question concerns the burden of proof. I remember Ms. Wallström's presentation to the committee as the new Commissioner. At the time, she spoke of introducing a reversed burden of proof, meaning that the manufacturer of a product must prove its safety. I am now interested to know whether this also applies to the document now presented by the Commission. Thank you, Ms. Schörling. You have raised two important questions, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to comment on them. No, it does not have to start with a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, it should be based on an assessment of our current state of knowledge and scientific findings, and their evaluation in relation to the risks we see for the environment or human or animal health. However, if a particular measure has been decided upon, then the most cost-effective implementation should be chosen. This should prevent measures from being taken that are completely inappropriate in terms of their effectiveness. So it is not necessary to start with a cost-benefit analysis. The second question concerned the reverse burden of proof. It is quite right that we must apply this in certain cases. A good example of an area where this is necessary is the chemicals strategy. However, that concerns a single policy area, whereas this communication on the precautionary principle can be described as horizontal, meaning it affects all policy areas. For this reason, a reverse burden of proof or its implementation will not be discussed separately in this context; instead, the focus will be on political decision-making and the basis for it. However, it is absolutely true that we must adopt a reversed burden of proof, for example, with chemicals. Mr. President, in my opinion, the precautionary principle would have to be quite radical for it to work; otherwise, one would always get lost in the convoluted labyrinths of interpretation.	de
"Finally, I come to the agreement on South Africa, which the rapporteur also mentioned. I am simply delighted—not to say happy—to be able to announce to you this evening, by way of concluding this timely debate, that the South African President has today accepted the solution unanimously proposed last Monday by the EU Council of Foreign Ministers regarding the outstanding problems with South Africa. The ""grappa war"" is therefore over. Peace has returned, and we can now look forward to cooperation with South Africa based on the common values and dreams that bring us together. This, I believe, is a good conclusion to this very interesting debate, and I reiterate my thanks to the rapporteur and to the House for the cooperation that has been established in the context of relations between third world countries and our work. Thank you, Commissioner. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at noon. Stabilisation and Association Agreement with FYROM The next item is the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission's recommendation for a Council decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121(COS)). Mr President, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, today we are talking about a country which has just overcome very difficult times, a country which is nevertheless on the way up, of its own strength, through its own will and with the support of the international community. If the European Union, the Council and the Commission - I assume that Parliament will support this decision tomorrow - propose for the first time in South-Eastern Europe to conclude a Stabilisation and Association Agreement in the Balkan region - I hope to be able to use this term throughout my speech - this constitutes first and foremost recognition of the work accomplished by FYROM/Macedonia on the economic level, but also on the political level, given the war that has raged in the surrounding area and the ethnic minority that lives there. Because having a minority of 33 to 35% on one's own territory is certainly no small feat considering the neighbouring country. This country and its politicians - who undoubtedly differ from one region to another - have always done remarkable work, and this must be recognised. The Commission is proposing that we conclude an agreement with the Council. I would like to make two or three comments specifically concerning the areas in which there may still be some differences of opinion. In this regard, I would like to highlight the quality of the work carried out by Commissioner Patten and I welcome his interest in FYROM and the region as a whole. Let us first talk about the regional approach. If it is understood correctly, I believe that this regional approach is important and necessary."	fr
"I also emphasized the need for prevention. The involvement of the social partners must also be emphasized. Flexibility is needed, and the administrative burden must be reduced; this is a priority. Flexibility is also needed for countries with small budgets. Although I think that some aspects of the report could be better handled in other ways, I believe overall that this report offers a flexible and sensible approach and that it must be supported. With this EQUAL Community initiative, the Commission wants to replace the Employment and ADAPT Community initiatives, as well as various sub-programmes in this sector – NOW (new opportunities for women), Horizon (for people with disabilities), Youthstart (integration of young people into the labour market), and Integra (for groups at risk of exclusion) – with the aggravating circumstance that the amounts allocated have been significantly reduced. Thus, it is through this initiative that we will implement what the Commission considers to be new methods for combating discrimination and inequalities of all kinds in the context of the labor market, based on the four pillars of the employment policy directives. This is a lot for so few resources. But to ensure that this new methodology has the potential to succeed, the Commission should have opted for a less complex, simpler and more direct proposal, with the participation of NGOs from the beginning of the process, so that partnerships develop in a balanced way. It did not do this. We hope that it will reconsider at least the points we have mentioned. Mr. President, some will remember the successful film ""Cocoon,"" in which elderly people regain a second youth by drinking a particular type of water. It is therefore, in my opinion, extremely important to pay the greatest attention to the water we all drink and to monitor and approve the provisions relating to it. That is why I voted in favour of this common provision, but I would like to stress that I hope that, above all, we will ensure that the water is as pure as possible when it enters our homes. I noticed in the provision that was approved the lack - but I am sure that this will be remedied - of support for those who purify their water at home, in their own homes. Apart from Amendment 76, where I made a mistake, because my intention was to vote in favour, my votes could be explained by the following fiction: Supposed draft environmental directive: ""Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the obligation to maintain a temperature of at least eighteen degrees centigrade in the streets, squares and gardens of European towns and cities during the winter."" The broad outlines of the directive: a) each town must equip itself with sufficient energy and technological resources to achieve this objective by 2012; (b) the costs will be borne entirely by the inhabitants of each city, and will be added to the electricity bill. Opinion of a Member of Parliament from Northern Europe: ""This directive would be unfair because, for example, the cost for a resident of Stockholm would be more than 200 times higher than the cost for a resident of Naples."""	fr
"Work is ongoing in the Member States regarding BSE, a bovine disease, and work is underway to introduce random testing to determine infectivity in the Member States. I know that Ms. Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before, and I promised a rapid solution at the time, but as far as I know, interdepartmental consultations are currently taking place within the Commission. In any case, work is underway. I hope that the next time you ask me this question, I can provide more detailed information. Ms. Jackson asked about the 24 new draft laws and 20 updates and whether this will not lead to even more overregulation. With these regulations, we want to close loopholes in existing laws. This is less about establishing new or additional regulatory systems, although that is part of it, but about identifying and closing weaknesses and gaps in the chain from farm to fork. The accession candidates were mentioned, and we have, of course, thought of that. Food safety and security in many other areas are crucial in connection with enlargement. I have brought this problem to Mr. Verheugen's attention. Commissioner, the ignorance of some member states has brought us to a major food crisis in Europe, and I am, alas, once again annoyed that today, as you present this interesting report, the Council is once again completely absent. I would very much like to know how you intend to ensure that such a new authority, whatever its exact name may be, also has influence over the Council, who has the final say within it, and who issues mandates. Of course, we must not dictate anything substantive, but I do insist that Parliament retain and even expand its powers after Maastricht and Amsterdam. I am very concerned that we will once again have an authority that flies anonymously around Europe like a satellite; I would love such an authority like the devil loves holy water. I hope that this will not happen! I, too, welcome the White Paper. But will the Food Safety Authority also have sufficient authority to prevent phenomena like the beef war and France's refusal to lift the ban? You mentioned that the Commission has the power to withhold grants and subsidies from countries behaving similarly to France. Could you also imagine the Commission, for example, providing interim payments similar to those currently being demanded by British farmers? Mr. President, Commissioner, last week at a briefing, you stated that you believe the future EU Food Safety Authority should not be located on the periphery, but you did not elaborate on what ""periphery"" means. The work of the EU agency relocated to Dublin has proven that geographical distance is no obstacle to efficiency and connections. The main tasks of the future Food Safety Authority were identified as the collection, publication, and coordination of data, the preparation of recommendations for the development of food safety, and—as you said—the collection of scientific information and its dissemination to consumers. All of these things can be achieved anywhere in the European Union using modern technology."	de
I would like to answer both questions as follows. Upon its accession to the European Union, Sweden was permitted to maintain its quantitative restrictions on the alcoholic beverages that travelers from other Member States are permitted to import into the country. This derogation from the principle of free movement of goods and persons expires on 30 June of this year. Sweden now wishes to extend this measure for a further five years, which it argues is necessary in the interest of public health. My position on this is clear. Since joining the Union, Sweden has had sufficient time to adapt its policy to a situation without such import restrictions. Therefore, I see no reason to propose a further extension of this measure. European citizens have the right to purchase goods for their personal use in any Member State, including tax, and to import them into another Member State without these goods being subject to controls or possibly being taxed again. Derogations from this fundamental principle of the internal market must remain temporary exceptions. We want to ensure that Swedish citizens, like other citizens of the European Union, can now enjoy the benefits of the internal market. This does not mean that I do not share Sweden's concern about possible health problems caused by alcohol abuse. However, a recent expert report by Professor Lindgren of Lund University proves that lifting the restrictions would not lead to an increase in alcohol consumption in Sweden. I have already had the opportunity to explain my position to Mr. Ringholm, the Swedish Minister of Finance, twice. Last week, I also discussed this matter with the Finance Committee of the Swedish Parliament. It is now up to the Swedish government to take appropriate steps. Thank you for this reply, Commissioner! First of all, I regret that an error crept into my question to the Commission. It states 2004 as the end date, but it should of course read 1 July 2000. I understand, to a certain extent, the Commission's position that derogations should only be temporary and that the rule should be the norm. Nevertheless, I would like to ask you two questions: Do you nevertheless intend to enter into further discussions with the Swedish government about extending the derogations, for example, as long as such regulations apply to Denmark and Finland? My second question relates to the common alcohol policy. This can be viewed as a matter of the internal market, but also as a matter of public health throughout the EU. What role do alcohol policy and public health aspects play in the Commission's work? Alcohol policy throughout Europe is not only about the internal market, but also about public health. If we had considered these aspects together, the discussions with Sweden might have been easier. I would like to thank Mr. Andersson for the supplementary question to his first question and give him the following answer. First, Finland and Denmark have derogations from the basic principle of the free movement of goods until 2003. These countries are currently preparing measures to ensure that they are prepared for the import of alcoholic beverages in 2003. In the case of Sweden, however, the situation is different. In 1995, an exemption was adopted there for a period of five years, which is now expiring.	de
You previously explained that we are heading for disaster and nothing is being done. We must provide for a rapid procedure! I would like to say first of all that I agree with the priorities regarding the identification of personal responsibilities invoked by the honorable Member. As for the judicial structure, we have had the opportunity to hear Mr. Kouchner describe on several occasions the major difficulties he is encountering in setting up an administrative machine and a judicial structure. We know that the first steps took place several months ago. We are aware of the difficulties, particularly financial ones, that Mr. Kouchner faced in setting up this administrative machine and in particular the difficulty in recruiting police forces for everyday public security. This is a responsibility, Mr. Deputy, that is always present within the framework of the European Union and I would like to tell you that this issue was highlighted, with regard to Kosovo, during the General Affairs Council on Monday. There have been statements and pressures put on the various Member States that have committed to providing police forces. Some Member States have taken refuge behind the fact that they have armed forces on the ground and cannot supplement, as quickly as would be desirable, the police forces they have committed to providing. We are perfectly aware that this circumstance decisively compromises Mr. Kouchner's work, the regularization and normalization of Kosovo's administrative structure, especially the judicial part and police coverage. This has clear and evident negative effects on the ability to regulate the articulation between ethnic groups, and we are aware that if measures are not taken in the short term, we could be heading towards situations of tension like those we experienced a few hours ago and towards a repetition of these situations of tension in other areas of Kosovo. This is an issue that is essentially situated in the NATO context, but on which the European Union has no difficulty in associating itself with NATO's interpretation of these issues. You are aware, Mr. Deputy, of the difficulty that exists in selecting targets during a military action, particularly when it takes place using air assets; you also know that a set of targets target infrastructure and are intended to hamper the functioning of the war machine. We are obviously entering a territory, a gray area, where you will tell me that these are civilian targets, such as bridges, road or rail infrastructure, while others will say that these are military targets, because they serve to support military structures in their aggressive actions, such as those carried out at the time by Mr. Milosevic's forces inside Kosovo. It is this difference in interpretation of military targets that separates us.	fr
At the request of a French Member, Mr. Zimeray, a petition has been submitted. Many have signed it, including myself. However, in accordance with the position consistently expressed by the European Parliament and the entire European Community, I ask you to speak with the prestige of your office and that of the institution you represent before the President and the Governor of the State of Texas, Mr. Bush, who has the power to suspend the death sentence and pardon the condemned man. All of this in accordance with the principles we have always supported. Thank you, Mr. Segni, I will do so very willingly. It is, without a doubt, in line with the positions our Parliament has always adopted. Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to a case that this Parliament has repeatedly addressed. It is the case of Alexander Nikitin. We are all celebrating here that the court has declared him innocent and has shown that in Russia, too, access to information about the environment is a constitutional right. However, it so happens that he is going to be charged again, as the prosecutor will appeal. We know, and we have indeed stated in many resolutions—specifically at the last plenary session last year—that this is not merely a legal case and that it is wrong to accuse Alexander Nikitin of criminal conduct and treason because we, as those affected by its results, benefit from it. These results constitute the basis of the European Barents Sea programs, and I therefore ask you to study a draft letter outlining the most relevant facts and making clear to Russia this position, which is in line with Parliament's decisions. Yes, Mrs. Schroedter, I will gladly examine the facts related to this matter as soon as I receive your letter. Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate you on having kept your promise, since, in this first session of the new year, the number of channels in our offices has indeed been drastically expanded. However, Madam President, what I had requested has not been done. It is true that there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese channel, but there is still no Dutch channel, and I had asked you for a Dutch channel, because we Dutch people would also like to hear the news every month when we are sent into this exile. Therefore, I would like to ask you again to ensure that we can also watch a Dutch channel. Mrs. Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this issue is on the agenda for the Quaestors' meeting scheduled for Wednesday. I hope it will be discussed in a positive spirit. Madam President, could you tell me why this Parliament is not complying with the health and safety legislation it has actually passed? Why hasn't any air quality testing been carried out in this building since we were elected?	es
In these circumstances, could the Commission indicate when it intends to find, under Article 7.1, the existence of a serious and persistent violation by a Member State of the principles set out in Article 6(1) and urge the Council, acting by a qualified majority, to suspend certain rights arising from the application of this Treaty to Austria, in particular the voting rights of the Austrian representative in the Council? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin my reply by recalling the position that the Commission had adopted with regard to the composition of the new Austrian government, reiterated this morning by President Romano Prodi with regard to the Austrian government, which includes ministers belonging to Mr Jörg Haider's Austrian Freedom Party. I refer, of course, to the Commission's statement of 1 February 2000, the broad outline of which I shall begin by recalling. The Commission has affirmed and reaffirms today that it shares the underlying concerns of the Portuguese Presidency's statement of 31 January. These concerns are legitimate and well-founded. There is no need to recall here the political career of Mr Jörg Haider and his numerous xenophobic and racist, and therefore anti-European, public statements. The fact that a clearly extremist, racist, and xenophobic party comes to power in a Member State of the European Union cannot fail to concern the other States participating in the European project, in the same way that it does not leave the European Commission indifferent. Secondly, the Commission has reiterated and reiterates its commitment to continue exercising its duty as guardian of the Treaties, in particular with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union. One of the important innovations of the Treaty of Amsterdam is the introduction of an explicit reference to the fundamental principles that constitute the common heritage of the Member States and the creation of a mechanism for monitoring their compliance and for responding in the event of a violation of one of these principles. The Commission has thus demonstrated in practice its commitment to one of the fundamental principles: that of the rule of law. This principle obliges the Commission to act within the limits set by the Treaties, and it is in this context that its statement of 1 February is made. The Commission is not a State and cannot and should not act in such a capacity. But, to answer the honourable Member's question concretely, it should be recalled that the mechanism established by Article 7(1) of the Treaty on European Union requires, in order to be activated, that there be a finding of, I quote, a serious and persistent violation of the principles set out in Article 6. A serious and persistent violation, I repeat, constitutes the essential condition for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council the adoption of measures against a Member State. It seems to me clear that the conditions for the application of this mechanism to the situation in Austria are not met. Furthermore, I think I am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of serious and persistent violation of human rights and democracy will never be met either for Austria or for any other Member State of the Union.	fr
This system is financed through a special fund to which buyers of new vehicles contribute. Mrs Breyer, is this ecologically reprehensible? In my opinion, not. The Netherlands is an exemplary model for the disposal of vehicles as proposed by the directive. The question of whether the costs of this should fall on the buyer of a new vehicle or on the manufacturer in the case of a vehicle already in circulation has nothing to do with ecology, but is a purely competitive issue! The question is whether a European manufacturer should set aside EUR 250 million and a Korean manufacturer perhaps EUR 2 million. Taking into account the people employed in the automotive sector in Europe, I am in favour of not creating distortions of competition. In the interests of environmental protection, however, I want to ensure that the system is free for the last owner, which should be financed through a special fund, and I want to ensure that manufacturers are responsible for new vehicles, because then they will also have the responsibility to build vehicles that are easy to recycle! (Applause from the PSE Group benches) Mr President, there are many positive aspects to this proposal, particularly in terms of waste management, reuse, recovery and recycling of components and materials, etc. I think it is a very good proposal. The main point of discussion is: is it the manufacturer, the end-user or someone else who is responsible for taking back the end-of-life vehicle free of charge or not? I will give the example of my country in order to make it clear how the system works without any problems. We have an agreement with all the parties involved, namely the car manufacturers, the second-hand car dealers, the confederation of the automotive industry, the metal processing companies, the scrapping operators and the public authority. An agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis for environmental protection. The automotive industry, and Belgium is a country with a high production of vehicles, has not raised any problems. Our fellow citizens can hand over their end-of-life vehicles to the end-user free of charge. As a result, we have noticed - contrary to what is claimed here, namely that this would be to the detriment of employment - that a number of small businesses are doing a very good job of recycling materials. Some businesses have taken a leading role, as they are able to recycle certain materials, including some that have not yet been transposed into the directive. This means that we are developing a new sector, creating new jobs, and at the same time doing a great service to the environment. I am in favour of free take-back. In my country, we have succeeded in doing so; why shouldn't we succeed in doing so elsewhere? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this interesting debate, full of important arguments. I ask you to bear with me for a few more minutes. Allow me to briefly outline some of the principles and starting points from which this directive was based. I would first like to begin with some comments and some responses to the most important remarks that have characterised this debate.	it
As acknowledged in the Swoboda report, its conditions do not call for peace, but for greater political and economic influence over the country, control of its natural wealth, exploitation of its workforce and use of the country as a base of operations against nations and peoples in the region who oppose the new order. All this is offered in exchange for the promise of the country's future membership of the Union. The report welcomes these orientations as well as the EU's more general policy towards South-Eastern Europe. It is significant that the report praises FYROM for its constructive attitude during the NATO aggression. It praises its peaceful role in accepting the deployment of NATO forces on its territory, but nothing is said about the indignation expressed by its people in the mass mobilisations against the continued NATO bombing. Finally, since we believe that the Stability Pact and the Stabilisation and Association Procedure applied by the Union to the countries of the region will cause new problems in those areas and new horrors for their inhabitants, further strengthening the hegemonic role of the American and European imperialists, we will vote against the report in order to express solidarity with the people of FYROM. Mr President, Commissioner, one of the fundamental objectives of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is the consolidation of stability and peace in the region, which of course presupposes the development and maintenance of good neighbourly relations between the countries concerned. I will not bore you with the details of the question of the name of FYROM which, as you are no doubt aware, is a source of conflict with Greece and has been the subject of negotiations between the two countries for more than four years, under the aegis of the UN Secretary-General in the context of the relevant Security Council resolutions, but also of an agreed commitment between the parties under Article 5 of the so-called Interlocutory Agreement of 1995. I believe it is appropriate to point out that, on the occasion of the forthcoming negotiations and the definition of the association agreement, the European side must make it clear to the Government in Skopje that it needs to demonstrate adequate and constructive political will in order to make a decisive contribution to the successful conclusion of the New York talks. I would like to hope that such a European request, bearing in mind the difficulties that a possible postponement would cause for the completion and implementation of the Association Agreement, will receive the attention it deserves and will be taken into due account by the Government of Skopje so as to respond adequately to the compromise position taken by Greece on this matter and to the real and generally declared intention of all EU Member States - Greece included - to facilitate and contribute to the path of FYROM towards a united Europe. In fact, Mr President, I do not believe that the smooth and harmonious development of relations, contacts and communications between FYROM and Greece, which should be ensured above all by the practical solutions of the Interlocutory Agreement, can sufficiently satisfy the criteria and conditions of good neighbourly relations, as is moreover required in view of the negotiations and conclusion of the Association Agreement.	it
. This is a sector where liberalization has shown its limits and serious shortcomings. I am not personally a narrow-minded activist for monopoly, whether public or private... but when I see the results of private companies in this area, I am comforted and strengthened in my position as a defender of public service! If liberalization continues, in this area too, there is a great risk of one day seeing entire regions not served by the post office. Who can indeed believe for a moment that private companies, whose only driving force is profit, would continue to serve high-cost areas unless they made already disadvantaged residents pay this cost, and who therefore would not be able to benefit from it. I would add that today, at a time when Europe is revealing itself and asserting itself as incapable of opposing the presence of fascists in a European Union government, it is no longer acceptable to see us impose an ultraliberalism that destroys public services, in the name of this same Europe. I am a European and even a federalist. To achieve this, I was ready, I am ready to make sacrifices... but not at any price! And above all, I am no longer ready to accept the construction of a single liberal market if Europe is not at the same time able to defend the values on which it was founded and which made me, since the 1960s, a convinced European! The President. Parliament has exhausted its agenda. The minutes of this sitting will be submitted to Parliament for adoption at the beginning of the next part-session.1 Adjournment of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned. (The sitting adjourned at 11:10 a.m.) Resumption of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament, which was suspended on Friday, 18 February 2000, resumed. Statement by the President Dear colleagues, as you know, on 22 February, ETA struck again brutally in Spain with the assassination of Fernando Buesa Blanco, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party of Biscay and spokesperson for the Socialist Party in the Basque Parliament, and Jorge Díez Elorza, his bodyguard. On the same day, I expressed, on my own behalf and on behalf of our European Parliament, our deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims' families. These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy. I strongly condemned this act of barbarity, unworthy of any civilised society. The rule of law and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is founded. Terrorism, in whatever form it takes, is unacceptable. Hoping that these men will be the last victims of ETA, I call on the organization to put a definitive end to its use of violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain. I invite you, dear colleagues, to observe a minute of silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge Díez Elorza.	fr
Resolution on women in decision-making (B5-0180/2000) My group abstained on the resolution on women in decision-making, much to our regret. But it regrets even more that such resolutions are still necessary. In 1994, the Greens were the first group in this Parliament in which women formed a majority; they were the first to have a female Secretary-General, Dominique Voynet, now French Minister of the Environment; and the German Greens were the first political party to implement gender equality in order to correct the overall underrepresentation of women in political institutions. Since then, this initiative has been followed by certain parties, and it cannot be said that voters have risen up to condemn these parties for their actions. Nor have voters felt manipulated by such quotas. The resolution clearly states that the proportional system, which allows for the representation of women, is necessary and that political parties must act accordingly. We welcome this. We agree with those who argue that people should be selected on the basis of their merits; which is true. Our culture should allow for gender balance and people should be able to develop their talents whatever they may be, but at the moment, our culture and values do not reflect this belief. Prejudices, stereotypes, are widespread. It will come as no surprise that people from minorities, whether black, gay, disabled, etc., are subject to discrimination and unfair treatment if a majority group, women, must also suffer this discrimination. Our group therefore supports affirmative action; only when women are fairly represented in the decision-making process will men also be fairly represented. We should therefore also create a culture where your paid and unpaid work, your salary, your parental leave and your pension do not depend on your gender. As International Women's Day approaches, I wish to reaffirm my support for the action taken within the institutions and Member States to promote women's access to positions of responsibility, particularly in politics. This is why I will vote with conviction for the text of this resolution, which urges us to take more proactive measures to combat the discrimination that persists and prevents women from occupying their rightful place in our society! The promotion of women in the decision-making process has been one of the priority areas of the European Union's action programme on equal opportunities since 1995 and is part of the repeated commitments of both the Union's institutions and the Member States when they talk about gender equality. However, while progress has been made in recent years thanks to strategies such as mainstreaming and complementary measures such as positive action, it is too little to be satisfactory. The under-representation of women in politics, for example, continues to be a reality. However, we know the importance of seeing many women involved in politics.	fr
This is terrible because the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable ACP countries and will be the ones that will have to pay the highest price for this new Lomé Convention. On the other hand, on the trade front, the WTO has pressured us to ensure that the new Lomé Convention is compatible with their interests, which has led to a huge push for so-called regional economic partnership agreements or free trade agreements. It is possible that the more developed ACP countries will be subject to great pressure to accept these agreements. However, it is very clear that, even after a period of adjustment, some countries will not be able to open their markets to the cold winds of free trade without their domestic economies collapsing. We therefore need to be especially careful to ensure that genuine options are being given to countries that are not yet ready for free trade agreements. We must ensure that strategies to promote regional integration within the ACP are genuinely being pursued. Finally, when any other trade summit is held, EU and ACP countries should jointly lobby for the reform of Article 24 of the GATT to explicitly provide for non-reciprocal regional trade agreements between groups of countries with structural and economic differences. The Lomé Convention is a unique partnership in the world; but for it to be truly effective, discussions within its context are not enough; we must also count on the collaboration of the WTO and participation in other international negotiation forums. Mr. President, in this debate, I would like to denounce the fate of those poor countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific, which some dare to claim to be beneficiaries of the Lomé Convention. Even at the level of trade relations alone, the Lomé Convention has not in the least protected those countries whose already restricted share of trade with Europe has been halved. This reflects the growing inequalities between EU and ACP countries. The Lomé Convention primarily benefits a few large industrial or financial groups that continue to plunder these countries and perpetuate their economic dependence, particularly on the former colonial powers. As for the aid supposedly intended for development, it is obviously useless, as the underdevelopment of most of these countries deepens rather than diminishes, even if this aid does not constitute a disguised subsidy to European industrial exporters. This aid is above all a providential gift for the regimes in power, with no benefit to the poor majority of the population. Even if it were properly redirected, it would be insufficient to finance essential infrastructure for health, education, or drinking water supplies. For several years now, the major powers have been reducing the amount of this already paltry aid. The height of cynicism is that they sometimes do so under the pretext of disregard for human rights or corruption. But who protects these regimes that foster corruption, if not the governments of rich countries? In fact, we turn a blind eye to the main corruptors, those large oil, water supply or public works groups, against whom we could act with rigor since they have their headquarters here in Europe,	es
In three weeks, I will be in Paris and will continue, capital after capital, participating, from my position, in this dialogue. I consider it extraordinarily positive—and I wanted to thank you—that you have taken this initiative. Secondly, I would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency, and in particular Mr. Seixas da Costa, for your willingness. Furthermore, what you said earlier clearly expresses this willingness and interest: the Portuguese Presidency cannot be an intermediate Presidency. It is the one that will launch these negotiations. We know perfectly well that they cannot be concluded during these six months and that the baton will then be passed to the French Presidency, with the hope that they will be concluded before the end of 2000. And not just concluded, but also successful, which is not exactly the same thing. Concluding a negotiation is not the same as achieving success in it. The baton will be passed on, but the conditions under which you, Mr. President, and the Portuguese Presidency pass on that baton will be extraordinarily important, as will its nature. All the work that will be done together, particularly that promoted by you, during these months, is extraordinarily important. We have great confidence, great hopes, in the way the Portuguese Presidency, that of a small country—but one that will not cease to have, but must have, great ambitions—will successfully carry out this task. Having listened to Prime Minister Guterrez, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and you, I have that confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and in the very determined way it will guide these negotiations. In these months, you can count on the cooperation of the Commission. Finally, I repeat: we will have to make a great effort to popularize the issues of these negotiations. These are difficult issues. They are matters of politics and institutional mechanics that are not always easy to explain. All the more reason for MEPs, ministers, and Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining this to the public and to public debate. In this regard, the Commission will take initiatives, ladies and gentlemen, to launch and encourage this public debate. Provision of cross-border services The next item is the joint debate on the following reports: A5-0007/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (COM(1999)3 - C4-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD)) on the conditions governing the posting of employees who are nationals of a third country in the framework of the cross-border provision of services. A5-0012/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council directive (COM(1999)3 - C4-0096/1999 - 1999/0013(CNS)) extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to nationals of a third State established within the Community. Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I must apologize for my slightly strained voice, but as an Austrian Member, there has been a lot to say and say today.	es
"The news of recent weeks about how modern technologies enable wiretapping makes us more careful: we do not want the dark scenarios described by Orwell to become an even more crude and worrying reality. Well, this is only the beginning of a great deal of work in the field of law, which must go hand in hand with the growth of the Europe we want. Mr President, for the benefit of Mr Schulz, I would like to point out that amendments by committees and political groups are admissible in Plenary, but not those by a single Member, in an individual capacity. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully understand the frustration of Mr Di Pietro, who had to carry out an enormous amount of work in a short space of time in order to present the report under consideration today. Crime in the European Union has increased so much that we cannot be satisfied with a gradual approach to the problem of mutual legal assistance in criminal matters. In this case, the European Parliament certainly cannot be blamed; Indeed, it is the governments of the Member States that have reduced the margin for manoeuvre to a minimum, thus forcing the European Parliament to face a kind of mission impossible. We must accept the idea that any means, however modest, must be used to improve the system of legal assistance. Paradoxically, I could say that it would be better to talk as little as possible about this report because, the more we make it clear that these are only small steps, the more criminals rub their hands and the more obvious the disproportion between their organisations and the serious shortcomings in cooperation between the judicial authorities become. I urge the Council of Ministers to face reality, taking into account in particular the imbalance between crime and the legislation in force. The aim is to provide the judicial authorities - especially the magistrates, but also the citizens concerned - with the tools to combat crime while respecting the fundamental guarantees of defence and the basic principles of human rights. Otherwise, our work would be completely useless. I also call for greater harmonisation of criminal law in the Member States. In my opinion, this is the only way to combat crime effectively and across borders. However, until such harmonisation has been achieved, the greatest possible coherence is needed to move forward with mutual legal assistance. To this end, I have tabled an amendment, according to which mutual legal assistance may only be granted if criminal proceedings are being carried out for acts which are punishable under the law in force in both the requesting party and the requested Member State. The content of the amendment which I tabled is also reiterated in Amendment No 43, which contains this cumulative requirement. This cumulative requirement is essential, since in my opinion the principle of legality ""nulla poena sine lege"" must be respected in criminal law. Consequently, any request for mutual legal assistance relating to an act which is supposedly not punishable in the requested Member State is contrary to this principle and therefore to the fundamental principles of the law of the requested Member State."	it
I hope that this time too Parliament's commitment will be as intense. Mr President, during the period of the last financial perspectives, 1994-1999, which included 13 Community initiatives, the cross-border programme INTERREG II proved to be an important initiative. The inclusion of the INTERREG initiative in the new round of the Structural Funds 2000-2006 is, in my view, a clear indication of how important this initiative is to the Member States of the European Union. INTERREG I, for the period 1989-1993, and INTERREG II, for the period 1994-1999, were a huge success in terms of bringing neighbouring Member States closer together in economic and social development. Coming from the border counties of North West Ireland, I have witnessed first-hand over the years the important role played by INTERREG I and II and I am delighted to celebrate the launch of INTERREG III. The Commission has allocated GBP 67 million to the INTERREG III programme, which will be used to continue cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The European Union has played a major role in the development of the Border Counties region in Ireland in the past: the Union is the largest contributor to the International Fund for Ireland, with GBP 80 million. The Union contributes 75 percent of the funds for the Peace and Reconciliation Programme. All in all, INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation Programme have played an important role in the ongoing peace process. Mr President, I will limit myself to a few critical points on INTERREG, obviously also to respect the time limit on my speech. We have all expressed a positive assessment of the confirmation of this programme and of the extension of the areas of intervention, beyond cross-border cooperation, to transnational and transregional cooperation. This does not prevent us, however, from being aware of the fact that the majority of the resources - from 50 to 80 percent - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, on section A of the INTERREG III programme; the choice that was made to consolidate the current areas of cooperation on this section, with regard to the choice of eligible regions, we continue to believe is wrong and contradictory. We hope and wish that the Executive Commission will dwell on this and recognise in substance, and not with formal homage, the position of the Parliament. Cross-border cooperation continues to concern almost exclusively land borders and, where exceptions have been made with reference to maritime borders, these exceptions are not transparent in the choices and often suffer from compensations with other fronts of Community policies. Discrimination is enormously more serious for the islands that experience a regional condition that can only be linked to borders of an exclusively maritime nature. This is in line with a discrimination that continues to be used by ignoring the content of Article 158 of the Treaty, with reference to island regions with regard to cohesion policies. Even more serious is that this occurs by ignoring the new data linked to the direction that has been taken with the enlargement process towards regions such as Malta.	it
If this is done, they too will be willing to decisively support enlargement and participate in it. Mr. President of the Commission, if we are unable to put into practice the proven solidarity between rich and poor regions, the Union will become poorer as a result and will not gain the support of the population. Madam President, Mr. President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the formulation of new programs must not make us forget the old ones that are currently in the implementation phase. From this point of view, it will be useful for the Commission's work program to return to the themes of Agenda 2000, the Common Agricultural Policy, which includes fisheries, and secondly, the activities of the Structural Funds. Mr. President of the Commission, I hope this reference means that the reorganization of the Commission will not harm the current monitoring and implementation mechanism for Agenda 2000. Of course, the themes of Agenda 2000 are mentioned in its third and fourth strategic objectives: the economic and social agenda and improved quality of life. What is not evident in your texts is to what extent the high, generous objectives correspond to the resources the Commission will mobilize. And I am not necessarily referring to financial resources. Ultimately, implementing Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not necessarily require more resources; it also requires savings. It is about analytical resources: investing intellectual capital in these areas. Because it is essential to meet two objectives: safeguarding the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture, and doing so by facilitating the liberalization of world trade in agricultural products, primarily for the benefit of developing countries. It is not easy to combine the two objectives. It is not obvious. There may possibly be contradictions between the two objectives, and we have no indication that the Commission has pointed out these contradictions or how it intends to resolve them. Regarding the other aspect of the agenda, Mr. President of the Commission, that of cohesion and regional development, of course we do have great achievements to present, but we still have lagging regions, especially island regions, to which we should direct more attention. And on the subject of fisheries, there is nothing in your program that says that the predatory exploitation of fish, which ultimately caused the disappearance of entire species, will have any kind of result in the future. Perhaps more attention and more esprit de finesse are needed on these issues. Madam President, I would like to begin by emphasizing the caution expressed by many colleagues here when referring to this five-year plan. When we set very ambitious long-term objectives, we must not lose sight of the present. This is an argument that the leader of my group, Mr. Poettering, presented very convincingly in his opening remarks. The Union must not take on a whole host of new tasks without meeting the basic requirements for a prosperous European economy.	es
First, I am naturally pleased by the renewed attention you are paying to the Mediterranean region, whether because it represents the European Union's contribution to the Middle East peace process or because it continues and expands the historical and political ties between the countries of Southeastern Europe. Given current geopolitical processes, we believe that the Mediterranean border deserves the same importance as the eastward enlargement sought by Parliament and the Commission. Second, the internal market. We, as Members of the European Parliament, consider the harmonization of existing civil law provisions to be essential. Perhaps we should also gradually address administrative law. Furthermore, we feel every day how urgently there is a common legal system whose sources are harmonised. Third, preparatory acts. I support the call to limit the number of such acts, which are submitted to the European Parliament multiple times and from different sources. Although Green Papers, White Papers, and Communications contribute—which is certainly very important—to deepening the debate, they also have a complicated and problematic side effect, in that they generally delay legislative action in areas that absolutely require rapid action. Finally, I believe that the Commission's programme has neglected two areas to which the European institutions must pay particular attention, particularly in light of the increasing spread of electronic commerce. The Commission should put forward proposals on out-of-court settlement of disputes concerning so-called online contracts and on amending the Distance Contracting Directive in order to continually improve consumer protection. Mr President, as regards fisheries, I do not wish to go into the details of the Commission's legislative proposal. Instead, I would like to receive a clear assurance that the Commission will seek a solution to swiftly transpose the recommendations of regional and international fisheries organizations into Community legislation. We already had the opportunity to discuss this issue of the Commission's delays during the previous part-session, on the occasion of the Gallagher report on ICCAT recommendations on bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean. These delays threaten to become a very serious problem because, although these recommendations become binding within a certain period, their absence from Community legislation encourages non-compliance by fleets and can lead to infringement proceedings against the European Union. Delays in implementation are an endemic problem for the Commission. For example, we have been waiting since 1996 for the ban on landings from Honduras and Belize to be incorporated into Community legislation, or since 1998 for the control of albacore tuna fishing in Community waters to be included. The Commission constantly accuses Member States of failing to transpose Commission decisions or directives into national law, while doing exactly the same thing internationally. The Commission's proposal for an amending communication from international organizations is clearly an attempt to expedite the legislative process by separating both Parliament and the Council. From our institution's perspective, this raises serious doubts as to whether this is the best way to resolve this problem. I expect President Prodi to make a commitment to resolve this issue once and for all, and to ensure that Parliament is always involved in the legislative process for incorporating the recommendations of international fisheries organizations into Community legislation.	de
We no longer have a choice. It is imperative. European citizens will not accept anything less than the quality of life that suits them as human beings. We do not want the US model—a model that has spectacularly failed to create the employment necessary for a decent quality of life. This model has dramatically increased the number of working poor in the United States. This is not what we want to do in Europe. Solidarity is in the traditions of Europe, and we have the experience of doing things better. However, we must seize the necessary tools to do so. That is why I urge that we set up the high-level group, as proposed by the Commission, but also that we go further and have a process based on the Luxembourg process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue relating to social protection. Mr President, Madam Commissioner, this is one of the social areas to which the European Union must pay the greatest attention. In fact, macroeconomic policies, the Stability Pact and the nominal convergence criteria have acted as obstacles to a modernisation of social protection that could contribute to improving people's quality of life, particularly through a significant increase in pensions and retirement benefits - particularly minimum pensions - and combating social exclusion. This situation is particularly serious for countries such as Portugal, where the minimum pension barely exceeds half the national minimum wage, which is the lowest in the entire European Union. Therefore, as long as the Commission does not recognise the need to change macroeconomic policies to create more quality jobs and guarantee the rights of those who hold them, which is the fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a sound public social protection system, we will maintain the greatest reservations about its position. Although the Anderson report incorporated some positive proposals, including some of those we had put forward, it still contains some of the basics that we criticized in the Commission's original proposal, and the strategy for modernizing social protection continues to concern us. Mr. President, I previously ran two manufacturing companies, one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands. As the company in the United Kingdom grew, we invested in staff increases, and as the company in the Netherlands grew, we invested in additional machinery. The reason for this was simply that social costs were too high in the Netherlands. I support social protection, I support the original Commission document, but I do not want to see people lose their jobs because social protection costs become unrealistic and too high. This is why I asked in committee for a business impact assessment to be carried out so that the costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account, and the PPE-DE Group supported this amendment. However, I must point out that other groups, led by the PES Group, which is led by my compatriot Stephen Hughes, voted against this amendment. I accept that Mr Andersson's report has the best intentions and I respect him for the work he has done, but in my view, the way in which the report defines and promotes social convergence would lead to an increase in social costs across the EU.	fr
Finally, we call for changes in the methods and ratios used to disburse the funds. There needs to be greater involvement of the private sector, which will introduce a perspective of financial realism into the financing project. In addition, the type of projects that are financed needs to change. No more small-scale projects that only aim at income, and which are difficult to monitor, but instead large-scale projects, whose benefits in most cases are clear. This will address the much talked about need for transparency in the use of these resources, while countering the temptation to drag things out needlessly by continuing to absorb local taxpayers' money in the areas where the projects in question are located, while the European Parliament will demonstrate that it takes the need for reform very seriously. If the House supports the amendments to the report that I have presented today, I believe that we will be able to move on to the next stage, which is to achieve the historic objectives for which the Funds were established, namely to provide assistance - in a financially sustainable way - to the poor areas of the European Union that need a decent standard of living, not so much by giving them charity but by giving them a push forward. I call on the House to vote in favour of the amendments that I have presented. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done, which is serious and comprehensive. There is no doubt that the European Union's structural policies and cohesion policy are the essential tools for creating the conditions for development and for reducing economic and social inequalities between the various regions, since disparities, despite the efforts made, remain high, and unacceptably high in the area of unemployment. To ensure that the objectives of these policies are better achieved, it is essential to ensure their coordination and organisation on the basis of carefully and, if I may, intelligently developed guidelines. It should not be forgotten that these policies, when they are effective, are also visible to the European citizen who benefits from them, who experiences a direct improvement in his or her quality of life. Nor should it be forgotten that particular attention will need to be paid to the Union's island and outermost areas, which face enormous obstacles to their economic and social development precisely because of their geographical position; provided, of course, that the Commission does not intend to build bridges and dig underwater tunnels to connect them to the rest of the continent. In conclusion, I would like to stress that structural policies as a whole need greater flexibility, in order to be able to adapt more easily to changing circumstances, thus being able to face the new challenges and opportunities brought about by the advent of the new millennium, for which we all wish the best. Mr President, Mrs Schroedter's report certainly contains many useful observations and I congratulate her, but I remain of the opinion that, faced with the orientations and results of the Community's regional policy, our concern should be even greater. In short, the colossal mass unemployment is not only not alleviated by regional policy, but is actually aggravated by it. The rural economy and the agricultural regions are in fact being irreparably affected by this policy, with dramatic consequences both for employment in rural areas and for the standard of living of farmers, especially in southern Europe.	it
"The rights of information and scrutiny that Parliament has obtained in the past must now be clearly redefined, according to the Treaty of Amsterdam, by an interinstitutional agreement. Our rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, has done a meticulous job and highlighted the issues that need to be clarified within the framework of this interinstitutional agreement, as well as the internal administrative procedures within Parliament that may need to be amended. The main problem remains the time factor. Once Parliament is informed, it must, as a general rule, adopt a position within a very short period of four weeks, if it so wishes. As soon as issues involving the health and safety of citizens within the European Union are addressed, the Commission, which has the role of guardian of the Treaties and remains the only institution with the right of initiative, must be able to react very quickly, sometimes within a few days or even hours. However, the European Parliament's right to information and possibly to react must be preserved. In response to these difficulties, our rapporteur proposes very useful solutions that my political group can only support. I have one final request to make. In point 2 of the German version of the draft resolution, a passage has been mistranslated. I urgently request clarification on this, also after the fact, from the people responsible for printing. Instead of ""must be renewed,"" I believe it should have read ""must be maintained."" This is not formulated as clearly in the German text. I would therefore like this passage to be checked. Apart from that, I sincerely thank our rapporteur. This is a difficult subject, and I hope that the way we have approached it will enable us to make better use of it from now on. Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on his report. I must add that seeing Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions is a welcome change. When it comes to the IGC, it is one of those what the French call ""the hardliners"": no compromise, no agreement with the other institutions; they would prefer the whole process to be blocked rather than compromise on their position. Yet here it is, ready to accept the steps forward that have been taken, which fall far short of Parliament's original position on the issue of comitology. Let us remember what is at stake here. Parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed before the new Council decision, to which this interinstitutional agreement was added. First, the system as a whole is obscure. It lacks transparency, and hundreds of committees with secret agendas meet without anyone knowing who sits on each committee. A real step forward has been made in the new system that has been adopted. We will know who sits on each committee. We will know when they meet. We'll get the agendas. We'll get the documents that will be sent to them. The entire system will be more open and transparent—even if it remains rather complex."	fr
Even in very wealthy Member States and cities, large numbers of people live in ghettos with inadequate facilities, very poor schooling, underdeveloped physical infrastructure, and widespread drug and other abuse. It seems to me that for the European Union to demonstrate that it is helping the citizens of the European Union, it must help Member States demonstrate that the Union is working for those citizens and their families. This program has been very successful in Ireland, as I know it has been in other countries. It took a while to get going there, but the reason for that was that the people of the region had to develop these programs themselves. It is important that they use their own local initiative and expertise in developing this initiative. It would be very easy to ensure rapid and timely development if professional experts from outside were involved, but that would undermine the overall objective of the Urban program. I want to make one more point before concluding: we must insist that wherever funding is allocated and wherever this program is developed, it is done within the framework of a serious urban development policy. Sadly, this is not the case in Ireland. I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL program and the objective of integrating discriminated groups into the labor market. Development partnerships are a very sound idea, although they are experimental. However, I have two major concerns about development partnerships. They should be accessible to smaller groups so that they can design, implement, and monitor the programs. The programs must be very flexible. I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language, not jargon, so that everyone can access them. I am pleased to see that this has been taken into account in this report, but I cannot accept Amendment 9 because it is really not written in plain language. My second concern was that certain discriminated groups face specific problems, for example, access for disabled people to their workplace. Projects should also specifically address this problem. These concerns must be taken into account when defining programmes. I certainly intend to do so with organisations and groups in my constituency in the West Midlands. I now come to the controversial issue of asylum seekers and refugees. Although I do not support refugees who have been refused refugee status and who have been threatened with repatriation having access to EQUAL, I will support the possibility of access to EQUAL for all other asylum seekers and refugees. It is only right and just that they should have access to EQUAL on the same basis as everyone else. Mr President, dear colleagues, with the Leader report, rural development is in the spotlight.	fr
Yet another example is the plan to eliminate jobs in Europe by the ABB-Alsthom Power trust. 18 million unemployed, 50 million poor in the European Union, despite it being one of the richest regions in the world: this is the result of this competition that the European institutions intend to encourage. The desire to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market, expressed by the Commission, is ridiculous because the only law that competition obeys is the law of the jungle in which the most powerful crush or swallow up the weakest. This is especially revolting from a social point of view. The European Commission's report shows, crudely, that the institutions of the Union are only interested in the large capitalist groups that engage in this economic war and not at all in the victims it claims. Nothing is done to prevent the increase in unemployment, nothing to protect workers, nothing to prevent large companies from pushing part of the population into poverty, with the sole aim of further enriching their shareholders! The only merit that we can recognize in this report is that it demonstrates that the hard-working majority of society has nothing to hope for from the European institutions to preserve, much less to improve, their living conditions. By voting against this report, we are speaking for all those who have expressed their rejection, in Seattle and elsewhere in Europe, of a world entrusted to pure mercantile logic. We are voting against this report in the name of the development of public services, and in particular, in memory of the victims of the train accident at Paddington station, who were killed not by accident but by the absurd determination to replace regulation with competition. All in all, this report is a primitive text that is inspired only by the law of the jungle, because competition cannot solve any of the problems that humanity must face at this turn of the century. Whether it is a question of the balance of the biosphere, the promotion of culture or cooperation with the third world, excessive competition is a factor of regression and insecurity. Do you think that the 18 million unemployed in Europe are victims of an overly timid application of this competition policy? We are convinced of the opposite and we do not even think that State aid is, by definition, too high. In relation to what iron rule, what criteria of effectiveness, would it be so? Finally, after Seattle, do you think it is serious to advocate a greater role for the WTO? Only legal advisers to multinationals can demonstrate such obstinacy. Jonckheer report (A5-0087/1999) I welcome the quality of the seventh survey of State aid in the European Union, the fact that it is now published annually and the fact that the Directorate-General for Competition publishes general and detailed information for the public on its website. I am satisfied with the rapporteur's approach to State aid and I congratulate him. Too often, in fact, there is a tendency to stigmatise State aid as measures that distort competition.	it
The only way to push back negative ideas is to express others. This brings me back to the subject of our debate: I am deeply convinced of the value and democratic power of debate, particularly when it comes to combating demagoguery. Mr Barnier, in your statement you stressed the importance of dialogue with European citizens. With regard to the IGC, it is true that, following the decisions taken in Helsinki, the Portuguese Presidency is expressly entitled to extend the agenda for the IGC during the IGC. Parliament is represented there by Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos. But could you, Mr Barnier, promise us that you will inform Parliament if the agenda is extended, so that we can address it within Parliament and in dialogue with you, so that the dialogue with citizens to which you attach so much importance can continue? (FR) Mr Beazley, my answer is clearly yes, but it is not really new. Chairman Napolitano and many members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and even more Members here in the House, know that I am prepared, on behalf of the Commission, to report transparently and simultaneously on how things are developing during these negotiations. I may do so using different words than Professor Tsatsos and Elmar Brok, their direct representatives. Moreover, we will probably do this together in many cases. I consider it very important that these negotiations do not proceed without the European Parliament or the national parliaments being kept constantly informed, especially since—as I would remind you—they will ultimately have to take a position on them during the ratification process. That is why I welcomed Mr. Napolitano's initiative to hold regular joint consultations between the national parliaments of the fifteen countries and the European Parliament. Irrespective of this, the duty of transparency regarding institutional reform begins here. I will therefore always be available, whenever you wish, to report to you throughout this year on our positions and the progress of these negotiations. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the Commission on its approach. I consider it crucial to engage with citizens in a timely manner, something that essentially never happened with either the Amsterdam Treaty or the Maastricht Treaty, and consequently has only sown distrust. Two questions: First, you said you wanted to initiate a dialogue with citizens and begin with 700 interns at the European Commission. Do you also intend to address the population through the media, including television and the internet? My second question is of a critical nature. The European Commission has just presented a transparency proposal. If I compare it with the proposal that is to form the basis of legislation here in the Netherlands, it is nowhere near as ambitious, and this proposal has already met with fierce criticism in the Netherlands. I would just like to know how you intend to ensure transparency with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference, because the current directive does not provide a good example of this.	de
The issue of UCITS may seem difficult, technical, and politically quite risky. In my opinion, not everyone necessarily knows what UCITS represent. However, let me strongly emphasize that this issue really concerns European citizens, because it is a question of how their savings will be managed, what choices exist, how inter-community competition will operate with regard to different types of savings, whether savers are entitled to a certain security as investors, and what opportunities are available to European citizens to prepare for their old age through wise saving. It is also a question of weighing the demand for liberalization aimed at making the market more efficient and increasing profits against the need to protect investors. During the 1980s, most markets were subject to radical deregulation, the main consequence of which was the very rapid development, within a few years, of national financial and bond markets. Collective investment funds have established themselves as an alternative to individual bank savings. Sixty percent of Swedes save through various investment funds. This type of savings provides investors with security due to the diversity of investments. The capital and bond markets have continued to grow. The current UCITS Directive has become obsolete. New types of investment funds have been introduced in individual countries, but the UCITS concerned are not allowed to market their units in other Member States. This restriction, of course, hinders competition and innovation, and limits the public's savings choices. The Commission proposal we are discussing today has two parts. The first concerns products, i.e., investment funds. The second part concerns investment undertakings. The first proposal essentially aims to expand the investment possibilities for these undertakings by allowing them to invest in assets belonging to other investment companies, for example, units of other UCITS, standardized futures and options, deposits in credit institutions and certain types of money market instruments. Special risk-spreading rules, based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria, are provided for these investments. The proposal also calls for specific risk-spreading rules for undertakings whose objective is to replicate stock market indices, so-called index funds. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is strengthening the requirements compared to the Commission's proposal. In order to ensure transparent operation and a sound situation, investments in non-harmonized funds should only be permitted if qualitative criteria, such as transparency and investor protection, are implemented. In addition, quantitative criteria (risk exposure) should be applied. Allow me, Mr President, to address the point on which there is some disagreement, which I hope will be resolved later, namely over-the-counter derivatives. The Commission makes a distinction in its proposal between derivatives that are traded on a regulated market and those that are not. The latter are called over-the-counter derivatives. According to the Commission's proposal, over-the-counter derivatives do not fall within the categories of investments that may be considered for UCITS; they should only be used for the purposes of sound portfolio management and reducing exchange rate risks.	fr
This is, moreover, not a recent communication, dating back to 28 April 1999, that is, almost a year ago. The document comes from the previous Commission and is clearly the fruit of the work that Commissioner Papoutsis carried out during his mandate and which culminated in the Luxembourg Summit and his Philoxenia programme, the failed Philoxenia programme. I believe that today's discussion is the first that Parliament is having with the new Commission, with a new head, Commissioner Liikanen, who is listening very carefully to what is being said in the Chamber. I would like to take this opportunity to ask him a couple of questions directly. The first: the Intergovernmental Conference is starting. At the Maastricht Conference in 1992, the governments committed themselves to inserting a legal basis in the Treaties; this commitment was not reflected in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, so it is still a pending commitment and there is even a Council resolution from last June on tourism and employment. What does Commissioner Liikanen expect from the inclusion of this aspect in the new Intergovernmental Conference? The second question is much more direct and probably more challenging: in the light of the failure of the efforts made in the last decade, as Mr Koch has pointed out, does Commissioner Liikanen believe he can work during his mandate to ensure that this common dimension of tourism can be the subject of its own policy, given the importance of tourism in creating jobs, as all the previous speakers have pointed out? Will the new Commission come forward with new initiatives to ensure that, through the continuous effort of the Commission and Parliament - a bit like a drop of water that erodes the rock - the Council can be convinced of the need to do something in this area? Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte, who has spoken so extensively of the real possibility for the fifteen Member States of the Union to increase jobs through a wise policy, a wise initiative by the European Union in this field. Just this afternoon we discussed the problem of workers suddenly unemployed and at this moment, instead, we have the hope of being able to solve these problems. Tourism is an activity that is purely and essentially the responsibility of the European Union. All European states are known throughout the world for being tourist attractions envied by everyone, including the United States of America, which we spoke about this afternoon in relation to the Indian issue. I would like to underline a point in the Viceconte report that I particularly approve and endorse and on which I would like our Assembly and the Commission to reflect before giving a favourable response. It is the point relating to tourism for senior citizens. Usually I see Commissioner Diamantopoulou tearing her hair out one by one, desperate because the elderly live too long, which causes problems in the field of pension payments. In this case, however, the fact that we live longer means that there are more elderly people. Unfortunately, not everyone, but many, travel the world to see the wonders that exist and to learn, to know more: the Italians to see what the English are like, the Greeks to see what the Turks are like, the French to see their Italian cousins.	it
"I find it unacceptable that, within the Committee on Fisheries, a European Commission official has dared to state publicly that the financial means offered by the Commission to certain scientific bodies allow their conclusions to be checked. I believe this to be a very serious distortion: it is obvious that the Commission cannot and must not arrogate to itself the right to influence the conclusions of scientific experts in order to be able to apply the policy it deems most appropriate in view of its own interests alone. As regards the reduction of the pressure exerted by fishing on the resource, it is important to emphasise the international nature of this obligation. Indeed, what would be the purpose of reducing our European fishing fleet if, at the same time, third countries were to continue to exert pressure on the fishery resource? It must be said, among other things, that the development of the globalisation of trade entails a considerable reduction in the effectiveness of controls and surveillance of fishing activities. Transhipments have become widespread and it is not uncommon for fisheries products from a Member State which, because the TAC has been exceeded, cannot be sold in the Union to be marketed as imported products or products from another Member State. The latter case is very common for companies whose capital has been provided by a Member State other than the flag State of the vessel (this is, in effect, a poorly disguised form of ""quota-hopping""). Food safety in the field of seafood also plays a fundamental role. It is necessary to preserve the positive image of seafood and prevent unhealthy foods from being marketed in the European Union. The Members of the Union for a Europe of the Nations Group will therefore vote against this report which fails to clarify the shortcomings of the Commission communication and which increases the constraints imposed on the fisheries sector by Natura 2000. The vote is closed. Adjournment of session I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned. Resumption of session I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament, adjourned on 2 March. Madam President, I am referring to an event that occurred after the last part-session, specifically a hearing of the Committee on Women's Rights: the good name of this Parliament was at risk when it was stated that there was a massive increase in prostitution in the Strasbourg area coinciding with the part-sessions. I strongly hope that the city authorities will be consulted to verify whether this is a criminal activity, including perhaps trafficking in women and forced prostitution. I think it is very urgent to clearly signal our concern to the public; the European Parliament cannot remain indifferent to the news circulating about what is supposedly happening on the sidelines of the plenary sessions. Thank you, Mrs Gröner. I would like to tell you that I too was truly shocked when I learned of this and that I immediately wrote to the Mayor of Strasbourg to have the matter shed light on. I fully agree with the observations you are making, so much so that I even anticipated your request. Of course, I will keep you informed of the response that Mrs. Ries will certainly send me."	it
I believe that the Council of the European Union has, over time, provided clear evidence that this is not its position. Decisions were taken with a great sense of responsibility by the Council. What happened in Helsinki is very clear. Our relations with the Republic of Cyprus in its process of accession to the European Union constitute an element that the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus themselves recognize as positive. We must not engage in, or attempt to engage in, second readings of our intentions. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you sincerely for this debate, which I found generally encouraging and which shows that this House broadly approves of the policy of the Member States and the Commission. I would, however, like to provide the clarifications that have been requested of me. Firstly, as regards headings 4 and 7, it is very simple: in Berlin, for the large Agenda 2000 package, a special heading was created, the famous heading 7, for the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and only for these countries. Malta, Cyprus and Turkey were not yet included. Our colleague Mr Schroedter described this as a lack of coherence. Perhaps you should ask the then President of the Council, who is not far from you, Madam, how this so-called lack of coherence came about. I was also somewhat involved in it. I do not believe so, but this decision was motivated by the fact that a special instrument was wanted for the states of Central and Eastern Europe, which do not face the same conditions as Cyprus and Malta in the accession process. I said that I understood the arguments put forward here and the Commission will endeavour to take these wishes into account, but, as this concerns Agenda 2000 and the financial perspective, we cannot act without amending the financial perspective. This has obviously not been possible so far. To be clear, if we move this from heading 4 to heading 7, there will be no impact on the overall balance of the budget. If we do that, heading 7 would increase proportionally to the decrease in heading 4. It is impossible to add it to heading 7 while leaving heading 4 as it is. Nor can Parliament spend money it does not have, unless it has a printing press in the cellar so that it can print euro notes! Now, as regards the peace process in Cyprus and the link with the accession negotiations, I would like to reiterate that the accession negotiations have always had a direct connection with this. The Commission and the Council have always strived to involve the two Cypriot communities in joint projects. As you know, this has not been successful so far, and I am asked whether there are any beginnings.	fr
But even fifty years later, we have not succeeded in preventing genocide. It is therefore essential that far more attention be paid to monitoring and conflict prevention. Monitoring the arms trade and better control of the media are essential in this regard. Human rights policy is also too selective. NATO's months-long bombing of Kosovo and the mediation efforts in the Middle East stand in sharp contrast to the international community's indifference to the conflicts in Africa. I cannot help but get the impression that, despite all the rhetoric, Africa is not at the top of the Portuguese Presidency's agenda when it comes to human rights. I deeply regret this. It is not without reason that Africans are given the impression that they are inferior citizens of the world. I would like to warn against a weakening of standards in assessing the human rights situation in Africa, which would view human rights violations there as inevitable. Above all, human rights policy is fragmented. We, both within the international community and in Europe, are failing to define a common strategy. Take Sudan, for example. The international community is sending contradictory signals to the country. Great Britain is reopening its embassy in Khartoum. Canada is inviting the Sudanese to peace talks. Europe is pressuring the rebels in the south to negotiate, while at the same time the Americans are isolating the regime and providing military support. More coordination is needed, more information sharing, and a more coherent approach that avoids pushing the boundaries. Only then can we consistently follow the founders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Mr. President, if we could solve problems with words, we could all pack our bags and go home. But unfortunately, even as we speak in the privacy of this House, human rights are being violated throughout the free world. Sometimes the more we speak—motions: words; treaties: words; conventions: words—the less we hear. If we are not careful, words will replace real action. Words in comprehensive and liberating documents become treaties and conventions, often presented as evidence of respect for and observance of human rights in a country. However, words alone, spoken, written, or signed, are not enough. Let us look at the signatories to conventions on human rights and the treatment of minorities and then compare how such minorities, groups, or individuals are treated. The result is shabby and shameful. Can anyone confidently claim that women are treated fairly and equally, that children have human rights, that people are not discriminated against on the basis of their religion, beliefs, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, opinions, political beliefs, etc.? Defamation of minorities in the press and other media reinforces discrimination. Even in the EU, citizens are still subjected to human rights violations, and here, too, our conventions are violated. Every day, misinformation and misinterpretations are used in the press to deny certain minorities equality before the law and to denigrate ethnic minorities. It can be said quite openly that a hierarchy of oppression has been created.	de
Mr President, first of all, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Solana on this 1 March, the day on which several structures related to European security and defense policy came into force. However, I wonder how he himself feels about this. The documents speak of good cooperation with the High Representative. You yourself just said that you spoke to them over lunch; indeed, it should be added that you did not speak to them, and that there is no good cooperation between you and the new structures. But aren't you suffering from the fact that you are not chairing them yourself and are not at the center of things? I—and I believe many others in this House—would like to see you as the driving force behind this matter and not risk being somewhat sidelined. The High Representative, Mr Solana, and Commissioner Patten have tried in recent months, including in discussions with the members of the North Atlantic Assembly, to establish a distinction between EU defense policy and NATO's. One actually gets the impression that both consider the Petersberg Tasks suitable for permanent inclusion in an EU defense policy. The treaties also point in this direction, but they also leave more room for a more general defense policy, one that is more in line with the old statements about integrating our policy into a European pillar. We would then speak about this European pillar within NATO. I actually hear less and less about that. I have the impression that the European Union has limited its ambitions to the Petersberg Tasks, with Mr. Patten then responsible for civilian affairs, including the rapidly deployable units of police and civil servants, about which he, quite rightly, spoke with great enthusiasm, and Mr. Solana for military resources and the deployment of the military. Both, and I take this for granted, naturally work together excellently. But isn't something more actually happening now? Isn't something currently underway where people say: In defense policy, NATO's role in collective defense is being emphasized very strongly? The European pillar, yes, it actually no longer functions as such. Europe is limiting itself to the Petersberg tasks. Is it our intention to proceed in this way? Furthermore, the integration of the Western European Union into the European Union is being discussed, but no longer about Article V, in which we are, of course, directly involved. Then the focus is on the larger defense tasks, not just Petersberg. Will that be deleted? At the same time, there is also general talk of increasing defense budgets. I think that's right, but this plea doesn't make a strict distinction between Petersberg tasks and larger collective defense tasks. I wonder how things are developing. What is the ultimate view of the two gentlemen? Should greater attention be paid to this issue at the intergovernmental conferences, or can it arise automatically from the treaties? I welcome the fact that an opening has emerged here with regard to defense policy.	de
Therefore, I believe that support for environmental actions through the LIFE financial instrument guarantees the promotion of Community policy in the environmental sector and contributes significantly to fulfilling the Community's mission to achieve a high level of environmental protection and improvement. Mr. President, I would like to begin my speech by congratulating Mrs. Lienemann on the great sensitivity she has shown toward the environment in the two reports we are debating this afternoon. The truth is that two minutes are not enough to address such an important topic. I therefore call on the Commissioner to take charge of a matter of this magnitude. For the past five years, I have been responsible for the Environment Committee in another institution which, being regional in nature, certainly does not have as broad a vision as this Parliament. The environmental situation is very, very serious. As the colleagues who spoke before me have already indicated, I would like to dwell once again on the economic problem and the financing of projects which, in my opinion, should be entirely public. Madam Commissioner, regarding funding, €613 million is inadequate. So is €850 million. At the end of last August, I participated in a meeting of the Committee on the Environment where there was even talk of €2 million, or 4,000 billion lire, for eliminating or at least reducing smoking problems. However, the environment is a much more serious problem, much more important than smoking. I assure you, Commissioner, that €850 million—provided this funding is actually granted—is not, in practice, sufficient to carry out any type of project. In many areas, parks have been built that represent a fundamentally important element of the LIFE programme. But these parks were built with limited financial means, lacking signage, and, ultimately, ineffective and useless. I therefore urge Parliament and the Commission to devote serious attention to this issue. (SV) Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the institutions have been discussing the proposed regulation for the third stage of the financial instrument for the environment, LIFE, since the beginning of 1999. I would once again like to thank the Committee on the Environment and Mrs. Lienemann for their good and constructive cooperation in this matter. As a result, I can confirm that the Commission approves, in full or in principle, nine of the fourteen amendments adopted in committee. The Commission particularly welcomes Amendments 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13, on committee procedures. In these cases, Parliament has taken into account the Commission's objections to the common position. In principle, the Commission also approves Amendment 4, which, however, must be incorporated elsewhere in the text. Regarding Amendments 5 and 6, I would like to emphasize that the project for the sustainable use of groundwater and surface water and the project to reduce pollution that contributes to the greenhouse effect are largely covered by LIFE.	es
I know that this directive may cause some problems, because during the debate we have talked about the different situations in the various countries of the European Union. What happens in the North is different from what happens in the South, and in turn different from what happens in other countries with desertification problems. I know that. However, there are some amendments intended to help the countries of the South, in particular Amendment No 43 which, referring to cost recovery, also requires that Member States, in their decision-making process, take account of local social and environmental conditions. There are also difficulties with regard to water transfers. In my country, I live in the north of Spain, there are big differences between the North and the South, and difficulties arise when it comes to transferring water from one place to another. However, Mrs Lienemann's report also states that the basins receiving water transfers must economize and control their own water resources. I am aware of the complexity of this report and the difficulties arising from the different realities of the countries, but we must succeed in obtaining a framework directive that prevents a repetition of what is happening now in the Danube, or what happened in Doñana. We cannot allow the poisoning of Europe's waters, Mr President, so we must prepare a directive that strengthens the political will of governments to conserve a resource, precious to all, such as water. Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report. As an Irish Member of the European Parliament, and therefore as someone who comes from a country that has extensive reserves of excellent water, I support the vast majority of the proposals contained in the directive. However, I would now like to focus on the points of disagreement between the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy of this Parliament and the Council, which has already adopted its common position on this matter. The Council considers that the objective of good status of surface waters should be achieved within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive, while the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy would like to bring forward this deadline to ten years. I see no reason why the Member States of the European Union could not implement the basic provisions of the directive as quickly as possible. I now turn to the amendments that will be tabled in Parliament tomorrow on the principle of recovery of costs for the use of water resources. In the common position, the Council states that the governments of the Union must take account of the principle of recovery of costs for the use of water resources, but does not include in the text of the common position any date for the application of this principle. Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by 2010, water pricing policies provide adequate incentives for efficient use of water. Furthermore, the implementation of this policy must be ensured through an adequate contribution from the various economic sectors, divided into industry, domestic and agriculture.	it
In addition to economic and employment policy, the policies of the European Union also include social policy. Until now, this policy has been restrictive both in its approach and in its instruments. However, under the influence of freedom of movement, the internal market, and the euro, labor markets are also becoming more integrated. This has unmistakable consequences for social protection, which is crucially based on labor. Cross-border workers, seconded workers, migrant workers, as well as job seekers, interns, and students, feel prevented from exercising their right to freedom of movement because there is neither coordination nor convergence at the level of social protection. A similar phenomenon can be seen in the area of tax law. To combat distortions of competition and prevent dumping, the Commission has developed a balanced strategy that strikes a balance between harmonization on the one hand and non-interference on the other. On the one hand, there are binding and enforceable directives for equal pay or supplementary pensions; on the other, there are programs designed to create incentives to combat discrimination and social exclusion. With a series of recommendations, reports, and communications, the Commission has taken a step closer to harmonization, particularly with the objectives it has set and with the establishment of a high-level group of officials. Since both proposals have already been approved by the Council, it is crucial to support this approach in order to then be able to assess in good time and with expertise whether, to what extent, and how social protection needs to be harmonized within the European Union. Enlargement, globalization, an aging population, individualization, and new family structures necessitate such harmonization. If we deny these shifts, we are effectively abandoning social protection. To the Eurosceptics and nationalists, I say that social protection exclusively within the borders of a Member State is not social and offers no protection. Reducing social protection for competitive reasons also harms social protection as a productive factor. Less social protection means lower purchasing power, worsening workers' health, and less happy workers. I would like to say to the super-Europeans that European social protection is neither feasible nor desirable. Member States differ considerably from one another in terms of resources, beneficiaries, income, benefits, etc. This makes leveling the playing field impossible. The approach taken by the Commission is understandable. It is to its advantage that it can create clarity, collect data, and exchange experiences in order to subsequently agree on objectives, establish solid benchmarks, and make recommendations. I welcome this view. I would like to encourage the Commission in this and hope that we will make further progress on this point in Lisbon. Mr President, I would like to join my predecessors in congratulating Mr Andersson on his excellent report. With great effort on behalf of Parliament, he has succeeded in building broad consensus on an issue that is a sensitive problem in every respect, not only in this Parliament but in practically every Member State. I also welcome the Commission's communication. We have had to wait a long time for this, but the wait has been worth it. It could become a milestone in the development of a European social security system, provided we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to shy away from the steps that need to be taken.	de
"Even the combination of resources from the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds has not achieved the desired success in all regions and countries. Since the declared goal of all politicians across Europe is to reduce unemployment, the critical question must be asked: is the current policy the right one, or would it not be more appropriate to strengthen the competitiveness of the regions through appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improved infrastructure, and raised training levels? Serious structural reforms and a competition-friendly tax and levy policy are the building blocks of a successful business location. If we do not want to be accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that achieves no lasting effect on employment, the measures taken so far must be re-examined. The Union's structural policy is successful when it succeeds in creating sufficient jobs and significantly reducing the unemployment rate. Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for addressing this very important issue. Ultimately, the development of the social and economic situation is crucial for how Europe's citizens assess the success of our work. The problems people face every day are crucial to the EU's credibility. We must admit that the EU has already supported the development of poorer countries – in my opinion, very generously. When I consider what Portugal and Greece looked like when I first visited these countries 25 years ago, I take my hat off to the EU, or, as the French say, a ""coup de chapeau."" The EU truly deserves this respect. Within the countries themselves, however, there are still too great disparities between poor and rich regions. What are the consequences? People react by voting with their feet and leaving their homes. So we have to build new schools, hospitals, and the entire infrastructure multiple times for the same people in the same country. This is a very expensive undertaking and also leads to major social problems. Most people, however, would like to remain where they were born if they had the opportunity—if they had a job. We must give them that opportunity. It's a moral duty that the EU and all of us have. I see one solution in significantly promoting entrepreneurship. By this, however, I don't just mean owning a business, but the will to run one. I mean an attitude that encourages people to advance in life, whether as employees, entrepreneurs, or civil servants. What does a just society look like? It is a society in which even someone from humble beginnings can advance so that their children have a somewhat easier life. This also opens up the possibility of positive regional development, because people are committed and work when the conditions are right. In conclusion, I would like to point out that in this respect we should learn from America, where hard work is still fashionable and success is a testament to competence and not a subject of envy, as is often the case here in Europe."	de
For this reason, we must reiterate time and again that these two products cannot be compared, apart from the fact that minimum protection is appropriate. Why don't we be guided by the minimum protection provided for in the Securities Transactions Directive, for example, by Article 11 thereof, which refers to good conduct? In my opinion, this is another step forward we could take, and I think it would also be good if consumers and investors could get an idea of the risk structure of the funds mentioned from their names. Mr. President, Commissioner, the proposed directive we are discussing entails several welcome reforms to current regulations. In the drafting process, a balance has largely been found that is conducive to increasing the efficiency and growth of financial markets, without skimping on adequate protection for consumers who participate in investment funds. The greater consumer confidence in the functioning of financial markets, the more consumers will choose to invest in open markets. The more consumers invest, the more promising European corporate financing markets will be. It is clear that if companies more easily receive equity financing, their balance sheets will have more solid foundations, and consequently, the possibilities for growth and investment will improve. In this context, it is irrelevant whether the increase in capital in the stock markets comes from direct private investment or from collective investment schemes. Although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we generally agreed on the objectives of the legislative reform, the drafting process in this parliamentary committee has not been the easiest. At least personally, I found the technical division of the directive into two different proposals difficult, a fact that did not in any way facilitate my familiarization with this difficult and highly specialized subject. In any case, I would like to express my opinion on some specific proposals. First of all, I am very pleased that the proposed directive, as a whole, increases the freedom of investment funds to channel financing capital into different instruments. Regarding derivatives, I believe that the position approved by the parliamentary committee is justified—unlike Ms. Ranzio-Plath, for example. Derivatives not traded on regulated markets, OTC derivatives, should not be treated differently in this directive than standardized derivatives, since OTC derivatives are commonly used in many Member States and have also been used in the past. Regarding Article 5(g) of the second proposal for a directive, that is, the so-called delegation article, I believe that the Commission's original proposal on the rules governing the granting of powers was better than the one now approved by the parliamentary committee, and I therefore support some of the amendments made by Ms. Villiers on this point. Mr. President, I see two problems with this morning's debate. First of all, when I came to this Parliament many years ago, I was told that when there's a difficult task, it's entrusted to a Liberal. Now I'm told that if there's a difficult debate, we know we'll have problems if half of Luxembourg's MEPs are in the Assembly at the same time—and they are.	es
Perhaps I will explain it differently from Professor Tsatsos and Elmar Brok, who are your direct representatives. In fact, it is likely that, in many cases, we will do it together. It is very important to me that the negotiations are not secret, neither from the European Parliament nor from the national parliaments which, I would remind you, will ultimately have to express an opinion and take a position in the ratification process. That is why I paid tribute to the initiative of the Honourable Member Napolitano in favour of joint and regular consultation between the national parliaments of the fifteen countries and the European Parliament. Having said that, the duty of transparency and debate begins here, on the subject of institutional reform. Therefore, throughout the current year I will be available whenever you wish to explain our positions and the progress of the negotiations. Mr President, first of all, my compliments on the approach chosen by the Commission. I think it is excellent that we are addressing the dialogue with citizens right from the start, because that is precisely what was missing in the Amsterdam Treaty and the Maastricht Treaty and which has generated a great deal of distrust. Two questions. First, you said that you want to establish a dialogue with citizens and will start with 700 trainees at the European Commission. I would like to know whether you intend to address citizens also through the mass media, that is, television and the Internet. My second question is quite critical. The European Commission has just presented a proposal on transparency which is not even a rough draft of the proposal on transparency of legislation that is being discussed in the Netherlands and this proposal has attracted a lot of criticism in the Netherlands. So I wonder how you intend to achieve transparency in relation to the IGC, given that the directive on the table now is certainly not a good example of this. Honourable Member, Minister Maij-Weggen, since we are talking about transparency in relation to the IGC, you know very well how you intend to proceed. The negotiations are starting right now. The representatives are meeting in Brussels and I will try to go there later. The documents will be mostly open, working documents in practice. We will not discuss in front of the media during the negotiating meetings that will take place throughout the year between the Ministers and the European Council, but I have undertaken, since I cannot do anything else at the moment, to practice transparency and to report, at the most appropriate instances, on the developments of the negotiations and the Commission's point of view. I thank you for having asked me on this point and I confirm that we intend to use all modern means, especially television, to rebroadcast our public debates in the various countries and even at a European level. We will set up a chat line on the Internet, we will set up permanent discussion forums. The Commissioners will undertake to answer all questions promptly. We will use all these modern means. But I believe that we must try to get as close as possible to the people. I would like - even if it is probably still a bit utopian - that in all the regions of Europe a Commissioner, a Member of the European Parliament, a Minister participates in public debates, when he can.	it
He has highlighted some interesting perspectives, some of which I would like to expand on in some detail. I consider it extremely important to reconsider the scope of the regulation. First, projects need to be more strongly geared toward restoring tropical forests. The 1995 Council Regulation was perhaps too exclusively focused on protecting tropical forests and did not sufficiently address the utilization of their productive potential. Furthermore, future Community actions must incorporate all aspects of sustainable forest management. This means taking into account the local populations that depend on forest ecosystems. It should not be overlooked that the necessary active participation of this vulnerable population faces major obstacles: the forest areas in question are often affected by unrest and conflict, as well as the negative impacts of tourism, which is all too often presented as a panacea. Furthermore, local forest laws, where they exist, are rarely enforced. While some forests have ceased to produce any kind of productive activity, there are also those that continue to serve an economic function. This applies to our forests in the European Union, and I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, what Community aid was provided for our European forests devastated by the storms last December? The objectives of this report are undoubtedly to be supported, but a genuine Community policy on the conservation and sustainable management of forests is also needed. I hardly need to stress how important tropical forests are for our planet, how great their influence on the climate is, how much of the world's biodiversity is found in these forests and how important they are, for example as a source of fuelwood, for the lives of millions of people in developing countries. For these and other reasons, European citizens rightly expect the Community to support measures for the conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests. Although I am referring to tropical forests, what is new about this regulation is that, compared with the previous regulation, its scope has been extended to all developing countries, so that it now includes countries such as South Africa and China, as well as the Mediterranean countries and the regions of the Middle East. The regulation explicitly refers to the needs of local communities and populations dependent on the forest ecosystem, as well as the need to take gender considerations into account. We spoke earlier about the Environment Regulation, but my comments on a number of horizontal issues also largely apply to the Regulation on measures to promote the conservation and sustainable management of tropical and other forests in developing countries. I will therefore only briefly refer to that regulation. With regard to the amendments listed in Mr Fernández Martín's report, the Commission's view on the main horizontal issues is as follows. Financial reference amount: The Commission accepts the compromise amount of EUR 249 million for the seven-year period, as set out in Amendment 9. Comitology: The Commission supports Amendment 11 in principle, but prefers the wording of Amendments 13, 14 and 15. The amendments propose a split in the comitology procedure, with annual guidelines and priorities being adopted through the management procedure, while the Council should examine individual measures with a value of more than EUR 2 million through the advisory procedure.	de
Parliament's refusal to grant discharge and the final rejection of the 1996 budget, the motion of censure presented to Parliament last year for various reasons, and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which led to the wholesale resignation of the Commission itself, are now part of European folklore. Those of us who took part in that historic event know very well that there would have been no upheaval if Parliament had not used its power to pressure the Commission to change its way of operating. Remember: the Council of Ministers, which is still absent from this debate tonight, approved the discharge for the financial year 1997, not 1996, on the very day the Commission resigned, 15 March. Now we have the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts, which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September. Our greatest concern in the EPP is to regain public trust. Any further steps towards building a strong Europe will be for nothing if the people of Europe feel that the system of democratic accountability is unsuitable for overzealous civil servants. We will not give up ground under any circumstances, ground we have gained in recent months and which, we believe, serves the interests of openness and transparency. We are therefore concerned by the flurry of Commission announcements launched by Commissioner Kinnock in recent weeks, suggesting that various types of policy proposals will soon be put into a White Paper. While this shows a desire to act quickly, it also gives the impression that the Commission is more in a transmitting mode than a listening one. Our concern will be heightened if the rumor of recent days is correct, namely, that the Commission intends to seriously limit Parliament's access to information. This issue was, after all, one of the causes of the previous Commission's downfall. Haven't the lessons been learned? The knowledge that the European Parliament and the European Commission still have to negotiate framework relations led us to disagree with the rapporteur when we discussed his report in committee. We could not in any way agree with him when he said that it would be humiliating for Parliament to give detailed instructions on what it wanted in the Commission's reform package. The less specific we are in our resolutions, Mr van Hulten, the more scope the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council will have to do as they please. We believe that the many recommendations in the Wise Men's report should be implemented. The PPE-DE Group submitted all the recommendations in the Wise Men's report to committee, and many of them are now included in the report, which has entirely changed the nature of the van Hulten report in committee. We have again proposed some amendments that had been rejected in committee, in particular, our wish for a revision of the codes of conduct, in particular with a view to including the reference to merit and management capacity that you, Commissioner, had agreed to include during the hearings last September in these codes of conduct, particularly in the context of appointments and promotions.	fr
First, I welcome Proposal No. 1. It simplifies things and brings them up to date. I believe many British Members will vote against a large number of the report's amendments. We support the Schmidt report on Proposal No. 1, but we regret that the directive sets a host of quantity limitations, which limit the ability to spread risks. We believe the best way forward is a more liberal market. Second, we find Proposal No. 2 very confusing. It is difficult to understand, and we believe the Commission would be wise to revisit it. If more regulation is needed, we believe this could be better achieved through means other than those proposed in the directive. In particular, we disagree with the proposal on capital requirements because if the requirements are too high, they could mean that some companies would have to leave the sector. We ask the Commission to revisit these proposals. Finally, we would like to urge Members to vote against Amendment 41, particularly regarding capital requirements, because we believe that it would be very detrimental to the sector. Mr. President, pecunia non olet, as the Latins used to say. The important thing is that money generates more money. This is the only occasion on which we bring together the interests of economists and those who want to get rich and only think of dollars, like Uncle Scrooge, who has a dollar sign drawn instead of eyes, only in this case the symbol is the euro. Here we bring together the interests of those citizens and the interests of pensioners who wish to live a quiet life. For example, my brother-in-law, who lives in Rome, has been a pensioner for a year, and since then, every day—from seven in the morning when he wakes up until midnight—he monitors the progress of his investments in pension funds and securities on a screen. In the future, pensioners will have access to huge amounts of money—as they already do now. Indeed, while young people are penniless, older people have accumulated money, and since they want to make it profitable, they are very interested in this directive. If national governments had a heart—as the European Union does in this directive—in multiplying the money earned throughout one's working life, the problem of the pension bomb would have already been solved. You, Mr. Bolkestein, as Commissioner, have a huge responsibility for the future of older people and pensioners, a future that I hope will be better once we have finalized this directive, that is, very soon, as Mrs. Villiers and Mrs. Kauppi propose. (NL) Mr. President, with your permission, I would like to begin by thanking rapporteur Olle Schmidt and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the committee responsible, as well as rapporteur Brian Crowley and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, whom I would like to thank for their intensive and important efforts in refining and expanding the proposals.	es
"Opinion of a Southern European MP: ""Nevertheless, that's what competitiveness and equality of conditions are all about."" (End of fiction). The MP who is now explaining his vote considers it positive that there is a Community directive on water, but he believes that with environmental dogmatisms we are not building Europe, we are creating a legislative caricature. We cannot treat countries affected by floods and drought, such as the Mediterranean countries, in the same way as countries subject to a northern rainfall regime. In a completely different order of things, Europe would be disunited if in the future it made water transfers between different basins impossible. Once again, we must remember that we are involved in a continental project of political union. Drinking, eating, washing, farming...: water irrigates every act of our daily lives. Water wrongly considered an unalterable and inexhaustible resource. Because an action as simple as turning on a tap seems self-evident. But the source threatens to dry up... All scientific studies are now clear: water will be the key issue in the coming years, starting tomorrow. But tomorrow will be too late. It is time today to clarify the rules of the game, before we all lose. By adopting the Water Directive on Wednesday, February 15, the European Parliament affirmed its ambition to protect surface water, coastal water, inland water, and groundwater. Europe now has a framework to prevent any deterioration in water quality, promote its sustainable use, protect ecosystems, help combat floods and droughts, and eliminate the discharge of hazardous substances. It is a lifeline thrown to the water. It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a Water Framework Directive. Indeed, the ecological disaster on the banks of the Danube reminds us, if one were needed, that too often human negligence leads to the endangerment of natural resources, such as water. The objective of this proposal for a directive, which dates back to 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation that has characterized water legislation to date and to protect surface water, coastal water, inland water and groundwater. It provides a framework to prevent further deterioration, protect ecosystems, promote sustainable water use, help combat floods and droughts and phase out the discharge of hazardous substances. Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework. The procedure for drafting this text was lengthy. The proposal for a directive was amended twice, once in 1997 and again in 1998. A technical working group composed of representatives of the Council and Parliament met in January 1999 to try to reconcile the positions of our two institutions. However, the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment remain numerous. I support most of them. As regards the timetable and objectives, the Council foresees that the objective of achieving good surface water status should be achieved no later than 16 years after the entry into force of the directive; the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy would like this deadline to be reduced to 10 years."	fr
"The report does not say - but it will have to in the future - that the governments of the last forty years in all the Member States have squandered and wasted the capital that workers had entrusted to them to pay their pensions. Today, the coffers are empty. The whole system must be changed! These governments must resign because they deserve no one's trust, neither the elderly nor the young people of today, nor the pensioners of 2100, 2200, etc. I will begin by warmly congratulating the rapporteur on the audacity of his proposals! I will continue by deploring the timidity of the right wing of this European Parliament which, by adopting a whole series of amendments, has emptied the work of my colleague of its substance! This report is, I remind you, based on the Commission's annual economic report for 1999, the first published under the euro regime. It therefore concerns the unified European economy rather than a series of national economies. The European Parliament wanted to take this opportunity to make imaginative and ""activist"" proposals, to use the adjective used by the rapporteur, with a view to giving a new direction to the economic activities of the European Union. Indeed, one thing is clear: Europe has an incomparable potential for economic and social progress which, for reasons that are still partly beyond us, remains largely unexploited, hence the very interesting suggestions contained in the initial report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to revive economic activity by setting ambitious targets (75% employment rate, resumption of growth, etc.) and by equipping itself with the means to achieve them! The initial proposals notably invited the Council to adopt measures aimed at ensuring full employment while remaining consistent with price stability and budgetary balance throughout the economic cycle. Indeed, this is not, as some would have us believe, a question of calling into question the stability policy adopted in recent years. Measures, particularly fiscal ones, encouraging private and public investment must be adopted. The trans-European networks programme as proposed in 1994 must be put back on track, and a vast research and development programme launched to give investments the necessary innovative content. How can it be considered that investment should not serve as an instrument for managing demand but be carried out on its own merits? We must promote better management of working time and the generalisation of good practice policies in the Member States in order to increase the degree of employability, particularly among the most disadvantaged sections of the working population. Certain measures such as requalification, in the form of lifelong training, are particularly relevant. They should be an integral part of the ongoing institutional transformation that must accompany the transition to a knowledge-based economy."	fr
Secondly, there are Community directives, but they are not applied or are applied only to a limited extent because there are not enough national inspectors. This must be remedied urgently. A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but progress is very slow. In this regard, there is unacceptable inflexibility and inaction on the part of the Commission. The deadline for presenting the Commission's communication on this crucial issue, which has been constantly postponed and is now set for July, must be brought forward. The basic provisions must be particularly clear and strict. Let me mention just three aspects that our group considers a priority. Firstly, the liability of cargo owners for oil cargoes must be clearly defined so that victims of pollution can invoke it unequivocally. The best precaution for the future is for charterers to be certain that they will face severe civil, criminal, and financial liability if they are not extremely vigilant with regard to the safety of the ships they choose to use. Secondly, the requirement that oil tankers authorized to operate in Community waters must have a double hull must be adopted as soon as possible and not postponed indefinitely. Thirdly, an age limit for ships authorized to operate in Community waters must be set immediately. This could be set at a maximum of 15 years. If it is not possible to adopt a sufficiently clear, strict, and consistent Community regulatory framework, Member States that wish to create their own framework of this kind should be entitled to do so in order to protect their populations and their territory, just as the United States learned the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by requiring double hulls and barring all ships over 20 years old from entering its waters. This is why the United States banned the Erika from entering its waters. Had the Community done the same, a huge disaster would have been avoided. Let us truly learn the lessons this time, Mr. President, Commissioner, even if the emotions of the media and Parliament have subsided. Mr. President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic Bravery, Haven, Amoco Cadiz, Gino, Tanio—all these names evoke ominous memories. And now Erika. Which tanker is next? Twenty-one years after the Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth oil spill, the seventh since 1967, demonstrates the irresponsibility of our respective governments. Once again, our west coast on the Atlantic is paying the high price for their inability to react, for their capitulation to the multinationals. It is difficult to understand why the French and Europeans allow what the Americans prohibit, and why Europe, which is usually so quick to act with environmental legislation, has ignored maritime safety. Now we have the result. The Erika, a Maltese-flagged ship, a floating wreck considered one of the most dangerous tankers, has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline, a pollution far more severe than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz. As a member of parliament from the Loire-Atlantique region, I can unfortunately attest to this.	de
"He has just lectured the Socialist Group because it is going back on a decision that was taken extremely clearly in the Conference of Presidents. However, he is doing the same thing. We discussed it, we were unanimous except for the EPP Group and the Liberal Group and I even pointed out, you will remember this, my dear fellow Presidents, that the question is not whether you are for or against the Tobin tax, but whether you dare to hear what the Commission and the Council think about it. That is not asking much. Therefore, I reiterate the proposal to maintain this oral question to the Commission and the Council to find out once and for all the position of these two bodies with regard to this relatively modest proposal, which would nevertheless send an important signal to public opinion, particularly after the emotion aroused by the failure of the Seattle conference. We are going to vote on the request of the EPP-ED Group to remove the oral question concerning the capital tax from the agenda. (Parliament rejects the request with 164 votes in favour, 166 against and 7 abstentions) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for the publicity he has just given to this debate. Thank you. Madam President, has my vote been counted, as it could not be cast electronically because I do not have my card? I voted ""for"". Indeed, if we add the two colleagues who expressed their views, we get the following result: Madam President, the Chair has announced the result of the vote. There are no grounds for amendments. Madam President, during the last vote - and I defer to your decision on this matter - on the question of the Commission's strategic plan, I indicated that I was requesting the floor before the vote on behalf of my group. However, my request was not granted. I would be grateful, at the end of this agenda item, if you would allow me to provide an explanation of vote on behalf of my group. This is important. It would be useful to record in the Minutes of Parliament how people perceive what we have just done, in the light of their own political analysis. Madam President, I do not want to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor to express my views on Mr Barón Crespo's request. You did not give me the floor either. I regret this, but the vote has been taken, the decision has been made, and we should therefore leave it at that. I am sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox, I did not see that you had asked for the floor. That being said, I believe the positions are quite clear and they will be recorded in the Minutes. When we adopt the minutes of today's meeting tomorrow, colleagues who feel that the positions have not been explained sufficiently well will be able to request amendments."	fr
Mrs Palacio spoke at length on this issue, and I believe that, with a proposal for a directive on the maritime transport of dangerous goods, she has immediately initiated what is absolutely necessary today: the approach to European maritime law. In this regard, she will be able to see that France is prepared, during its Presidency, to work towards regulations that contribute to greater safety. But after the ecological shock, the economic shock, to which many Members have already referred, is becoming apparent. Shellfish farming, fishing, oyster farming, and fish farming are now seriously affected. In addition to the oil spill, storm damage has also been added to many areas. These industries have unfortunately suffered exceptional damage. They must, on the one hand, repair the damage and, on the other hand—perhaps even more difficult—regain customer confidence. Faced with this situation, the people of Brittany—in the Vendée and Charente departments—and forestry companies in other regions—are waiting for a sign from the European Union. We cannot simultaneously dedicate this legislative period to bringing people closer together and remain passive and lacking concrete responses in the face of disasters of this nature and magnitude. I listened with great attention to Commissioner Fischler's words, which are perhaps the most concrete we have heard to date. There have undoubtedly been numerous expressions of sympathy, solidarity, and announcements, but today it is time for the waiting to be followed by a concrete sign of European solidarity. The oil spill from the Erika shipwreck is just one in a long series of disasters in Community waters in recent years, including the oil spills from the Braer off Scotland and the Sea Empress off the Shetland Islands. These spills have not only caused irreparable ecological damage, they have also had devastating effects on local industries. The Erika wreck has caused serious damage to the local fishing and aquaculture sectors, and in addition to the damage visible today, the long-term consequences of oil pollution must not be ignored. There must be effective compensation. Community shipping safety rules must be tightened, controls must be tightened, and sailing under flags of convenience, which is also increasingly evident in the fishing sector, must be stopped. Shipowners and cargo owners bear responsibility and must be held accountable for their negligence. Existing compensation funds are inadequate, as was clearly demonstrated by the Braer accident, in which the Shetland fishing sector was not adequately compensated for its losses. We must learn from the past and ensure that the sectors damaged by the Erika oil spill can be rebuilt. Mr President, it is necessary that we revisit this disaster today, two and a half months after the Erika accident, because its dramatic consequences are far from over. Today, in conjunction with the organised victims, we must maintain the pressure to ensure that Total pays for all the damage caused by its unbridled pursuit of profit, while at the same time taking decisive action to prevent such disasters from happening again.	de
"I am referring, for example, to the restructuring of the ABB-Alsthom Power company, where a large delegation of employees from all over Europe is in Strasbourg today. The management of ABB-Alsthom Power, which is the result of a merger carried out in June 1999, has already announced a restructuring with the prospect of job cuts in several countries. This disastrous employment situation raises numerous questions, particularly about the information provided to the European Works Council, which has existed since 1996. It calls for an update and strengthening of the Community directive on European Works Councils. It also calls for merger control that takes into account employment, the environment, and consumers. The report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is insufficient from this perspective, which is why I abstained. By seeking to apply the principle of subsidiarity at the level of Community competition policy, the Commission delegates to national authorities and courts jurisdiction over decisions and abuses of dominant positions in relation to agreements between companies that create market distortions, although issues of corporate concentration and State aid remain under the notification regime. The position now adopted is aimed at creating more expeditious and less costly forms of competition policy enforcement, with Community law now being applied at the level of national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice, and there is even talk of the possibility of specialized courts. This partial renationalization of competition policy could entail greater costs for Member States. Furthermore, as the rapporteur points out, public monopolies have often been replaced by private monopolies in the name of competition policy, with the privatization of important public sectors and companies, as has occurred in Portugal, with negative consequences for the country and for its workers. (FR) The Commission's White Paper on the modernization of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (new Articles 81 and 82) certainly does not propose a ""renationalization"" of competition policy, as some in the European Parliament fear. But it does, in any case, suggest some rather interesting possibilities for development for the European Union. Indeed, having noted the bottleneck in its services due to advance notifications of corporate agreements that could distort trade and fearing that their number will continue to grow with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission proposes the abolition of the prior authorization regime for these agreements and a more decentralized application of competition rules at the Member State level. The most remarkable thing, in my opinion, is the signal this proposal sends: the Commission anticipates the consequences of enlargement and understands that this necessarily and almost mechanically entails a reform of the centralized system. It is clear that, in this case, the reform consists of promoting flexibility, not dismantling it. On paper, the Commission is expected to retain central control and direction of the new system. Moreover, the von Wogau report, which the European Parliament has just approved, encourages it in this direction."	es
"The European Union's water policy does not start from scratch. Numerous directives have been adopted, and the Commission is committed to making them more legible, more compatible with each other, and with clearer objectives. Thus, a desire for rationality has led to the formulation of this framework directive. But our Parliament, at first reading, insisted that the current directive not only be compatible with the commitments we have made—like OSPAR—but also allow us to reverse course. Despite these numerous directives, despite frequent declarations about the efforts that must be made to protect water, when we examine the state of the environment in Europe, we see that the objectives have not been achieved. In many cases, the situation has deteriorated, and therefore, we cannot be content with an effort to rationalize the texts. We must set objectives that match the imperatives we face, and we don't have much time. Because if we do so, as the Commission proposed, with excessively long deadlines, when the Commission and the Council have once again extended the deadlines, not only will we have a credibility problem with public opinion, but, in addition, efforts—as we know full well—will be left for tomorrow, and tomorrow they will be postponed again, and therefore the desired objectives will not be achieved. I insist on this point, because we shouldn't wait for the umpteenth time until catastrophes are reported every day in our newspapers to say: ""Ah! Europe didn't act. Ah! Europe should have acted!"" and then, in haste, pretend we are going to solve the problems we didn't want to tackle head-on in a timely manner. Today's example of the Danube, of the pollution occurring in Romania, shows very clearly that if we do not implement a new approach to economic development, clear requirements, controls, and precise measures regarding the state of our rivers, not only will these types of incidents be repeated—we know this—but they will also multiply over time. We also know that if we do nothing, the development of our agriculture will continue to be carried out with major imbalances. Already, the Breton rivers in my own country are in a state of eutrophication, which is damaging to tourism. I would simply like to conclude, Mr. President, by saying that the imperatives are clear at second reading. Do we want, yes or no, standards compatible with OSPAR, that is, approaching zero in the case of hazardous substances? Do we want to reduce the timeframes that the Council has proposed for this directive? Do we want a pricing policy that gives all public and private actors the ability to decontaminate, to act against pollution, and economize our water? Do we seriously want to respond to the aspirations of our people? Most of the amendments voted on by the Environment Committee respond to that objective; I hope they will gain the support of the House. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Lienemann has just forcefully explained the importance of water and air to us, especially as the simply essential foundation of human life."	es
In particular, as agreed in the Human Rights Council on 9 February 2000, the European Union intends to table motions for resolutions on the territories occupied by Israel, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burma/Myanmar, a proposal for a Presidency statement on Colombia and, if possible, East Timor, as well as a proposal for a statement on the situation in the various countries. The European Union will continue the discussion on the preparation of the 56th session of the Commission on Human Rights at the next meeting of the Human Rights Working Party in March. In particular, the question of the possible presentation of a motion for a resolution on the death penalty will be discussed. The Working Party has so far failed to agree on the strategy to be used in addressing this issue and, in particular, on the wording of the commitment to be given as a last resort in response to any changes to the contrary, including Article 2(7) of the UN Charter, which refers to the question of sovereignty. An attempt was made to reach a preliminary consensus on a compromise text, given the difficulties that arose at the 1999 session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, where the positions of the Member States diverged on an amendment introducing a reference to paragraph 7 of Article 2 in the draft resolution sponsored by the European Union on the death penalty. Last year, at the 55th session of the Commission on Human Rights, as is well known, the United States decided, at a very advanced stage, to table a draft resolution on China. This draft resolution was rejected on the basis of a Chinese motion for non-interference. The European Union voted against this motion. The position of the European Union on the attitude to be taken towards China in the Commission on Human Rights was reconfirmed by the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: no initiative by the European Union with regard to China, no support for a resolution on China, vote by the European Union against the motion of non-interference. It is not certain whether the cohesion of the European Union could have been maintained if the resolution had been put to the vote. The United States of America will present a motion for a resolution on China at the 56th session of the Commission on Human Rights and is pressuring the European Union to sign this motion. This has provoked strong reactions from China: the Chinese authorities are urging the countries and institutions of the European Union to refrain from supporting the initiative of the United States of America. The initiative is being discussed within the Union, but a decision is not expected in the near future. It is in the interest of the European Union to keep open, as far as possible and in any case until the end of the meeting to be held on 25 February 2000, all options in the dialogue between the European Union and China on human rights. In the light of the changes which have occurred in the composition of the Commission on Human Rights, it is expected that the outcome of the vote on the motion of non-interference will be very uncertain. It is therefore important that this year too the countries of the European Union reach a consensus on the position to be taken with regard to the possible vote on the resolution.	it
Perhaps Commissioner Kinnock could give us a preview this evening? Mr Van Hulten, my group of environmentalists and regionalists will shortly be supporting the attempts to further improve the report in the plenary session tomorrow afternoon. It makes no sense to repeat word for word the many valid recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts. Therefore, if we vote against certain amendments or paragraphs tomorrow, it will certainly not be because we are against the content of the text. Our aim is to make your report easier to read. In any case, it must be clear that my group fully supports the recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts. I am, however, looking forward to seeing the document adopted by the Commission today and the White Paper that will be published in February. However, I must tell you, Commissioner, that both the Wise Men's report and the Van Hulten report will become important points of reference for our group, enabling us to confirm or deny our confidence in the Prodi Commission. Allow me one final comment. We are calling for the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission to be given the same treatment as the one on food safety, which was published last week and made accessible to the public and which has set a concrete deadline. I believe this is a necessary step because public opinion is expecting a change. My group, in any case, is calling for real change to materialise by the end of 2002. Mr President, this report is certainly timely, but it is not enough on its own. Fraud, mismanagement and nepotism are not random phenomena. They are more likely to take hold where democratic control over finances is limited. A large part of the European budget is distributed through the Structural Funds. This only makes sense if it is based on solidarity, when rich countries help to create income and development in poorer countries. The funds thus distributed find their way back to the rich countries via Brussels. Municipalities and regional authorities consider these funds to be their property, but they can only regain possession of them by investing massive financial and human resources in lobbying and negotiation. With every misuse of European funds, and certainly after every fraud, the call for even stricter controls echoes. However, even the strictest controls cannot solve the problem. The only result would be an increase in bureaucracy and a reduced possibility for local democracies and citizens to influence and participate in the choices regarding the various projects and their implementation. It would be more appropriate for these funds to be transferred directly from national governments to local authorities without going through Brussels. In the coming years, we will have to think about the possibility of replacing the Structural Funds with an equalisation fund used exclusively to support the budgets of Member States or regions with low per capita income. This is perhaps the only way to contain fraud and administrative costs and to strengthen transparency and democracy.	it
A Europe that ensures social justice is a requirement that has lost none of its relevance, since achieving it means first and foremost placing the fight against mass unemployment and poverty at the centre of Union policy in a targeted manner. For these reasons, the realisation of this political vision also presupposes, in my opinion, the courage to amend Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union, which describes the European Union, according to a classical-neoliberal approach, as an open market economy with free competition. In this same political vision, an important role, in my opinion, belongs to Article 105 of the same Treaty, since the European Central Bank must finally receive the political mandate, provided for by the Treaty, to promote sustainable growth and employment through its monetary policy. Mr President, the Union for a Europe of the Nations Group believes that the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference must be respected as defined by the Helsinki Council, that is to say strictly focused on issues relating to the decision-making process of the enlarged Europe. This agenda must be respected precisely to ensure that, before enlargement, the work of the Conference is carried out effectively and rapidly. We cannot therefore associate ourselves with the opinion of the European Parliament, much less with that of the Commission, as they are aimed at excessively extending the agenda in a negative sense, that is to say in the sense of centralisation and the ever more tight closure of the European system. My group has therefore tabled a series of amendments which, put together piece by piece, form a genuine alternative resolution. We affirm that the next IGC must work towards a decision-making system that is more respectful of national sovereignty. We regret that the Commission, in its opinion of 26 January, persists in continuing in the usual direction towards a uniform Europe that extends to the East, a centralised superstate that functions by majority decisions. Federalists may believe that in this way unity can be created by force, but this idea is completely naive. On the contrary, in an enlarged Europe, Mr President, forced uniformity through the abusive use of majority decisions can only lead to explosion. Furthermore, the centralised European system, as it is developing and clearly taking shape, weakens the nations and thus undermines the national patriotism that is the vital centre of our will to defend ourselves. The Europe that emerges from this cannot be stronger, but only weaker, because it no longer recognises its own identity and the causes it defends. This is why we have always said that enlargement was only possible by clearly guaranteeing the diversity and freedom of the peoples that make up Europe, or by adopting a variable geometry based on respect for national sovereignty. We are pleased to see this idea progress in areas that fortunately still fall outside the competences of the European Parliament and the Commission. The Europe of variable geometry is the Europe that respects national democracies and is based on nations, on national patriotisms and does not persecute them. It is in this Europe that we will find the will to defend ourselves against external threats and not in the binding and overly complex decision-making procedures that the Commission intends to propose during the next Intergovernmental Conference.	it
And when one considers that a conference will soon be held in Moscow, the somewhat pathetic state of the European Union's presence in this process becomes evident. I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that it must play a greater role, that it is time to take over and assume a greater presence of the European Union in this matter. I hope that the upcoming visit of the President of the European Parliament to the region, as well as that of the chairs of the corresponding interparliamentary delegations, will allow us to begin a phase of greater initiative and greater presence of the European Union in this complicated and difficult peace process. Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I would like to express my congratulations on your presentations, especially to Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share. Therefore, I will not repeat anything he has already said. I only want to make three observations that may be considered similarly by Commissioner Patten, but which, for various reasons, have not been able to be formulated as openly as some Members have done. First of all, I think we can welcome the agreements reached between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority. But we already have enough agreements: Oslo, Wye Plantation, Sharm el-Sheikh. Enough with the agreements; what we need to do now is fulfill them. I share my colleague Salafranca's skepticism when he says that this week there is bad news from Israel, since this latest agreement will not be fulfilled within the planned timeframe. The second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel. I find this very encouraging news. But this week we learned that Mr. Barak will not be going to Washington, so the negotiations cannot continue. I want to state very clearly that if the Golan Heights are returned to Syria, the problem in that region will be resolved. Regarding the issue of the referendum, which several colleagues have mentioned, we must reconsider whether a referendum must always be held to fulfill the obligations arising from international law. In Germany, they would probably be very happy if it were announced that a referendum was going to be held on payments to the European Union and that those payments would depend on what the German people were willing to pay. It would be a similar situation. The third and final point: the role of the European Union. I would like to highlight the extraordinary role played by the special envoy to this region, Mr. Moratinos, as well as the funding we have provided there, Commissioner Patten. You know that you will always find support in this Parliament, also for your proposal. We will be present when funding is to be provided. But we must also play a political role, and this role cannot be played by Mr. Moratinos alone in this region. The Council Presidency must act here, and Mr. CFSP must travel to the region. And we, just as the Russians did, must invite the key players in the peace process. Then we will play the role that corresponds to our participation and contribution.	es
When it comes to safety, my group will always support initiatives that increase transport safety. As recent events have shown, we still have a lot to do on this issue. Madam President, I would like to make a few remarks. First, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his extraordinarily precise and technical work on this report, and second, I would like to thank the Commission for the proposal it has submitted. It concerns the harmonization of examination requirements, but we are actually talking about minimum requirements. This is a shame in a way. The importance of road, rail, and inland waterway transport safety is naturally very great, and given the international nature of transport, the training of safety advisers should be harmonized, as should, for example, the requirements for the future ADR. That is important, but so is monitoring, and there are, of course, several reasons why we must devote special attention to it. Look at the road accidents of recent years. For example, in Belgium, the Netherlands, and some other countries, trucks carrying dangerous goods continued en route due to fog when they should have stopped. Or ships from Eastern Europe docked next to other vessels, creating a highly dangerous situation. Furthermore, research conducted in ports in Belgium, Finland, and also Japan shows that 50% of containers with partially dangerous goods are not properly delivered. In other words, this is of great importance. When looking at the situation of safety advisors, we see that in some countries, companies have been required to have such advisors since January 1 of this year. This currently creates major control problems, especially for small companies, because they cannot afford it. They will either reject these goods or mix them with other goods, and this will cause certain problems. Therefore, an evaluation of these activities is being requested in the form of annual reports and company analyses, which could eventually be incorporated into ISO 9002 certifications. The rules are in place; now comes the control. Let me mention one last point. Regarding control, we must reach sound agreements with the Eastern European countries, because they will not participate in the treaties on this matter until 1 July 2001, or for a year and a half from now. This gives them a temporary competitive advantage. This is not serious in itself, but what we should especially do is prioritize safety aspects in the transport of goods by road, rail, and inland waterway and incorporate this part of the Community acquis as quickly as possible and present it to the candidate countries. Madam President, in this Parliament, attention is rightly regularly drawn to the importance of transport safety. The increasing quantities of goods passing through Europe entail risks of which we are aware, and sometimes unconscious, for personnel and for the social environment.	es
"Mr. President, ""The European Union's development cooperation is in a pitifully bad state."" This was stated in a newspaper article published last week on the Union's development policy. This assessment is not new. Ever since we in Europe began engaging with development cooperation, its effectiveness and quality have been questioned. Hopes for improvement threaten to fade if the Commission continues to refuse to look in the mirror. Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not published? An important conclusion of this report concerned the inherent inconsistency of European policy. Especially in the areas of trade and agriculture, European policy is at odds with development policy. We are failing to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries. This is due to the differing views on development cooperation in the individual countries of the Union. We must no longer view development and cooperation as an instrument of foreign relations; instead, they must be evaluated as an independent policy area. I advocate for a transparent, solidarity-based, and efficient development policy. As long as the European approach to development issues tends to be inefficient and wasteful, it is advisable to give the Member States a greater role. Finally, I would like to call on the Commission to forward the aforementioned document to the European Parliament as soon as possible so that we too can consider possible solutions constructively. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I consider this initiative to be appropriate and entirely sensible. As several colleagues have already pointed out, we repeatedly encounter situations in which there is a major contradiction between what we want to achieve with development and cooperation policies and what we undo with other sectoral policies that pursue opposing interests in the development of the same countries. We are not just talking about the concrete impact of our joint measures on tourism, the environment, agriculture, fisheries, and industry. We are talking more generally—and this is the worst of it—about the contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defense policies. Ultimately, there are a whole series of contradictory situations. In my view, the contradictions are not quite as pronounced in the area of Community policies. However, they are more pronounced with regard to certain objectives and industries in some Member States. We must be aware of this. On the one hand, we often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world, as recently happened in Indonesia, a blatant case. Then again, we find that some European countries have supplied them with weapons and military equipment. These, in my view, are the most serious contradictions in this entire area; they are more serious than those arising from a certain incompatibility between sectoral policies, which also exist. Of course, we know that even within a given country there are always contradictions between several policies. That is normal. At the level of the European Union, we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between individual Community policies, in this case in development policy. We must be aware that these contradictions exist and that we must reduce them as much as possible."	de
"The European Union underlined its full support for the United Nations' efforts regarding the need for a tribunal to try former Khmer Rouge leaders. At the same time, we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties. I am heartened by the optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, about the prospects for an agreement on the proposed tribunal. The Committee will continue to raise issues relating to the rule of law, democratic principles, and human rights with the Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement, which entered into force on November 1 of last year. It has been very useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days. I hope we will have other opportunities, but I trust that in the coming years we will see fewer examples of their abuse. Thank you very much, Mr. Patten. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 6:00 p.m. Environmental disaster in the waters of the Danube The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: B5-0164/2000 by Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, B5-0167/2000 by Mr Maaten and Mr Thors, on behalf of the Liberal, Democrat and Reformist Group, B5-0168/2000 by Mr Oostlander and Mr Grossetête, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, B5-0173/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sjöstedt, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, B5-0179/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others, on behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group, on the environmental catastrophe caused by the spill of cyanide from a Romanian gold mine into the waters of the Lapus, Somes, Tisza, and Danube rivers. Mr. President, this week we debated the Water Framework Directive. The catastrophe that has occurred in Romania demonstrates once again how seriously we need to take water protection. This catastrophe has brought to the fore several important issues that affect us as the European Union. We welcome the European Union's commitment to providing assistance in decontaminating rivers. It is equally important to raise environmental awareness, both in Romania and in Central and Eastern Europe in general. We are therefore pleased that Commissioner Wallström has rushed to visit the region, as her visit can contribute to raising that awareness. After all, this is a candidate country for accession, and this catastrophe adds to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will be able to assimilate EU environmental regulations in time. Polluters must pay. I wonder if the European Union can pass this kind of cost on to the environmental ""cowboys"" demonstrating in the so-called ""Wild East,"" benefiting from those countries' lax environmental legislation. I would be in favor of that option. Mr. President, Commissioner, not every day is the same, but ecological disasters, unfortunately, are all the same. There is reason to be troubled, once again, by this serious pollution that is currently affecting Europe's fourth-largest wetland. The Danube Delta is in danger."	es
Likewise, we must continue to provide our assistance for economic reforms and social development in Lebanon as a whole. A solution must be found to the problem of the Palestinian refugees. This is the largest refugee group in the world, numbering almost five million, a sign of the formidable challenges we face. We must promote initiatives that increase the availability and improve the distribution and management of the region's very scarce water resources. Finally, although this is perhaps a matter of fundamental importance, we are promoting closer regional cooperation in various areas, bringing together all the countries concerned in a common effort to address common problems. It has already become clear that the financial resources currently available for Community aid to this part of the world will not be sufficient to meet the amount of aid that will be required in the event of permanent peace. I wish to emphasize this point. I wish to remind the Council again, and, if necessary, Parliament, that we must not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing. I repeat that a change in Middle East policy will require a change of pace in the support we are asked and expected to provide. I wish to add that we will want to provide it. In recent months and weeks, we have made progress, as Mr. Gama has pointed out earlier. But, inevitably, it will be a difficult process marked by difficulties and disappointments. We will do everything possible to contribute to bringing the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will arise from such an outcome. Finally, I will repeat for those who have entered the room in the last few minutes what I said at the beginning of my speech: that I will not be able to remain here until the end of the debate, largely because I assumed the debate would take place this morning, as I have scheduled a meeting on the Balkans for this afternoon. I hope for Parliament's understanding. Mr. President, Commissioner Patten has our understanding. I would like to tell you that communications with Madrid are usually more fluid, and I therefore hope to see you there soon. The statements we have heard throughout the day on the Middle East peace process are very timely given the busy tour that the Minister, Mr. Gama—I also regret his absence from the debate—made in the region, accompanied by other Council representatives. The tone of the media reports on the latest developments in the region could lead us to form a pessimistic view of the situation. I honestly believe that such an assessment would not reflect the reality of the facts. In this regard, I share Commissioner Patten's positive outlook. Let me explain: it is true that the Israeli government has postponed the third transfer of the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority.	es
The Commission's communication recommends a greater exchange of experiences, as well as the establishment of a high-level group and benchmarking. Furthermore, the social protection report should be published annually and examined at the same time as the employment report. This is good, but it is not enough. We are proposing a procedure similar to the Luxembourg process. Clear guidelines and indicators are needed, while Member States must develop methods in national action plans. We are shaping a common model, but maintaining subsidiarity. This social convergence is a process that will continue for a long time. Therefore, Parliament must be involved in the work—not by joining the high-level group, but in such a way that Parliament's representative can monitor the work in this group and come up with proposals on how to continue the process. The Commission's proposal, like cooperation on employment, is based on four main objectives. These are: making the system job-friendly, making the pension system sustainable in the long term, promoting social integration, and ensuring sustainable and high-level health protection. All these points are important. In our report, we particularly emphasized the importance of combating poverty in the EU and of finding indicators as quickly as possible in order to make progress in this area. Equality between men and women does not have its own pillar. This is about mainstreaming. Aspects of equality between men and women must therefore be reflected in all four pillars. We have taken careful note of this. We are tabling a multitude of proposals to, for example, move towards individualized social protection systems, ensure that parental leave entitles people to social security benefits, improve opportunities for reconciling family and professional life, and ensure that basic old-age pensions ensure a decent standard of living. These proposals primarily benefit women. Alongside this European social convergence strategy, a concrete plan is needed for legislative work in the social field, as well as proposals for a framework agreement in the context of social dialogue with a concrete timetable. We expect Parliament to present this in its proposal for a social action programme. Social convergence is also necessary in view of enlargement, on the one hand to strengthen the social model and, on the other, to eliminate the risks of social dumping. The Commission must consider drawing up a specific action programme relating to social policy in the context of enlargement. We had a constructive discussion in committee. We had many amendments, but we managed to agree on a report. The number of amendments submitted to Parliament for a vote has now been reduced to fifteen. This is because we have significant convergence. Some of these amendments are returning from the reading to the committee, and I will reject them. I will also reject the amendments tabled by the TDI group, as I do not believe that they add anything to the report.	fr
This is where the decisive point must be made. I am convinced, esteemed Presidency, that this will be shaped accordingly positively under your leadership. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you will have gathered from the various statements that both in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and at the level of the group leaders in the European Parliament, the prevailing opinion, albeit not unanimous, was to trust the Portuguese Presidency and not to exacerbate the difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference. I can assure you that last week in the committee I chair, it was not easy to reach this conclusion, but in the end we decided to bet on the Portuguese Presidency, and we do not want to lose our bet. You told us about the start of your tour of European capitals and the difficulties some governments are having in gaining support in their countries and, consequently, in their parliaments. I would like to draw your attention to what I consider a very interesting day of discussion and dialogue yesterday with representatives of the 15 national parliaments, who were present with knowledgeable and committed delegations. The aim was not to draw conclusions—which was not possible—but the debate was certainly very encouraging. I believe we must be vigilant and ensure that national governments seek to persuade their parliaments to ratify solutions that meet the needs of the Union's development, and not hide behind perceived parliamentary resistance in order to avoid signing the relevant decisions at the negotiating table of the Intergovernmental Conference. In any case, we will intensify our cooperation and dialogue with the governments of the Member States throughout the Intergovernmental Conference. Yesterday, we also discussed the Commission, represented by Commissioner Barnier, who explained its position. Their efforts were appreciated, although different views were expressed on the proposals, just as I believe you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, expressed different points of view. It should be emphasized, however, that yesterday, too, many people were aware of the danger that enlargement could call into question the original concept of establishing a political union. This was also pointed out in an interview that, due to the authority of its author, Jacques Delors, will surely have escaped no one's notice. We must therefore ensure that, during the Intergovernmental Conference, there is genuine discussion about how to strengthen the democratic foundations of the Union, how – and this was also discussed yesterday in this House when the situation in Austria was discussed – the system of principles, values, and rights that underpins the Union, and the role of the Union's political institutions, including in the area of economic policy. We are relying on the Portuguese Presidency, we are relying on ourselves and on the Commission, so that all these issues can be debated constructively and coherently within the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference. Mr President, Only a strengthened Europe can manage enlargement. Only a strengthened Europe can counter political opportunists who exploit discontent. Therefore, fundamental reforms and, consequently, an expanded agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference are needed. The Finnish Presidency has listened only to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, has not shown itself in the least bit receptive to this Parliament.	de
We have all heard some of the stories coming from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels. I am also unclear about the extent to which we will achieve any form of convergence on defense spending, as some Member States spend considerably more than others. And, in fact, some Member States are not oriented toward mobility. They are very static in their military forces and unsuited for that kind of warfare. Perhaps I could turn to Mr. Patten as well and ask him, from the point of view of the conflict prevention work we will be doing, to what extent we will be able to examine long-term conflict-causing situations, such as environmental degradation and water scarcity, and include them in core EU policies, particularly in the area of development, because it is pointless to try to react quickly to something that has taken us years to prepare. And finally, let me also echo Mrs. Schroedter's remarks, to the effect that we need a parliamentary dimension to this defense development. We cannot simply leave it to governments. When Mr. Solana last spoke in this Parliament, I was extremely critical of the fact that he barely mentioned the idea of conflict prevention, and today there is much talk here about such prevention, but no proposal to seriously implement it. We talk a lot and with pride about how a contingent of 60,000 soldiers can be prepared in 60 days for a whole year, but we currently have crises in Europe and on its borders and elsewhere that this Union is failing to address, which is abject. What we need are 60,000 civilian police to try to address these situations. Mr. Solana has given us no information about the means that will be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya. Mr. Solana has told us nothing about whether he or the European Union is making any serious diplomatic intervention—serious diplomatic interventions—to stop the carnage in Chechnya. We have significant gaps in our fundamental defense of human rights. We mustered up our capacity to intervene in Kosovo, and now we are creating absolute chaos in that province by not sending adequate resources and personnel to address the situation, thereby demonstrating our inability to meaningfully address conflict prevention. Therefore, I would like Mr. Solana to explain to this House the European Union's position on Chechnya. What are we seriously going to do to put an end to this appalling situation? We have levers we could use with Russia, if we so chose, but we are determined not to. Mr. President, Mr. High Representative, Mr. Commissioner, I would like to ask you two questions, Mr. Solana. How can you, with any credibility, continue to deepen military and defense collaboration if the Member States are unwilling to fulfill their shared commitments?	es
However, it would be more appropriate for the Union to concentrate its financial expenditure on existing Community policies. Some are naturally taking the opportunity to outdo each other in demanding more financial resources, which is particularly inappropriate at a time when national budgets are being forced to undergo a drastic reduction due to the convergence criteria for EMU. Mrs. McCarthy, for example, proposes increasing the budget for URBAN and publicizing this Community initiative through an expensive public relations campaign extolling the benefits of a federal Europe. It should go without saying that the effectiveness of an expenditure does not depend on the amount of money allocated to a project. On the contrary, recipients of excessive and excessive subsidies will ultimately accept them as a given. The aim must not be to turn citizens into beneficiaries of aid, but to strengthen their autonomy. The report also makes a strong case for measures in favor of ethnic or sociological minorities. We can only reject a minority policy that is necessarily detrimental to social cohesion. On the one hand, it promotes the integration of immigrants, whereas their cultural assimilation in the host country is necessary to avoid the creation of ethnic ghettos that could become powder kegs. On the other hand, it tampers with the principle of positive discrimination, which, as the American precedent shows, is proving to be an equally harmful chimera. For all these reasons, the French delegation of the UEN Group could not vote in favour of Mrs McCarthy's report. Decourrière report (A5-0028/2000) Mr President, the INTERREG programme is particularly dear to our hearts. Like many other Members, I am delighted that the European Parliament has succeeded in preserving this INTERREG initiative. As I myself live in the Belgian part of the Sarre-Lor-Lux South region, I know that Europe is being built there, that we experience Europe every day, and that the process of European integration is truly being driven by the people. These projects must be genuinely considered and must already incorporate sustainable development. Why do I emphasize this point? For the simple reason that current projects, by their very nature, still all too often harm the environment. If, for example, one accepts new roads, then one accepts new emissions in the European Union, and this completely contradicts the policy we propose, for example, to combat greenhouse gas emissions. I also demand that the Commission, when selecting projects, ensure that the environmental pillar of EU policy is integrated into these projects, so that, for example, the objective of CO2 reduction is considered a specific added value in the proposed projects. I am thinking in particular of certain infrastructure projects currently being planned. As is well known, some Member States have not yet decided between rail and road for crossing vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees, and in particular the Aspe Valley. I am also thinking of my region, where my Member State is still undecided between a railway line and a second motorway, the A32. I therefore call on the Commission to pay particular attention here too to ensuring genuine consistency between the various policies, and particularly within the selected INTERREG projects. Mr President, I voted in favor of the Decourrière report on the INTERREG Community Initiative, particularly because of Commissioner Barnier's response to some Members who called for greater consideration of maritime border regions in the programme.	de
I hope that all these problems can be addressed and dealt with within the framework of the discussion currently taking place on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Externally, I believe that most of the points we have included in the resolution provide a fairly approximate view of reality and do not exactly inspire optimism, Mr. President, since aspects such as the abolition of the death penalty, the torture still practiced in many so-called democratic countries, or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world require a clear, visible, and effective response from the European Union. In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would focus on one very specific one, which is the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations. Mr. President, in a world like today's, increasingly dominated by the phenomenon of globalization, and not only in the economic sphere, we must provide concerted and coordinated responses for these responses to be effective. To achieve this effectiveness in our action, it is necessary to implement a practical coordination that does not exist today. Therefore, this Parliament defends the principle of the need to participate in the Committee on Human Rights and other international forums where these matters are addressed, and, Mr. President-in-Office of the Council, this Parliament would like to be able to participate in these types of meetings as soon as possible. Soon, in May, the European Commission plans to present a communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratization in the Union's external relations. I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to take full account of this need for coordination I have just mentioned and to seek new ways to strengthen the role played by the European Union in the field of human rights, and in particular by this Parliament, especially from a perspective of coherence, recognizing the willingness of those third countries that agree to include the democracy clause. I believe that this should have an impact on all matters—and I am referring very specifically to the budgetary effect as well. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the important contributions that civil society can make in this field, as well as the often undervalued role of the many non-governmental organizations operating on the ground. The Union must strive to provide them with all the necessary support so that they can carry out their important work. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, when this House must discuss the issue of human rights, it runs a grave risk, which, if you will, is exacerbated by the climate in which we must debate this very important topic. The absence of the Council and of almost all the Members of Parliament shows us how wide the gap remains between noble, important, and useful declarations, from a formal point of view, and the concrete application of the issue of human rights in the realm of everyday politics. I believe that this Parliament, starting with the contribution that the European Union will make to the Geneva meeting, must fill this gap and contribute not only in terms of the enunciation of principles, but also in terms of truth and even loyalty.	es
All this was conditioned by the adoption of a budget which imposed limitations in various areas, and in particular by the need to allocate funds for the implementation of the special plan for the reconstruction of Kosovo. Parliament already approved a total of 34 amendments at first reading and the Council, in its common position, took up 18 of them in full or in part. Of the 16 remaining, some, such as amendments Nos 5 and 6 in particular, are now superfluous after the Interinstitutional Agreement on the budget for 2000. The discussion and negotiations which we held with the Council and the Commission centred on three issues: the budget, the timetable and comitology. Your rapporteur would particularly like to emphasise the commitment and flexibility shown by all to bring the budgetary positions closer together so that from an initial allocation of EUR 9 million for line B7-6201, which meant a total of EUR 73 million for the whole period, we have reached an agreement providing for EUR 249 million for the next seven years, starting from the EUR 30 million already foreseen in the budget for 2000. Following this budgetary agreement - which implicitly includes an agreement on the timing - the differences have coalesced around issues of comitology due to historical positions of Parliament and the Council which, with a view to the future - and without dwelling on the problems indicated by Mr Wijkman - should in my opinion be reviewed by an interinstitutional agreement to make the parliamentary legislative procedure more agile and fluid. I conclude by recommending that the House accept amendments Nos 1 and 2. 1, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12 and the rejection of the others because, if they were to be accepted, they would cancel the agreement reached after the discussions with the Commission and the Council and would force us to start the whole negotiation procedure again, paralysing certain projects and actions to be carried out, and undoubtedly causing serious problems for the policy of conservation and restoration of tropical forests that we want to develop. Mr President, I think that the rapporteur, Mr Fernandez Martín, who spoke before me, is right on many points in his report. First of all, for all the budget lines it is very important to talk about their respective financial allocations. Just as for the report we have just discussed, I am not satisfied with the limited duration, but, in view of the very many projects at risk, this argument is excellent for aiming for an agreement with the Council as quickly as possible. As with the Wijkman report, I am in favour of the split comitology proposed by the rapporteur, i.e. dealing with the strategic lines using a management procedure and the measures concerning the implementation of the projects in an advisory committee. One point which I consider particularly important is the emphasis placed in several amendments - for example in Amendment No 2 and Amendment No 4 - on the active participation of forest-dependent people and local communities. This is, in my opinion, a very essential point, especially in the context of sustainable management of tropical forests and other forests in developing countries.	it
If this certificate and proof of insurance are not presented, the ship will be decommissioned and will not be allowed to leave the port, despite all port fees. We must agree on this in all ports of the European Union, from Marseille to Rotterdam, Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, and wherever ships dock. Fourth, we need liability from the shipowner—not just a paltry $12 million, but at least $400 million, which the shipowner must prove with proof of insurance. Then we need liability from the country whose flag the ship flies. We need the assurance that the country under whose flag the ship sails will assume liability in case of doubt. This will be a wonderful control measure! I can guarantee you that the countries that issue the flag will then ensure that they are not held liable. Fifth, we need a guarantee that this will be required of all ships in the ports and waters of the European Union, including in the accession countries. This means that the requirements I have mentioned apply to all waters. Finally, we need the most important thing: we need a good memory, because we will be talking more often about legislation here in the near future. We will be talking more often about environmental standards. Then I don't want anyone to come along and say: These requirements will lead to job losses in the port. The unions will come, the industry will come. We need a good memory, colleagues. I'm looking at many of you who have not previously represented the leading edge of the environmental movement. Go home and say: We haven't bothered about the standards so far. We need a good memory when it comes to what is required in the ports. We need a good memory when we say: Let's agree on port fees and port requirements, and not play one off against the other in the European Union. If we can achieve that, we might be better off in a few years! Mr. President! Ms. Roth-Behrendt spoke from my heart. She provided us with a perfect compilation of the various measures. But how do we use the crisis awareness we have developed as a result of this environmental disaster? Let me cite as a comparison the introduction of the load line mark of a previous generation, a marking intended to prevent insurance fraud involving conditionally seaworthy ships. Where has the crisis awareness of the generations before us gone? I think we should introduce the certificate Ms. Roth-Behrendt mentioned, as well as the marking of tankers with green marks, as suggested by some ports in Europe. Furthermore, the classification societies must be critically examined, because we cannot accept their practices. We need an independent and transparent process. Finally, I would like to mention that some Commission departments consider it to be improper shipyard subsidies in my country when environmental subsidies are paid to shipowners who want to improve environmental quality. In other words, the right hand at the Commission doesn't know what the left hand is doing. It is unacceptable that measures that are in line with the Commission's environmental improvement guidelines should not be allowed to be implemented because they are considered to be inadmissible support for shipyards.	de
"They alone are capable of inventing policies capable of changing structures that were developed by men for men. Because it is structural discrimination that women are most confronted with, whether in politics or on the job market. It is therefore up to European political parties to open up to women. Moreover, Article 191 of the Treaty (ex 138 A) underlines, and I quote, their ""important role as a factor of integration within the Union."" This article goes on to state that ""they contribute to the formation of a European consciousness and identity, as well as to the expression of the political will of the citizens of the Union."" While such a provision has no legal value, it is nonetheless highly symbolic. It gives political parties an important role in the construction of a democratic Europe. This can be achieved, for example, by implementing positive actions, by promoting parity within our political parties. Some parties presented gender-balanced lists for the 1999 European elections. This is a good practice that should be made more widespread. I don't know if there is a causal link, but the fact remains that the proportion of women MEPs in the European Parliament rose from 25.7% in 1994 to 29.9% in 1999. Furthermore, it has been chaired by a woman since the 1999 elections. I will conclude by repeating the conclusions drawn from the April 1999 conference organized by the Commission, entitled ""Women and Men in Power."" Equality between men and women is not an issue that concerns only women; it is an issue that affects our entire society! Progress has recently been made in increasing the number of women in the Union's decision-making bodies. In our own institution, 30% of elected representatives are now women, including the President of the European Parliament herself. Finland has also just elected a woman president. On average, almost a quarter of Member State governments and just over a fifth of their parliaments are composed of women. These rates are still far from satisfactory, especially given that the figures vary greatly between Member States: women in the Nordic countries are far more represented in positions of responsibility and decision-making processes. This situation is more a reflection of respect for the quality and competence of women's contribution to society than the result of fixed quotas. My group does not support the use of quotas in general because, in the long run, they risk being counterproductive or even undermining the cause they are intended to support. We nevertheless recognize that experiences vary from one Member State to another and that some recourse to such measures is sometimes justified, as a temporary remedy, with a view to rebalancing the representation of women where they are clearly underrepresented. We could support the resolution on women in decision-making, adopted to commemorate International Women's Day on 8 March, to which the Liberal Group tabled ten amendments and relaxed the reference to quotas in line with the approach put forward above."	fr
The Balkan and Adriatic regions are particularly important, but in my opinion, cooperation with Russia should not be forgotten either. Our group wishes to raise the issue of monitoring the use of funds again and insists, in particular, on better coordination of the TACIS, ISPA, and PHARE programs. This coordination is lacking, and the Commission has still not presented any specific plans to improve it. Here in Parliament, we expect the European Commission to inform our committee in more detail as soon as possible. In practical implementation, the involvement of businesses, organizations, and other local stakeholders is of decisive importance. Cooperation projects, based on experience, require better planning, more precise monitoring, and more successful implementation. Projects have often been left halfway, and efficiency has been lost in administration and bureaucracy. We must also demand commitment from the partners to the projects and to fulfill their part. Our group is reintroducing several amendments that were rejected during the committee's examination. I will again refer to the Urban report, in whose explanatory memorandum the rapporteur commendably addressed the minimum of EUR 500 per capita, which refers to the Commission's guidelines. This will not work as a mechanical objective, but it must be possible to apply it depending on the circumstances prevailing in the region concerned. This is such an important aspect that it must be deferred from the explanatory memorandum to the conclusions. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Interreg is the initiative with the most European dimension of all the structural funds. Here, projects must not only be promoted at regional or national level, but also in border regions that involve two or more countries. Unfortunately, this only applies to part of the money, namely to the borders within the EU. But it is precisely the regions bordering third countries that require an effective instrument promoting cross-border cooperation. The regulation claims that this is the case. However, it is not. We are in a situation where the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has long demanded it. In concrete terms, this will mean a further deterioration in the situation for these regions in terms of support for border areas. Parliament has been demanding the creation of a common fund for cooperation with third countries since 1996 in order to eliminate these difficulties. Nothing has happened! These problems will once again drag on, at the expense of the regions concerned. Therefore, Parliament is once again demanding an improvement in this regard and the development of cross-border cooperation. We are also waiting for a common fund to be created and for the regulation to be amended again in collaboration with the other Commissioners. We want a Europe of citizens, not a Europe of bureaucrats! Mr President, a third of the European Union's resources go to funds for various development objectives.	fr
In the case of Turkey, the situation is different: the plant does not yet exist and, as I have already said, Turkey has acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Convention on Nuclear Safety. If, during the development of the nuclear plant, there are safety concerns, we will discuss them with Turkey. If we were to conclude that Turkey is planning a nuclear power plant that is incompatible with European safety standards, we would act as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria. I believe that it is the right of a Member of Parliament to express his or her concerns or fears. I do not share these concerns. I believe that Turkey fully recognises the standards and criteria of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, but there is no doubt that European public opinion has some concerns and I think it is only right to discuss them in this Parliament. Question No. 29, by the Honourable Member (H-0786/99): Subject: Weapons containing depleted uranium Has the Commission carried out any studies on the effects that cross-border pollution resulting from the use of weapons containing depleted uranium during the Kosovo conflict could have on EU Member States? If not, why not? Commissioner Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission. Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your question. The European Commission has been studying the effects of the conflict on the environment since the first NATO actions. Back in June, the Commission funded the first study carried out by the Regional Environmental Centre for Central and Eastern Europe and concluded that no large-scale ecological disaster had occurred. None of the evidence gathered since then or any subsequent analysis has contradicted that first assessment. The Commission was also closely involved in the preparation of the recent report published by the United Nations Environment Programme - Balkan Task Force. This is the most detailed and comprehensive report yet on the environmental consequences of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to anyone who has not read it. The use of depleted uranium weapons is one of several issues addressed and the report is also available online. The Balkan Task Force has been hampered by a lack or paucity of information about the actual use of such weapons during the conflict. The Balkan Task Force's fact-finding mission in Kosovo did not find any signs of contamination. However, this does not rule out the possibility that certain areas of Kosovo may have been contaminated with depleted uranium. Based on the theoretical assessment coupled with the on-site fact-finding mission the report concludes that any risks, if any, would be limited to the area surrounding the target. The Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe provides for further initiatives and a special regional environmental clean-up plan is being developed which will provide the framework for emergency assistance in the event of conflict damage, should such assistance become necessary. Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Commissioner for the very helpful answer she gave me.	it
We have not heard that, beyond the proclaimed and positive objective of eradicating child poverty, individual autonomy would be strengthened by establishing decent minimum incomes in each Member State, which would be part of a genuine strategy to combat exclusion. We have not heard that the objective of full employment would include support for local and regional initiatives, the hidden sector of the solidarity economy, the effective and coordinated reduction of working hours, and would be accompanied by strict requirements regarding the quality and durability of these jobs. We have not heard that the long-awaited growth would be based on choosing sustainable development. We do not find in the Portuguese Presidency document or in the Commission's 2000 Strategic Guidelines the slightest trace of the legislative project in the social area, to strengthen the protection of workers against dismissal or to combat social dumping. Of course, we cannot but express our solidarity with the concern of the Council and the Commission to finally provide the European Community, after the single market, after the euro, with a political project proposed to all its residents. However, the new governance you are using, abusively in my view, lacks the participatory democratic ambition to which the emerging European civil society aspires. Madam President, Mr. Prime Minister and President of the Council, the situation in the Union and in most of the Member States raises legitimate concerns, despite the current economic recovery. The unemployment rate remains at quite high levels, long-term unemployment is constantly worsening, and employment levels are extraordinarily low. These factors are also accompanied and aggravated by the increasing precariousness of employment and which, in reality, reflect a social situation that particularly affects women and young people and is dramatically marked by the nearly 50 million people who are excluded. On the eve of the Extraordinary Council meeting dedicated to these problems, the fundamental question that arises, therefore, is whether or not there is political will to change this situation. Or, on the contrary, if we are merely facing yet another inconsequential initiative, added to successive plans, strategies, and summits already dedicated to this issue in the past, from which no fundamental change has resulted. In our opinion, it is not only necessary to change this state of affairs, but it is also possible to do so. Necessary because employment, and quality employment with rights, constitutes a fundamental human right. Possible, if its true causes are addressed, which, in our opinion, are inseparable from the neoliberal drift that has characterized the fundamental orientations, particularly in the macroeconomic sphere, which has exponents in the priority given to the Stability Pact and the criteria of nominal convergence and, consequently, in the secondary nature of social cohesion, generally accompanied by the complete deregulation of labor, the incentive to privatization, mergers and company relocations, generally causing unemployment, but also by a deeply restrictive budgetary policy at the Community and national levels.	es
We want to see uniform rules for shipping at European Union level, covering all its technical, economic, social, and environmental aspects. The dangerous practices of flags of convenience must be banned without exception in the ports and waters of the 15 Member States and the 13 candidate countries. Furthermore, together with the Union for the Development of the Sea, we advocate the creation of coastguards and the deployment of maritime inspectors under the direct supervision of the shipping areas affected, to ensure strict compliance with European legislation. The resolution adopted points in this direction and has therefore received the full support of our group. I am pleased that the resolution on the impact of the Erika oil spill, to the drafting of which our group made a significant contribution, was adopted virtually unanimously. Unlike our previous resolution, it takes more account of the scale of the disaster, which is proving every day to be greater than initial impressions would suggest, and is therefore more ambitious, precise, and urgent. It is currently almost impossible to assess the overall damage caused to all sectors of fishing, seafood, and aquaculture. What is certain, however, is that it is considerable. The balance is exacerbated daily by new pollution incidents. The losses are reflected not only in reduced sales, but also in financial losses. The damage to the reputation of seafood cannot yet be expressed in figures. Added to this are the damage caused to upstream and downstream sectors (fish wholesalers, suppliers, tourism, etc.), as well as the costs incurred by local authorities in cleaning up the pollution and repositioning themselves in the tourism sector. Fishing and tourism, the two closely interrelated main sources of income for most regions of our Atlantic coast, are thus both severely affected. It is therefore necessary, as we did in our resolution, to emphatically emphasize the polluter pays principle, supplemented by the polluter's obligation to remedy the damage. It is the polluter's duty to pay for the clean-up of the areas polluted through their fault and for the restoration of the ecological balance disturbed by their fault. The victims are deeply concerned about the compensation process, as the initial payments made by FIPOL to victims are limited to 25%. This is scandalous. Every victim must, of course, be fully compensated. It would be absolutely unthinkable to burden victims with part of the damage caused solely by the polluter's negligence. Furthermore, our resolution welcomes the initiatives taken by some local authorities, such as the Vendée department, to record the precise state of the coast before the first oil slick hit. This process is exemplary because it allows for accelerated compensation for victims, whether individuals or local authorities. Finally, our resolution makes it clear that in the area of maritime safety, it is essential to put an end to the vicious circle of generalized irresponsibility, this absurd system of mutual paralysis in which states and the Union shift responsibility to the benefit of those who cause the damage. Each must fulfill its respective responsibilities. The Commission, whose American reflex failed to materialize this time, must urgently develop a general framework for maritime safety.	de
We know that this waste exists and how we must deal with it, and there is no excuse for inaction. This directive pursues three objectives. First, we want to limit the use of toxic heavy metals in the manufacture of new cars. Second, we want to establish the responsibility of manufacturers. We can no longer concern ourselves with products at the end of their life cycle; we must focus on waste prevention. As many of the various materials contained in the product as possible must be recovered. Third, we want to achieve the recycling targets specified in this directive. These are the three main intentions of the directive. Not recycling the material present in cars is a waste of resources. Above all, not addressing a car's life cycle is a wasteful use of the manufacturer's resources. Two very important questions have been raised here—there are others, of course, but I would like to mention the two most important ones. First, who should pay for this? The second question is: are we weakening the competitiveness of the European automotive industry with this proposal? The first question, therefore, is who should bear the costs. According to the directive, these costs should be borne primarily by the manufacturer, in accordance with the principles of producer responsibility and the polluter pays principle enshrined in the EU Treaty. However, it is clear that these costs are borne jointly by the manufacturer and the consumer. We have calculated that the cost of recycling a car amounts to no more than 1% of the price of a new vehicle. Can we fool ourselves into thinking that this money will disappear if the directive is not adopted? No, of course we will all have to bear the costs of environmental destruction, and this will be considerably more expensive. Moreover, these costs will only become apparent after a longer period of time. So the costs are not disappearing, but we are now making clear where responsibility lies and how the financial burden should be distributed. Are we talking about a crisis-ridden automotive industry here? Is the discussion about an economic sector with low profit margins that we need to support by not imposing even more burdens on it? Can the automotive industry simply not afford such a thing? Isn't our real intention to weaken the competitiveness of the European automotive industry? No, of course not! Do you think that consumer demand for environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars will fade away in the future? What do you think the demands our children and grandchildren, or the legislators of the future, will place on cars? Of course, that they must be environmentally friendly, recyclable, consume little fuel, and not pollute our environment! Only in this way can we give the automotive industry a future. We must create healthy incentives for the recycling of waste and the reuse of materials, so that we can compete with environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient vehicles. The fact that the European automotive industry has already made significant progress more than adequately compensates for the fact that even more cars are roaming around Europe, for which it must assume responsibility. This is not a matter of exorbitant sums of money or an insurmountable task.	de
Here, too, the water problem and the situation of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are still unresolved issues. Finally, I would like to address the question of a future Palestinian state. This could be declared this year, with or without Israel's consent. The Barak government has indicated that it is prepared to conclude a peace agreement with a state as a contracting party. Even if negotiations are not concluded by September of this year, there are no contractual obstacles to the declaration of a Palestinian state after that date. For those of us who support this idea, it is of great importance in this context that this state is characterized by transparency and democracy, as Commissioner Patten put it. We all want to contribute to this. Mr President, first of all, I would like to refer to the joint motion for a resolution presented at the end of this debate, to which my group contributed and to which we naturally agree. In particular, however, I would like to express our joy that Israel and Syria are once again reaching out to each other after such a long period of stagnation to resolve their differences. The recent negotiations represent, for the time being, an important step toward lasting peace in the Middle East. It is therefore regrettable that the peace talks have been temporarily suspended. Both sides will indeed have to make significant efforts. A stable peace in the region is only possible on the basis of an agreement that guarantees the security of Israel's borders and Syria's territorial integrity. This will also require the establishment of normal diplomatic relations and a permanent dialogue. Hopefully, in addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria, Israel will soon begin negotiations with Lebanon, and that a multilateral approach will prove possible within the framework of economic and regional cooperation. Unfortunately, the European Union, as one of the main donors, is still unable to play a significant political role in the peace process. This Middle East peace process is one of the priorities of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Mr Solana, Secretary-General of the Council and High Representative for the CFSP, has a special task in this regard. The Commission and the Member States must also be encouraged to support projects that help establish mutual understanding and partnership between the various peoples of the region. The importance of the Barcelona Process, which must have a positive impact on regional cooperation, should also be emphasized here. We support Syria's participation in this process, provided it recognizes human rights, does not provide aid to terrorists, and fully supports the peace process. Naturally, numerous problems remain unresolved and many questions remain unanswered, including in relations with the Palestinians. While the peace process is, as we know, lengthy and complicated, with the necessary trust, the indispensable political will, and the required perseverance, we are convinced that we will achieve our common goal of a peaceful and prosperous Middle East. Mr President, The fact that peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine, as well as between Israel and Syria, are underway despite certain delays and problems, is cause for celebration. The moment of truth is near. Is Israel prepared to comply with UN resolutions and return the Arab territories conquered in 1967 in exchange for peace and security?	de
Experience to date has clearly demonstrated that linear regulations on staff reductions and incentives for voluntary departure often have undesirable effects. I recall that the Belgian telephone company had to recall retired employees so that the company did not lose too much know-how and experience. Staff reductions will undoubtedly be a topic of discussion in the liberalization of postal services. It should not be forgotten that offers of voluntary departure are primarily accepted by those employees who are already working under pressure or who can easily find new employment; in other words, these are often workers whom the company itself needs. It would, in my view, demonstrate prudent human resources management if the Commission took some of these concerns to heart, so that the liberalization of such a sensitive sector as the postal service is as socially acceptable as possible. Mr President, postal services and post offices seem to be a very topical issue in Parliament at the moment, and rightly so, given their importance. Just last week, the newly elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners, Plaid Cymru, the Welsh party, delivered his maiden speech on this issue in the UK Parliament at Westminster. There was also a recent debate in the Scottish Parliament, which highlighted the role of post offices, particularly in rural areas, in providing services and supporting the survival of rural communities. Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services. Post offices in Scotland, as we have heard, do far more than just deliver the mail. Governments and some local authorities have traditionally used them as a place to pay pensions and other benefits, as well as rents, council tax, and so on. But as the modernisation of public finance systems increasingly moves towards electronic payments through direct debit and transfer, the viability of rural post offices is under threat. The closure of a rural post office, which usually includes the only local shop, can pose a major threat to the viability of the community and social cohesion. Rather than allowing post offices to be undermined by liberalization or the modernization of systems, governments, and indeed the Commission, should encourage and support a widespread network of post offices and view them as an asset to be built upon by providing public information and services from a location convenient for local residents. Mr. President, it is the responsibility of the Post Office to ensure that mail is delivered everywhere, in town and country, every day, at the same rate for everyone. For 150 years, the post office has been a public service and, like public transport and electricity supply, a core function of national governments. Such obvious and useful core functions give people a reason to vote. They will show considerably less interest in a government that does not concern themselves with such matters.	de
We are losing market share. I think we must do something to make ourselves more competitive. I hope you will help us. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are today discussing a very important sector that directly employs more than 10 million people in the European Union and that is helping more or less disadvantaged, remote, and island regions get back on their feet. Tourism also creates additional jobs, thus stimulating employment, particularly among the most vulnerable social groups, namely women and young people. However, I believe this is in blatant contradiction to the fact that there is no European tourism policy. Due to the lack of a legal basis, no measures can be taken in this area. The repeated invocation of Article 308 (formerly Article 235), which requires unanimity for a legal act, has not even made it possible to adopt a program worth ECU 8 million for five years and fifteen Member States. The measures occasionally taken to date have been fragmented and therefore ineffective; the regulations have been subject to the dictates of parallel policies, such as consumer protection, the environment, transport, taxation, etc., which have often not only failed to promote tourism but, in fact, hindered it, as their implementation usually entailed costs for the tourism industry without any examination of whether it could actually bear these costs or what incentives existed to bear them. I note with regret that, as part of the restructuring of the Commission's services, tourism is now not even a directorate, but merely a department within the Directorate-General for Enterprise. Yet we should support our tourism sector! In our opinion, key pillars that could lay the foundation for this are the inclusion of a substantive chapter on tourism in the reform, which would also constitute the legal basis for the sector; the development of an EU-wide tourism policy that promotes the sector without compromising the functioning of the tourism market; the coordination of tourism policy with other Community policies that directly or indirectly affect the sector; its study; and medium- and long-term measures to promote the competitiveness of tourism products. Since we are talking about employment, I would like to point out another very serious problem: the bankruptcies of tour operators and their impact, especially on hotels that are small and medium-sized enterprises and therefore lack the necessary equipment and access to information to verify whether their contractual partners are solvent. Clearly, it is not enough to act solely at the national level. Rather, EU-wide measures to improve relations between hoteliers and tour operators, such as a charter, could be considered. It would also be conceivable to establish a special fund for bankruptcy cases in cooperation with representatives of both sectors. The Commission has already requested quantitative data on the losses suffered by companies as a result of such bankruptcies in order to gain an understanding. It has also called on the European associations of both the hotel and catering industry and travel agencies, HOTREC and ECTAA, to draft a regulation regulating their mutual relations. Since then, however, no progress has been made.	de
"However, despite the good results they achieve in their studies, women are underrepresented in individual scientific disciplines. This underrepresentation of women can no longer be tolerated. I therefore note the European Commission's proposals with great satisfaction. The objective of the Commission's document is to focus on the measures to be taken at Community level, and in particular within the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development. I naturally agree with this. In the coming years, the aim is to achieve a 40% participation of women in Marie Curie fellowships and in the advisory and evaluation bodies for the entire Fifth RTD Framework Programme. To achieve this, it is necessary to improve debate and the exchange of experience between the individual Member States and to establish a ""Women and Science"" data collection group within the Fifth RTD Framework Programme, whose task will be, in particular, to collect and disseminate statistical data on women's participation in the research activities of the Fifth RTD Framework Programme. Furthermore, I share the rapporteur's opinion that studies must be conducted into the reasons for the discrepancy between the number of women with degrees in scientific subjects and the number actually working in these fields. Based on a better analysis of the obstacles women face, a strategy to eliminate them can then be developed. We must mobilize the numerous existing networks of women scientists and obtain their support in developing a common research policy. The European Parliament will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Development (RTD) with a view to promoting women and will develop ideas for the direction of the next programme. In the field of science and research, as in all other European Union policies, the gender dimension must be integrated in order to put an end once and for all to the structural discrimination that prevents women from competing on an equal footing in the labor market. (FR) In its communication ""Women and Science,"" the Commission announces its good intention of mobilizing women to enrich European research. That's very good, and we're pleased about it. Indeed, there are too few women involved in research in the European Union. We know that we can only change this underrepresentation of women in science through a school guidance policy that systematically promotes the diversification of girls' career aspirations, and, after they have graduated, through positive action at the professional level. That said, some Members are obviously uneasy because the report of the Committee on Women's Rights, which we have adopted, contains a point that is open to misunderstanding and which some interpret as a quota requiring a 40% share of women in European research. This, of course, is not the case; such a quota would be unrealistic. Moreover, the report does not specify a deadline by which such a quota should be achieved. In order to calm people's minds and allay my colleagues' concerns, I have tabled an amendment to the resolution simply to note that the Commission, in its communication, undertakes to make a significant effort to increase the participation of women in Community research programmes, which is certainly commendable."	de
Use of the precautionary principle The agenda is the Commission communication on the use of the precautionary principle. I will begin by saying that I am pleased to present this communication on the use of the precautionary principle which I have drafted together with Commissioners David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen. The precautionary principle is not a new concept. The Community has had frequent recourse to it for some time now in various policy areas: the health of the environment, human health, animals and plants. Moreover, in addition to appearing in various international texts such as the Rio Declaration and the more recent Protocol on Biosafety, it has been explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty, starting with Maastricht. The substance of the precautionary principle is clear: it involves taking certain measures in a given policy area where science is not certain, but there are reasons to fear that the potential risks are such that such measures are urgently needed. In recent years, however, recourse to the precautionary principle has increasingly come to the fore. Incidents such as the BSE or dioxin crisis have given rise to a lively public debate on the circumstances justifying and making precautionary measures necessary. In the light of this growing interest, the Commission has deemed it useful to present a Communication to set out its position on the precautionary principle. The main objective of this Communication is twofold. First, to clearly and logically explain how the Commission applies (and intends to apply) the precautionary principle to its risk management and, secondly, to set out application guidelines based on considered and logical principles. We also hope that the Communication will contribute to a better understanding of risk management and to dispel the fear that the precautionary principle may be used arbitrarily as a disguised form of trade protectionism. The Commission's starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the areas of environmental, human, animal and plant health. Of course, this objective cannot be used to justify arbitrary or irrational measures, but it is possible to act even when science is not certain. Consequently, the precautionary principle does not lead to the politicization of science, as some have claimed, but leads us to choose between science and politics. The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends essentially on the level of protection desired and the level of risk that decision-makers are willing to accept for society. This decision is therefore, by its very nature, political. However, the measures that can subsequently be adopted must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the essential element of the document. The measures adopted must be proportional to the level of protection chosen - and therefore you don't need a sledgehammer to crack a peanut. There must be no discrimination in the application process, that is, the measures must not make distinctions on the basis of geographical origin.	it
These contradictions cannot be overcome with hypocrisy and fine words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernisation, concertation. Either the European Union becomes a true federal state with a true redistributive budget, true labour mobility, and then, only at this point, with common rules on work and welfare, or it will be better not to delude ourselves and delude ourselves about impossible paths of convergence, which sound good but which in reality harm especially the weakest. And we should all be aware of this. Mr President, departing from what some colleagues have said during today's debate, I am inclined to approve the Andersson report, also because I see significant differences in it compared to the Commission's communication. It seems to me, in particular, that the report, for which I would like to congratulate the author, supports the solidarity-based approach of the European social model. It defines the broad objectives of social policy, taking unequivocal positions that I am pleased to underline: against social dumping and in favour of the right to social security, for the objective of social convergence and above all, very concretely, in favour of equal opportunities for women. I also see some shortcomings in the insufficiently in-depth examination of the European Union's macroeconomic policy which contrasts the renewal of the European welfare state model in a solidarity-based way. Overall, however, I consider the report to be positive. Mr President, I take the floor to reiterate that we need to modernise social protection, a valid instrument, much more than just a step forward towards the construction of Europe. This is underlined in the report - in my opinion, excellent - by Mr Andersson. Europe, the European Union, although very strong in the economic and political sphere, would be unstable, weak and limited if we were not able to strengthen its social sphere, increasing the opportunities for finding a job for anyone who requests one and working concretely in favour of the most socially disadvantaged. Considering that every person has the right to social protection and a guaranteed minimum social income, I believe that we must not forget the situation of those who were not born in the European Union. Let us not forget that, during 1999, no less than 717,000 people came to compensate for our low birth rate. For this reason, in the social sphere, we need an immigration policy that is socially aware, as President Gutierres recently declared in Spain. We must also take into account the situation of those who, faced with economic changes, mergers, takeovers and new technologies, etc., see their employment opportunities threatened or reduced. We therefore need a training policy that enables and prepares people for new jobs to maintain their position or to have a second chance. Sometimes, in fact, as the title of the film confirms, the postman rings twice. I believe, in all modesty, that it is up to European, national and regional governments to ensure that the postman rings on more than one occasion. It seems to me, Commissioner, that the responsibility for promoting and coordinating these possibilities falls on the Commission. Mr President, in addition to congratulating Mr Andersson on his excellent work which justifies this general consensus, I would also like to thank the honourable Members for their contribution and move on to some comments on what has been said.	it
We must continue to keep inflation low, push ahead with liberalization, increasingly ensure competition, encourage the spread of information technology and all new technologies; stimulate science, the frontiers of science, have the pleasure of being at the frontiers of science. The upcoming Lisbon Summit, which will address these issues—the spread of technology, employment—is a decisive summit. It has taken four years to hold a summit of this kind. It is finally within our grasp: we cannot miss this opportunity. The final commitment is to a better quality of life. We began this chapter with the White Paper on food safety: now we must take major steps in the area of the environment. The case of the Erika ship and the poisoning of the Danube call for urgent intervention at European level to protect the environment. The time has come to think, and therefore to create, a European civil protection emergency structure. In too many cases, this is perceived as an afterthought. I believe it is opportune to start thinking about these things before disasters occur. These are the challenges before us: before the Commission and before all the European institutions. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, how will we measure the five years of our activity? How will we measure the results of those five years? I do not know, but certainly one unit of measurement could be the challenge we face together. We take a very simple parameter: turnout in the next European elections. If it is higher than the previous one, it will mean that we have met our challenge. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have all these major political challenges before us; however, thanks to the recent recovery, we also have great opportunities. This, ladies and gentlemen, can be the decade of Europe. And I say: this must be the decade of Europe. Madam President, Mr. President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)/European Democrats welcomes this debate and is pleased that the Commission has presented a document for its preparation. We also welcome the conclusions contained in that document, as well as the general content of the declaration just presented by the President of the Commission, Mr. Prodi. The conclusions of the document indicate that the five years of the Prodi Commission's mandate will be a period of major transformation. Europe will advance along the path of integration, and the Union will simultaneously embark on a phase of enlargement that aims to ultimately achieve the reunification of our continent. This is a demanding and ambitious approach, which we might even call prophetic. Mr. President of the Commission, we wish you the best of luck in making it a reality. However, we also wish to remind you that the present is the foundation on which the future rests, and we can only build the future if we pay attention to the present. I say this with all seriousness and also with concern.	es
"As Commissioner for the Budget, my corresponding responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors. This Board for the Development of Internal Audit Control will ensure effective and rigorous monitoring of internal auditing. I would like to emphasize that changing our control systems will in no way mean relaxing them. The proposed change will make them more effective both in terms of inputs and in terms of measurable and verifiable outputs. I can also specifically assure the House that we are not seeking what is sometimes called a ""big bang approach."" Financial control based on ex ante authorization for each spending department will only be abandoned when and as long as a department's internal control system proves fully adequate. I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms made by both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts on the functioning of the current centralized system of financial control. That Committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralized system of ex ante authorization. It was also very clear about the need to separate internal audit from financial control. Furthermore, I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the Court of Auditors' opinion regarding 1997. Naturally, the Court of Auditors will be able to give its esteemed opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation, but it is useful to recall the comments made to this House last month by Mr. Karlsson. ""The Commission's internal control,"" he said, ""is not sufficiently vigorous to prevent malfunctioning. For example, the Financial Controller granted ex ante authorization in most of the newly discovered cases of mismanagement or irregularity. At the same time, the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated manner by several bodies, especially by the Financial Controller himself, the Inspectorate-General, and certain units in Directorates-General."" The system of ex ante authorization was, no doubt, originally designed to ensure caution, but over the years it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions. I do not believe there is any real disagreement among us on this. From paragraph 10, I infer that the underlying concern of your honourable Members is that there must be a carefully managed transition. That will almost certainly be the tenor of the change, as you will see when you read the reform strategy document. Our objective, the objective of the committee, the objective of the Court of Auditors, is not to abolish financial control, but to rid ourselves of centralized financial control and improve upon it. Before leaving this subject, I would like to add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be retained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit system, which will take place in a matter of months. Turning quickly to the part of the resolution devoted to combating fraud, corruption, mismanagement, and nepotism: the most important new proposal in the report concerns public officials reporting perceived malpractice. As I made clear during the debates last September and on other occasions, we all believe it is positive to define the mechanisms for this as clearly as possible, although, of course, we hope that they will rarely be necessary."	es
"I would point out that our Parliament is requesting appropriations of 850 million ECU, which is not a huge amount in the Community budget, and that the current proposals are for 613 million ECU. It seems to me, in any case, that at least for the end of the implementation of LIFE, there would be a way for the Union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment. Allow me to conclude on the question of the way our institutions operate. The speech I hear today is: ""We absolutely must now reach a rapid conclusion. In short, you, Parliament, lower your expectations, especially your budgetary expectations! Because, if we do not quickly manage, within the framework of codecision, to establish the framework for the LIFE regulation, we will fall behind in its implementation for the year 2000, and it is true that the NGOs, the operators on the ground, are waiting for our funds. I would like to point out, however, that the Council has a very long time to form an opinion, that it submits its proposals to us a few months before the fateful deadline. We are constrained by the texts: four months maximum. We meet our deadlines and, afterwards, we are told: ""Wait! If you want to be reasonable, you have to accept our position because, in codecision, we don't have the time."" I believe that our Parliament often protests against this method, which does not specifically call anyone into question within the Council, and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs, since in reality it is a bit of a tradition, which the Council has maintained over time. But I would like to stress that, on this environmental issue, the budgetary question is central and that Parliament cannot give in to blackmail that would force it to be the only reasonable one in this matter. I therefore hope, firstly, that, in conciliation, our colleagues will support us - but the votes have always been very convergent in this area - but also that the Council and the Commission will listen to us and that we will each take a step towards each other. Mr President, Members of Parliament, it is true that we openly disapprove of some of the options taken by the Council and the Commission. And I will have the opportunity to elaborate on this later. However, it must be acknowledged, to begin with, that this regulation is better than the LIFE I and LIFE II regulations. Firstly, because the basic proposal has made LIFE more rigorous, more transparent and more rational. Secondly, because the common position incorporates certain essential aspects defended by the European Parliament at first reading, in particular the fact of retaining the promotion of employment as a criterion for selecting projects and the reduction of the overall impact of products from their production to their recycling and disposal, as the objective of LIFE ""environment""."	fr
Are there any objections to the minutes? (Parliament approved the minutes.) Madam President, I am usually present at the opening of the sitting at 5 o'clock on Monday afternoons. Yesterday, like many Members of the European Parliament, I was unable to attend because the Air France flight, which normally brings us here at 2:15, was cancelled by the airline without any explanation. This meant that we were very late. If Air France were to maintain this policy of boycotting the European Parliament, Parliament would have to take measures to prevent it from happening again. Thank you very much, Mr Medina Ortega. I regret this as much as you do. Would you be so kind as to put this in writing so that I can give the details to the relevant departments at Air France and also to the French Government? I really believe that this is no longer acceptable, and we must protest in the strongest possible terms. Madam President, the same thing happened to me yesterday as did Mr Medina Ortega. I believe that the French authorities – who have the honor of hosting the European Parliament in Strasbourg – should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union. In any case, Mr Napolitano, thank you. Madam President, I am not concerned about plane delays, but I would like to apologize for the absence yesterday of my colleague Caroline Lucas from the Green Group, a British MEP. She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning at an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow. Her identity was established, and although it was clearly established that she was an MEP, she was detained all day. I consider this completely intolerable. I would therefore ask you – and I have already sent you a letter to this effect, together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala – to urge the British authorities to ensure that such incidents do not happen again and to apologize to Mrs Lucas. Thank you, Mr Lannoye. I have received your letter and have already spoken to the British representation. Madam President, with regard to today's vote, I would like to make a request that I already raised yesterday during the oral debate on the EQUAL report. I would like to ask for the vote on the EQUAL Community Initiative to be postponed because we simply need a little more time to negotiate an important point. I am optimistic and truly look forward to the vote with composure and confidence; we will find the broadest possible support for this position on EQUAL. We just need a little more time to work out the details relating to the asylum issue, and I therefore ask that the vote be held instead of this morning. Madam President, I would like to say something in response to what Mr Lannoye mentioned: Mrs Lucas was arrested on the outskirts of Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base in Faslane. I have sympathy for this protest. However, I cannot express solidarity with Ms. Lucas, who is trying to hide behind her parliamentary immunity. I was also arrested for protesting in Faslane. I did not hide behind any immunity.	de
We know what happened recently in the UN General Assembly. We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or we risked seeing a resolution approved that included absolutely unacceptable arguments asserting that human rights are not universally valid and applicable. The scene in New York is different from that in Geneva. Last year's debate on sovereignty and humanitarian aid, held in New York, dealt with such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues. It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on capital punishment. The Geneva debate, however, focuses more on human rights. It may, therefore, be that we have a better chance of making progress there. Second, Cuba. I want to address this point directly because we Europeans are the subject of unjustified criticism; we are accused of not taking human rights seriously enough. We are deeply concerned about certain actions by the Cuban government last year that have further restricted citizens' freedoms, actions such as changes to the penal code and the scope of the death penalty. We are also concerned about the recent increase in the number of political detentions. We monitor the human rights situation through reports provided by NGOs and the activities of our human rights working groups based in the EU embassies in Havana. We have regularly expressed our criticism to the Cuban authorities, and Parliament has done the same. But I do not believe that attempting to isolate Cuba is the right approach. We want a just and open society in Cuba, a country that respects market principles, the sanctity of contracts, and the rule of law. We want to encourage a process of transition towards democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. My view is absolutely identical on the third issue I would like to address, namely, China. It's very simple: I want us to have relations with China. It would be too easy and self-defeating to want anything else, and it would be an insult to more than one-fifth of humanity. I also want to see China transformed through peaceful change into a free, pluralistic society that does not throw democracy activists or religious adherents into prison. So what are we to do? Of course, we must have enthusiastic trade relations with China and hope to be able to welcome that country into the WTO on reasonable terms. It is really inappropriate to talk about a World Trade Organization that does not include China—or even Russia, for that matter. But I do not think today, and I have never thought so, that our nascent economic relations with China—manifested, for example, by China's €25 billion surplus with the European Union—should silence us when it comes to the human rights situation in China. For me, the question is not whether we should address the issue of human rights in China—we have a duty and a legitimate interest in this matter—but rather how best to do so.	fr
We are also working in this direction to develop a deep and positive relationship with the Commission. Honourable Members, I do not have much to add on these subjects. In recent weeks, many events have occurred that I would like to refer to: Kosovo, the Middle East, Chechnya; many things that I would like to comment on with you. I would prefer, Madam President B, if you will allow me, to stop here in order to have sufficient time available to answer the questions that will be put to me. However, before doing so, allow me to report on a telephone conversation on Chechnya that I had a few hours ago with the Commissioner of the Council of Europe Gil-Robles who, having returned this morning from Chechnya, where he visited Grozny, contacted me by telephone to tell me his first impressions which, as you can imagine, are not good. The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is precarious and constantly worsening; in most cases there is no more hot food during the day: the Russian authorities are no longer distributing food, so it is the non-governmental organisations that are providing it. In Grozny at the moment there are about 20,000 people in desperate situations, who have to walk for kilometres and kilometres to find a place to eat something. However, there is something positive that is moving and I would like to report to Parliament. The Commissioner of the Council of Europe told me that last night, speaking with the President and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Russian authorities had agreed that representatives of the Council of Europe should join the humanitarian mission already present in Grozny, under the direction of the Russian authorities; negotiations are also underway with the Chairmanship-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to involve, if possible, representatives of that organisation. These are the only positive things that I can communicate at the moment; I hope that in the next few hours we will be able to have more information from Mr Gil-Robles and, above all, better news from the point of view of the authorities of the Russian Federation. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will stop here. I would just like to go back to what I said at the beginning. It is a great satisfaction to be able to participate in the work of this Parliament, to share with the honourable Members the work that is being done jointly by all the countries and by the Commission, with a clear objective, the objective that our European Union can participate, exercising the greatest possible weight at international level, in peacekeeping operations. Europe does not want to wage war anywhere, but rather to work together to ensure that there is peace and stability throughout the world. I would like to thank the High Representative, Mr Solana, very warmly. Mr Poettering now has the floor on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats. Thank you, Mr Poettering. Mr Poettering, it is clear that Commissioner Patten should speak in this debate. He will certainly be given the floor when he feels it is appropriate to speak.	it
Coordination is the key word here. The water problem is increasingly topical. Climate change and small increases in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation. Some regions are becoming drier, while many others are becoming wetter. It is time to act. In March, the Second World Water Forum will take place in The Hague. This forum advocates a global vision. This vision must lead to regional action plans for sustainable water management. For the European Parliament, the time for action is now. We must opt for a sustainable water policy and, at the same time, we must be realistic. But we cannot set the bar too low either. The common position is not ambitious enough. That is why it is essential to resort to previous international conventions or the OSPAR objectives. We must aim for the phasing out of hazardous products by 2020. This is understood for the marine environment. It is clear that this agreement must also apply to other waters. The OSPAR objectives are currently being drawn up. A list of 400 products that pose clear environmental hazards has been drawn up. Both technically and economically, it is possible to approach zero emissions of these substances, and that is the choice we must make. Naturally, the directive must also be binding. Downstream countries must be able to rely on upstream countries meeting the quality objectives. Quality has a price, but pollution may prove to have a much higher price in the future. Mr. President, Commissioner! I would like to express my deep admiration for the remarkable work Mrs. Lienemann has done on this water directive. Allow me to point out that the most serious environmental problems we face today - the transformation of climates, the devastation of virgin forests, the depletion of fishing resources - always affect resources that we share and that are absolutely indispensable to us, but which, in a certain sense, are also ownerless. Let us also recognize that the freshwaters of the European continent can be said to fall into a grey area, between what belongs to everyone and what belongs to no one. This is why establishing responsibilities in this area is of strategic importance. It is also essential that the individual watercourses be considered holistically, treated as the whole that they do indeed constitute, regardless of the country to which any particular part of their common course belongs. Dear colleagues, as has already been said several times, the proposal for a directive does indeed represent a historic opportunity to simplify and improve the plethora and veritable mosaic of EU regulations and directives and thus achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe. However, I have the impression that the policy of the Water Framework Directive is marked by deregulation and renationalization. I also hope that the vote will not be a complete waste of time, and two points are absolutely essential for me in this regard. First of all, OSPAR. We know that the Commission's proposal does not go far enough; unfortunately, the same is true of the proposal from the Committee on the Environment.	fr
Fifth and finally, the aggregate to which the public deficit will refer will be the gross domestic product at current market prices, estimated according to the definitions of the 1995 European System of Accounts. In short, this Commission proposal is, in my opinion, a correct and concrete adaptation of the criteria established in the European System of Accounts 1995, which I therefore fully approve, as expressed by the Commission. Mr. President, it is positive that statistical data are not only reliable but also comparable. This is especially important for integration and the completion of the internal market. Hence, this report also has political significance, for which we sincerely congratulate the rapporteur. It also gives rise to a couple of political observations. The Stability Pact is a fact in Europe. All countries participating in the euro have committed themselves, through this Stability Pact, to achieving a balanced budget in the medium term or to running a small surplus. That, of course, doesn't mean that when the economic climate is adverse, there can't be some imbalance, but in the long and medium term, we speak of equilibrium or surplus. The stronger the position of the participating countries, the more stable the euro will be. Therefore, exceeding the 3% rule should happen rarely, not even in unfavorable economic circumstances—at least that's what logic dictates. We have always believed that these criteria must be strictly adhered to. It is very important for the EMU to be successful in the future. Strict adherence to the Stability Pact can contribute to creating a culture of stability in all Member States. Several Member States have adopted exclusive provisions to enable them to meet the criteria. We believe that Member States' budgetary policies must be strictly monitored so that the measures adopted to meet the established criteria continue to be applied. Any relaxation of these criteria cannot be permitted. Moreover, we believe that further spending cuts and reducing public debt must be among the priorities. After all, the expense is still being passed on to future generations. Mr. President, first of all, thank you very much to the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done. It was a subject that required a high degree of technicality, and I believe Mr. Knörr handled it with great precision and professionalism. I would not dare to summarize the content of our proposal better than he did; I would only make a brief additional comment, saying that, in addition to the ESA 95 adaptation, there are two minor technical modifications that Mr. Knörr is very familiar with, concerning interest and the valuation of foreign currency debt. I only mention this as a comment to give a complete overview of the process. Secondly, I would like to thank Mr. Knörr for his promptness. He has done a truly excellent job in a very short period of time.	es
First of all, it is essential to encourage private investment. The Union must help stimulate entrepreneurship and create jobs in this way, but we must not forget public investment. This has been the major victim of recent years, and an improvement in public finances must clearly allow us to improve public investment, while respecting our commitments on fiscal consolidation. Our major bet for the future must be research and development, but also human capital. These are two of the major challenges we will have to face in Lisbon. We believe it is essential to make progress on these challenges with quantified targets and specific definitions that will ultimately allow us to achieve what we all aspire to: net improvements in productivity that make possible increased growth in our society, as well as an increase in employment that allows us to regain some of the ground lost in recent years. This is the policy that the Commission has defended and that we will continue to defend in Lisbon. Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) The agenda calls for joint debate on the following reports: A5-0038/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation establishing a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data essential to the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy (COM(1999) 0541 - C5-0302/1999 - 1999/0218(CNS)); A5-0037/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on a financial contribution from the Community to the expenditure incurred by Member States in collecting data and in financing studies and pilot projects in support of the common fisheries policy (COM(1999) 0551 - C5-0303/1999 - 1999/0224(CNS)). The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this area are both to be welcomed. Hence this joint debate, since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other. I understand that they took about five years to prepare. It is important that rapid progress is now being made, in view of the 2002 review of the Common Fisheries Policy. Consider first the proposed Council Regulation. This requires Member States to collect a wider range of fisheries data than was required under previous regulations. Both biological and economic information are included. The proposal also requires Member States to produce such data in aggregated form. An implementing regulation will specify exactly what new data must be collected and which of these must be aggregated with existing data. The implementing regulation will establish a minimum Community program and an extended Community program. It appears that these programs will not cover the entire spectrum of potential data but will be selective, for example, according to fish stocks. The proposed Council Decision allows for the establishment of a financial contribution granted by the Community to Member States engaged in data collection and management.	fr
We will receive all draft implementing measures referred to a committee at the same time as that committee. We will have the opportunity to examine the drafts, discuss them, and ask questions. However, we will only be able to intervene officially with the Commission if we believe that the Commission has exceeded the implementing powers conferred on it. In other words, we can take action against an implementing measure that exceeds the Commission's powers, but we have no influence on the content of that measure. In a democracy, however, Parliament should also have the opportunity to question its content. We do not intend to do so all the time. We do not want to interfere in implementing decisions, but it is a democratic safeguard that we have this opportunity in the few cases where it seems absolutely necessary. This opportunity is missing in the new system, or at least exists only in a rudimentary form. Our fourth point of criticism is that an implementing measure blocked in the comitology procedure is not referred back to both legislative bodies, but only to the Council, which has the right to draft an alternative measure. This is incorrect. Both institutions—the Council and Parliament—adopt the legislation that confers implementing powers on the Commission. When implementing measures are referred back, this should be done not just to one institution, but to both. Overall, this system has achieved some improvements. The additional aspects resulting from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but they do not change the Council's basic decision. Even here, we voluntarily—this did not happen automatically—waived the Plumb/Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise. We were prepared to waive these provisions. We will have to monitor very closely what was previously covered by that agreement but is not fully covered by the new decision. We must be very vigilant. So, it is a step forward. My group reluctantly accepts this as a step forward. We are not as enthusiastic about compromise as Mrs. Frassoni. We recognize the limitations and are certain that this issue will be back on the agenda in a few years. If we want a democratic Union with the greatest possible transparency, we will have to address this issue again. Mr. President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs. Frassoni, for the work she has done. Dealing with comitology issues is never easy. Mrs. Schleicher has touched on a kind of 'committee magic' we have always spoken about. Certainly, the process has always been very complicated as a result of previous decisions that ultimately need to be streamlined. In my view, the agreement we have reached between the Commission and Parliament represents a clear streamlining of the process. In our view, it satisfies Parliament's fundamental interests. Mr. Corbett has expressed his concerns. He says that some of them have been resolved, and some of them have not. I would say that those that the Commission was able to resolve have been resolved. What Mr. Corbett is referring to are other conditions that are not covered by the Council's decision, but which, unfortunately, we cannot go beyond.	de
"That was the opening statement by Commission President Prodi when presenting the European Commission's strategic objectives for the next five years. We look forward to the White Paper on the governance of the European Union, which will address the issue of the balance between the governments of the Member States and the institutions of the European Union and will be published this summer. On this specific point, I believe it is important that we address the reform of the Commission's internal decision-making procedures. Along with the proposals the Commission has submitted to the next Intergovernmental Conference, it has indicated its preference for smaller Member States to lose their automatic right to appoint a member of the European Commission. This is assuming the European Union has more than 25 Member States. I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built. I believe that would run counter to the spirit and purpose of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent Treaties. There must be equality in terms of national representation in the Commission, just as in the other European institutions. I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of smaller Member States to appoint a European Commissioner that the United States of America grants smaller states the same recognition in the Senate as larger states. Virtually every one of the 50 states is entitled to two seats in the United States Senate, regardless of its population. Any future reform of the European Union Treaties requires a referendum in my country. It is very difficult for those who advocate a ""yes"" vote on a future treaty of this nature to gain the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to appoint a member of the European Commission. There is no doubt that this White Paper on the governance of the European Union, which will be published this summer, will also include reform of the European Council. Once again, there are special areas at the political level that should remain within the national competence of the Member States. I don't believe there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting in areas such as taxation, justice, home affairs, and foreign affairs at the European Union level. Currently, under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome, decisions at the EU level regarding changes to the tax system must be taken unanimously. I believe this proposal should be maintained, as a common European tax code would hinder rather than benefit the functioning of the European Union. I am in favor of the enlargement of the European Union. I am in favor of institutional changes that ensure that the enlargement of the Union occurs in a streamlined and structured manner. However, we must remember that public opinion among the 370 million people in the European Union is a decisive factor in changing the EU Treaties. Changes should not be made hastily and cannot be too radical, otherwise, public opinion will make the ratification of any future Treaty on European Union very difficult."	es
It is therefore absurd and often impossible to transfer LIFE projects directly to another instrument. If alternative funding proposals were to be sought for each project, this would also require greater resources than are currently available. Now that the Commission must assess precisely what resources are needed for each action, this is an example of a non-core action requiring considerable resources that we must avoid. The Commission also cannot accept Amendment 14, which is at odds with the Commission's right of initiative. Regarding the discussion on the deadline, I would like to say that the deadline for the entry into force of LIFE, set at 31 March 2000 in the common position, must now be brought forward. This deadline will be set as soon as this regulation is adopted. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my conviction that LIFE will become an effective instrument in the context of supporting development and establishing a common environmental policy. Parliament has made a significant contribution to improving this instrument. I am sure that you share my desire to see the regulation adopted as quickly as possible, particularly given the high expectations of the Member States and other countries, especially the candidate countries, which now have the opportunity to participate in LIFE. Thank you, Mrs Wallström. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. Modernisation of social protection The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000) by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection (COM (1999) 347 - C5 - 0253/1999 - 1999/2182 (COS)). Mr President, the issue of the social protection system is of prime importance. It is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU. It is based on monetary cooperation, which has since been followed by macroeconomic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy. The logical next step is now to develop the social protection system. These areas are interdependent. Economic stability provides a basis for progress and leads to a high employment rate. It also offers the opportunity to develop well-being. However, the reverse is also true: a well-developed social protection policy can contribute to increased employment and growth. Social protection is, in other words, a productive factor. There are differences within the EU in the social protection system. Many of these stem from history. However, we now have a number of common challenges to address. This is particularly the case with demographic change, which not only concerns the increasing number of elderly people, but also the decreasing number of births. The labor market is also changing. Women are finding themselves in large numbers on the labor market. Technological developments pose another challenge. We must face these challenges together.	fr
For all these reasons, I voted in favour of the Langen report and now expect the Commission to respond to our expectations and demands. (The sitting adjourned at 1:05 p.m. and resumed at 3:00 p.m.) Oil spill in France The next item on the agenda is the Commission statement on the oil spill in France. Mrs de Palacio will speak on behalf of the Commission to open the debate. Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but also as a Breton Member who is directly affected and shocked by these events. Together with Françoise Grossetête and the PPE, we have tabled a draft resolution. Today, we are pleased to have a compromise proposal before us. The Erika tanker disaster is indeed a European matter, firstly because it has affected and polluted some of Europe's most beautiful beaches, with serious consequences for tourism, maritime professionals, and environmentalists, and secondly because it calls into question legislation and controls, which of course have European dimensions. It is safe to say that such a disaster would not have been possible off the American coast. Why? Because the Americans learned the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster and, in 1990, passed the Oil Pollution Act, which, on the one hand, contains stricter liability provisions, since it can also hold the charterer liable, and, on the other hand, is more binding and, thanks to various regulations, in particular the existence of the American Coast Guard, is better monitored. If we had such regulations, let me repeat, the disaster would undoubtedly have been avoidable. We therefore believe that the relevant provisions must be revised, particularly the 1992 Protocol, which exempted charterers, in this case the owners of oil tankers, from all liability. If charterers are exempted from liability, they are naturally less interested in the controls that fall to the oil companies. The provisions therefore need to be revised, and I thank you, Commissioner, for pointing out all the shortcomings currently existing in European regulations. Above all, as you said, we need to strengthen controls, both with regard to the flag state and with regard to ship classification societies. According to you, RINA is an Italian ship classification register recognized by the Commission. Under what conditions is this recognition granted? What are the reliability criteria? You will be sending a mission. We await the results with great interest. We also need to strengthen controls by maritime authorities and controls in European ports. As is well known, there is a Paris Memorandum that provides for a minimum level of control, according to which a quarter of the ships calling at European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned. However, this obligation is not being met, not in France and not in numerous other European countries either. Why? What conclusions has the Commission drawn from this, or does it intend to draw from it? It also seems to me necessary to strengthen the control incumbent upon the charterer, in this case the oil company. When it comes to their financial responsibility, the control will undoubtedly be somewhat more thorough.	de
"The Commission will fulfil the commitment made in Tampere to present proposals for the adoption of common definitions, incriminations and sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings, the economic exploitation of migrants, the sexual exploitation of women and children, with particular emphasis on combating the use of new media and, in particular, the Internet for the dissemination of child pornography. We have also prepared a communication and opened the debate on the tools to ensure greater security in the information and knowledge society and to combat cybercrime. The year 2000 also marks the beginning of the implementation of the European Drug Strategy 2000-2004. In this context, the Commission, in cooperation with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament, will give its full support to the Interinstitutional Conference on the Drug Problem to be held in February. As regards Schengen - and more specifically the integration of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework -, without entering into the Council's sphere of competence at this stage, I would like to point out, in relation to the topical issue of the reintroduction of border controls, that the Commission reiterates its willingness to examine in greater depth the ways in which better control of the application of Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention can be ensured, in the sense of making it more imperative. The recent reintroduction of certain internal border controls leads me to conclude that it is necessary to proceed with a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on Article 62 of the Treaty. As was underlined in Tampere, in view of the preparation of the Feira European Council in June 2000, we will have to summarise the external implications of the new dimension of home affairs and justice with a view to adopting inter-pillar political strategies which will strengthen the coordination of internal and external policy in this area and which will contribute to the affirmation of the Union in the world. I would therefore like to stress that all these actions will obviously have to take into account the principles agreed at the Helsinki European Council in relation to the candidate countries, so that they can cooperate and participate, as soon as possible, in this project of creating an area of freedom, security and justice. It is important to remember, among other things, that JHA negotiations will begin in 2000 with the first group of candidate countries and I therefore hope that we will be able to proceed with the preparation of the negotiating dossiers on the second group admitted to accession at Helsinki. Finally, I would like to reiterate that the Commission intends to take the pole position in presenting proposals to help implement the Treaty of Amsterdam. I hope that the Commission and the Council will reach an agreement on the division of responsibilities in exercising the right of initiative and in conducting the legislative process itself. As I have already said, the task before us is enormous and ambitious, so the Commission needs to be provided with the necessary human resources to meet this challenge and hopes to be able to count on the support of Parliament and - why not say it? -, of the Council to ensure these resources and objectives, so that the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice in the Union becomes a reality within the shortest possible time and so that everyone can contribute, in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, to the realisation of this project, which undoubtedly represents the ""pearl"" of the Treaty of Amsterdam."	it
Madam President, the reform process has certainly been assessed very positively, which must be acknowledged, although perhaps a little benevolently. My question: Reform will be necessary, among other reasons, because of the accession of new states and, with it, the enlargement of the Union. How can we—the Commission, Parliament, and the national parliaments of the acceding states—effectively address this challenge, taking into account the ideas and approaches of the states applying for membership? The delegations are actively working on it—I am doing so in my delegation to the Czech Republic—but it must be noted that we often maintain a very know-it-all attitude toward one another. What can reform contribute to more efficiently shaping relations and collaboration, the joint action of the European Parliament, the national parliaments, and the Commission? I thank the Honorable Member for emphasizing that, apart from its own inherent merits, reform will be necessary because of accession, enlargement, and, in particular, the kind of enlargement our Union will soon undertake. It is essential that we achieve this reform for the good of the current Union and, of course, to facilitate accessions. Over the next few years, I will continue the method I have begun to apply, together with several of my colleagues in the Commission, of course, with very in-depth discussions with the administrations of the next new Member States. We do this to try to explain as fully as possible the system they will enter. I would also like to see the enrichment of the training work undertaken by current Member States and by the Union in general to ensure that, as new officials arrive at the Commission and Member State officials and administrators have to deal with the realities, the complex realities, of accession to the Union and the Single Market, it is difficult to see the seams. That is the level of refinement and performance I would like. All I can do now is promise that I will strive to achieve it. Let me begin by wishing the Commissioner a happy St. David's Day. Thank you for his presentation. It is important that the Commission never lose sight of the fact that if the reform process does not reconnect with the European public, it will be an utter and pointless waste of time. That must truly be the focus at all times. It has to provide a service to them, and of course, the recommendations on reducing payment delays will be very welcome—I am sure—but the other major complaint we receive from the citizens we represent concerns paperwork. Excessive paperwork. Is there any reference to reducing paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants for European funding while still ensuring financial control? That is the clear complaint we receive, and it must be addressed. The other question I would like to ask concerns the Audit Committee. It is certainly welcome, but it is essential that there be a reference to the oversight of recommendations from the European Parliament in our discharge procedure.	es
Soon, in May, the European Commission plans to present a communication on developing the role of human rights and democratisation in the Union's external relations. I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to take account of this need for coordination and to seek new formulas that will strengthen the role played by the European Union and especially by Parliament in the field of human rights, especially in terms of coherence, recognising the goodwill of third countries that agree to include the democracy clause. This commitment should be translated into all respects, and I am referring in particular to the budget. Lastly, I would like to highlight the important contributions that civil society can make in this area and also the role, often underestimated, of the many non-governmental organisations working in the field. The Union must commit itself to providing them with all the support they need to carry out their important mission. Mr President, Members of the Commission, when this House is called upon to discuss the issue of human rights, it runs a serious risk which, if you like, is also underlined by the climate in which we are called upon to discuss this very important issue. The absence of the Council and of almost all of Parliament's colleagues makes us understand how much space there is still between noble, lofty and useful declarations on a formal level and the concrete application of the issue of human rights in the field of everyday politics. I believe that this Parliament, starting with the contribution that the European Union will give to the Geneva meeting, is called to fill this space and to make a contribution, not only on the level of the enunciation of principles but also on that of truth and even loyalty. Human rights must escape an interpretation that is only linked to the moment of denunciation or the moment of punishment. We are called, as a Parliament, to address the issue of human rights above all on the level of prevention. In this sense, we must be able to export a culture of legality, a culture of law, a convenience of law. I believe that a long period in which treaties and signatures were added to treaties has definitively ended. Today we have many, perhaps too many, treaties that intervene on the issue of human rights: if these treaties remain mere enunciation, they are only useless places of thought. Today we must move on to a subsequent and necessary phase, which is that of the daily and binding application of what is written in our treaties, even if we must not forget that some fundamental treaties still need to be implemented: I am referring to the Rome Conference and the fact that 14 out of 15 countries of the Union have not yet ratified the treaty on the International Criminal Court. I believe that we must verify and modify some political instruments by which we measure the quality of human rights on the planet. We have often used instruments that, on a formal level, may be comfortable but which, on the level of political outcome, are absolutely useless: I am referring to the use, and often the abuse, that has been made of the embargo over the years and to the overly cautious application of the suspension clause of agreements between the European Union and third countries, in the event that human rights are violated in these countries.	it
I can tell you that, in the context of the negotiations currently underway on the third Community Support Framework, I have asked for the provisions relating to the partnership principle to be fully respected, including for regional and local authorities and also for everything that concerns non-governmental organisations and associations. This principle must therefore be translated, in the context of the third CSF, in particular by the participation of all these partners in the follow-up committee. That, honourable Member, is the answer I can give you. I thank the Commissioner; I do not dispute his intentions and his actions in any way, which have moved in the right direction. However, things are very different. A centralising hand hovers over the Community Support Framework, so much so that in this era, on the question of European Union funding, we are witnessing a form of State, government and party delirium. I cannot show you certain television programmes here, but I can read you the Greek newspapers a few weeks before the elections. It was in the Sunday papers all over Greece: The Ministry of Public Works and Structural Funds: the work of the Minister; Ministry of Agriculture: the work carried out by the Minister of Agriculture - a few weeks before the elections -; Ministry of Telecommunications: the work carried out by the Minister of Telecommunications; Ministry of Education: the work carried out by the Ministry of Education, complete with a photograph of the Minister; Ministry of Employment: the work of the Ministry of Employment, complete with a photograph of the Minister, a photograph of the Deputy Minister and, behind all this, the symbol of the Community Support Framework. The elections are only a few weeks away. Parties and candidates are advertising themselves with funds from the European Union, from the Community Support Framework. I ask the Commissioner: what do we want to do? Will the Commission remain silent? Does it intend to discuss it? Will it raise the issue with the Greek Government or will we once again fall into the pathological situations of the previous Commission? Mr Alavanos, I saw that you were throwing all the documents you mentioned to your left. I would like you to give them to me so that I can read them - once translated - to see how much of them correspond to information, to communication, which I can only be happy about as Commissioner responsible for regional policy, and how much to propaganda. And then, if it is really necessary, I will make some observations or recommendations to the Greek Government. So I would be very happy, Mr President, if you would give me the documents, otherwise I will go and look for them on the floor of your group's benches. Having said that, I thought your question was more about partnership. Apart from the issues related to the pre-election period that you mentioned, I repeat that I am keen for local and regional authorities to participate together with non-governmental organisations. But I cannot even write something different from the text of the general regulation on the Structural Funds, which provides that the Commission will work with the governments of the Member States and that I will have the Greek Government as a partner, as my first partner. After that I will have to make sure that the partnership is widespread, decentralised, and I will make sure of that. I can do nothing but work with the Greek Government.	it
"I will only mention here the wine and other goods produced in the Golan Heights and the occupied territories. Peace reigns in Palestine and Israel. Credibility and respect for the legality of treaties and agreements are essential if the European Union and Parliament intend to play an active political role. Israel is certain that Europe supports the security and stability of its state, but cannot ask us to be complicit in such serious violations. The Palestinians know that the European Union supports the affirmation of their state and their rights, but they need confirmation of this. Peace is not built on the violation of rights. Some Israelis, like the soldier Igal Moshe, who refused four days ago to leave for Lebanon and is now in prison, and some Palestinians, like those who have been refugees for 50 years and who, despite the demolition of their homes and their lives, want peace, are of the same opinion. It is above all respect for ourselves and for the democratic rules we have set for ourselves that demands this of us. Allow me to say, more prosaically, that this also concerns the loss of income for European citizens resulting from this violation of human and economic rights. Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, Mrs Morgantini, the questions that the Commission has formulated concern possible illegal exports to the European Community of products from Israeli settlements or occupied territories that benefit from preferential treatment and, consequently, call into question the correct application of the rules of preferential origin. The Commission has already given a written answer to a question from Mrs Morgantini on this subject in January 2000. However, Mrs Morgantini would like to obtain additional information. I will therefore endeavour to provide it to her. Firstly, when you refer to the lack of clarity in the agreement, I can tell you that the interim agreement on trade and related matters between the European Community and Israel specifies that it applies to the territory of the Member States of the European Community and, I quote, ""to the territory of Israel"". And that, therefore, from the perspective of the European Union, it is quite clear, in view of the clarifications set out in the written reply of Commissioner Christopher Patten, which I will read to you in the original language: ""... as already explained in the communication, the Community cannot consider Israeli settlements or the occupied territories as part of Israeli territory for the purpose of implementing the EC-Israel agreement. This is a very sensitive issue because it relates to the wider question of borders, to Israelis and to Palestinians."" We have repeatedly made this position known to the Israeli authorities during all official meetings between the Commission and the Israeli Minister, the most recent being on 21 January, when Prime Minister Shimon Peres met with Commission President Romano Prodi and Commissioner Christopher Patten. And as the Member has just pointed out, it is well known that Israel's interpretation of the territorial scope of the agreement does not coincide with the European Union's interpretation, but, from the Commission's point of view, our interpretation is unambiguous."	fr
In other words, experts are increasingly convinced that climate change and, in general, human activities are linked to the increase in natural disasters in recent years. In fact, temperatures have risen more in the last decade than in the rest of the entire century. That is why Europe must make a clear commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and promote concrete proposals. Secondly, I was rapporteur on the issue of civil protection in Europe, and I completely agree with the Commissioner when he proposes to create a European civil protection corps. Furthermore, given that this is an extraordinary disaster situation, an extraordinary budget line must be used. First of all, we would like to express our solidarity with the families who have lost loved ones in this terrible tragedy and with their communities. It is precisely the loss of human life that makes this disaster so extraordinary for Europe. It is regrettable that we do not have an instrument to provide assistance in such circumstances. I thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on this matter and for suggesting that we should organise ourselves at European level to provide assistance to Member States and regions affected by such tragedies: that is important. Another thing we must bear in mind is that in the past we had a budget line, limited indeed, which was certainly not enough to do much, but which on several occasions was exploited by Members of this Parliament to propose interventions even in cases of minor disasters. Officials and ministers from the Member States would go to Brussels, have a private chat with the Commission, get a handful of euros and boast about the political achievement of being able to stand in their constituencies with the aid they had received. That is to say that the budget line in question was not very popular when it was abolished. I believe that this budget line should be reinstated. During the earthquake in Greece, a major disaster, the Community had no instrument to show its solidarity and sympathy for the Greek people in the same way as it did during the floods in France and this latest disaster. These are major disasters, we should have some kind of instrument, but we do not, so we should reinstate it and adopt strict rules so that it can only be used in the event of a major disaster. The funds saved could be carried forward from year to year so that we have an instrument of intervention in the event of a particularly serious event. This time Ireland has not been badly affected, despite several strong windstorms in the Atlantic. We have also had floods in Ireland and I would like to express my solidarity with the Irish people who have been affected. Ladies and gentlemen, we should not have short memories. It is true that the Council and Parliament have jointly decided to abolish the budget line for emergency aid. It is also true that there is a lot of European money, as Commissioner Barnier has indicated: for oyster farming and agriculture, Article 30 of the Regulation on rural development would be used, for forestry, Article 33; for businesses, the derogations provided for in competition law in Article 87(2) of the Treaty; for public structures, the Structural Funds.	it
I oppose Amendments 7 to 13, which were resolutely rejected by the Committee on Fisheries. Their content, for the most part, is unnecessary or is already mentioned in my text. In particular, I drew attention to the need to study the extent and effects of the interaction between farmed and wild salmon, the need to study the source of ISA, and the need to carry out more widespread testing of the virus in wild fish stocks. These amendments tabled by the Green component of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance seek to provide a justification for Amendment 13. This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate, given that it not only seeks to maintain the obligation for the mandatory and immediate slaughter of all fish, but also seeks to prevent any fish from an infected farm, whether diseased or not, from being sold, and I must emphasize that, in accordance with current policy, no diseased fish are sold. No proposals are being made to change this situation, and under the proposed new regime, there is no question of selling diseased fish. Amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take into account the reality demonstrated by the starkly contrasting statistics provided by Scotland and Norway. In Scotland, we have endured a draconian regime that has failed to achieve its objectives. In Norway, thanks to their longer experience, compulsory culling was abandoned some years ago, and a series of measures have led to the situation improving dramatically. It is in all our interests that in Scotland, we too can contain ISA and prevent its further spread. Last week, in Scotland, a joint ISA working group, made up of government and industry representatives, published a report. This comprehensive document considers a wide range of potential risks and recommends actions to address them in areas such as site-to-site transmission, safety measures to reduce leakage, waste and effluent treatment, detection and diagnostic methods, farrowing and rotation, disinfection of equipment, and many other measures. Some measures can and will be immediately implemented by local authorities using existing powers, and others will be included in codes of practice. All will be beneficial, not only in relation to ISA but also in driving higher standards in aquaculture generally, where this is needed. Colleagues, your vote in favour of my report as a whole and as adopted by the Fisheries Committee will be an important part of a wider package of measures concerning the control of ISA, based on the reality of the situation in Scotland and the lessons learned from the successes achieved by other countries. I congratulate Mr. Hudghton, I fully support his report, and I urge honourable Members of Parliament to do the same. As he mentioned, fish farming provides a crucial source of employment in the most remote parts of rural Scotland, and at a time when rural Scotland is suffering the worst recession in over a century, the aquaculture industry provides a vital boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of jobs depend, directly or indirectly. As he mentioned, over 85,000 tonnes of salmon are produced by Scottish farms in a sector that generates over €800 million each year.	fr
Will the European Union be able to take a united position for the first time and develop a common policy in the face of such a complex problem? We also wonder whether the European Union has learned the lessons from the negative experience in Bosnia and the slightly more positive experience in Kosovo in terms of aid. Will we be able to achieve better results in the light of what has been learned in Macedonia and in four other countries? Given the particularly ambitious expectations, I do not think it is too much to say that this first step, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, is of crucial importance. This is not the only contribution of the European Union. There will soon be a debate on the Stability Pact, the CARA programme and short-term financing. The issue now under discussion is the Stabilisation and Association Agreements, which are a medium-term perspective. That is why I think this first agreement with Macedonia is so important, because it is a model. I am convinced that the other four countries are wondering what will happen. What will the European Union do with Macedonia? And will the same fate be reserved for the other four countries? That is why I believe that this first step, this model, is of crucial importance. Macedonia is a model for another reason too. The rapporteur has already mentioned this very clearly. It concerns inter-ethnic relations. In this respect we must not construct an overly idealised version of the situation. It became clear during the presidential elections that difficulties remain, but, compared to the rest of the region, Macedonia could still be considered a model. There are many advantages to be gained if we succeed, together with the Macedonians, in exporting this model to the rest of the Western Balkans. The same model also applies to regional cooperation. I fully agree with the rapporteur when he says that a balance must be found between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand, and maintaining openness to Bulgaria and Greece on the other, avoiding any closure. Mr President, Commissioner, if we succeed in taking this first step correctly, there will be many advantages to be gained. If we waste this opportunity, the damage will be even greater. Mr President, first of all, let me say that I have no difficulty in endorsing this well-reasoned report in principle. I would simply like to point out one point which I believe is missing from the report and which constitutes a serious problem for Macedonia and for the effectiveness of financial and other support from the Union. I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia. In order to avoid any misunderstanding, I too believe that vigorous opposition to the Milosevic regime is necessary. But firstly, the sanctions also have a serious and negative impact on many neighbouring countries, including Macedonia, which are already in an extremely critical economic situation. Secondly, in violation of the humanitarian perspective and with counterproductive political effects, the entire Yugoslav population is being held responsible for the misdeeds of Milosevic and his henchmen.	it
I think it was important that everyone attached particular importance to the role of the European Union in development policy on an international scale. Everyone recognizes, and this was the subject of today's debate, that the European Union must necessarily strengthen the coherence of its various policies which contribute to development objectives in order to assume a more active and leading role in development policy internationally. I think that some of those who have spoken have also made it very clear that this responsibility for the coherence of European Union policies does not lie solely with the Council, the Commission, or even with Parliament. Rather, it must be the subject of concerted effort, reflection, and legislative and institutional preparation, both at Commission and Council level, and in the European Parliament itself. Moreover, some Members have put forward proposals in this regard, such as the creation of an observatory or working group to monitor the actions of the various policy areas in the specific field of development. Finally, I would like to stress the importance of recalling, as this was a key element of the Portuguese Presidency's programme, the statement on the need to give greater prominence to development policy in conjunction with the European Union's other policies, and particularly within its external policy. We consider this absolutely essential, because we will not be able to develop consistent measures in the area of policy coherence if we are unable to give development policy the importance it deserves as an instrument for affirming the principles and values that shape Europe's image in the international system. To do this, it may be necessary, as I have already said, to undertake a paradigm shift, to move beyond the post-colonial paradigm and to give development policy a wider European dimension. In this respect, I believe (and this has also been expressed in some of the comments made here) that the adoption of the new agreement, which will replace the Lomé Conventions, provides an important tool for renewing and giving new impetus to the concept of partnership with such a significant group of countries in the South, at a time when there is considerable and tangible instability in the negotiating processes at international level, such as the first round in Seattle. I detect a certain frustration in many of the contributions to this debate. On behalf of the Commission, I have presented you with a statement which I believe provides useful background information for this discussion. We will be submitting more detailed information in due course, dealing specifically with all the issues of coherence. This discussion is not new. We are currently working on it in the Commission, and when this work is completed, we will report on it, as many have asked for the report on coherence. I have no doubt that the increasing political attention being given to these problems, as has also been made clear in today's debate, will make it easier for the Commission and DG Development to give coherence the highest priority in the agenda of the tasks ahead.	de
This element of inflationary resurgence can be especially significant if it ends up generating cost-push inflation, which is why we always speak of the need for a wage policy compatible with the definitions of inflation we wish to propose. Parliament, in its analyses, has highlighted another issue: the evolution of stock market risk. From the Commission's point of view, this is significant, although we do not believe it is the substantial problem. In any case, I would like to emphasize that we currently have excellent opportunities to do more. I think we all agree that, after a decade of very weak growth and intolerable unemployment, there are some things to be done. There is a lack of public and private investment. Our research and development levels are too low compared to our competitors, and we have a low employment rate that reflects, among other factors, the imbalances in our labor market. Our objective must therefore be to make this economic recovery a lasting period of strong growth and job creation. Job creation remains the Commission's fundamental objective, as we reflected in the Prodi document, which was sent for debate at the Lisbon Summit, insofar as we are committed to full employment in the medium term. What policy should we implement to achieve these objectives? In our opinion, the Union is experiencing a period of economic recovery, but there is still unused production capacity. Not only the use of physical capital but also, above all, new sources of employment. The policy mix we implement should precisely allow for the full absorption of this capacity. We must define a macroeconomic policy that supports growth. It is true that this is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth's sake; it is simply a budgetary policy that can be consistent with price stability, but that also allows us to implement an appropriate monetary policy that facilitates growth. And this policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will facilitate growth. The Union's growth potential, in our opinion, must pay special attention to certain factors. I believe that on most of them we agree with the analysis carried out by Parliament. First, it is essential to facilitate private investment. The Union must contribute to fostering entrepreneurship and generating employment through this means, but public investment must not be forgotten. Public investment has been the great sinker of recent years, and an improvement in public finances must clearly allow us to improve public investment, which must be done, however, while respecting our commitments to fiscal consolidation. Our major commitment for the future must be to research and development and human capital. These are two of the major challenges we face for Lisbon. We believe it is essential to advance these challenges with quantified objectives, with specific definitions that will ultimately allow us to achieve what we all aim for: clear improvements in productivity that make possible greater growth in our society, with job growth that closes some of the gap we have lost in recent years. This is the policy that, as a Commission, we have defended and will continue to defend in Lisbon. Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) The following reports are now under joint debate:	es
Fourth and final aspect I would like to submit to your consideration, necessarily regarding this aspect of development policies: the role of the Development Council. The role that the Development Council can play within the framework of Union policies has been examined, particularly in recent months. It is well known that the difference in status between development and other policies at the Union level is glaring—one need only look at the difficult conditions under which the budgeting or non-budgetization of the EDF has been raised—and it is difficult to accept that we can instill greater coherence in European Union policies without a more active role and greater involvement of the Development Council in advising on political decisions that are eminently related to the sphere of development and that are adopted in other Councils, in other decision-making centers, ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Councils, but in relation to which the Development Council has so far had no opportunity to be heard or to intervene. Therefore, without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decisions which, while directly affecting the European Union's development policy, are adopted outside its decision-making centre, it will undoubtedly be difficult to implement a policy of greater European Union coherence in relation to development objectives. In this regard, too, the words and reflections of the European Parliament will be timely and will be welcomed as such. To begin with, I would like to say something about the negotiations between the EU and the ACP countries, which have concluded successfully. I must say that participating in those negotiations was an extremely positive experience. I was able to see the Member States working as a team, which is a truly rewarding experience. Both parties were deeply satisfied when the negotiations were over, not only because they were over, but because we all knew that we had achieved something in common, the EU and the 71 ACP countries. This is something the world needs and represents a very positive signal in the context of the debates on globalization. I would like to highlight some of the main innovations of the new agreement. We explicitly addressed corruption; we established a framework for addressing the immigration problem for the first time. We promoted participatory approaches and established civil society consultations on reforms and policies the EU will support. We refocused development policies on poverty reduction strategies. We based the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country's needs but also on the results of its policies. We created an investment facility to support private sector development. We streamlined instruments and introduced a new rolling programming system, allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programs. We decentralized administrative, and in some cases, financial, responsibilities to the local level to make cooperation more effective. We improved the regulatory framework for trade and investment development. We promoted cooperation in all areas of relevance to trade, including emerging issues such as labor standards and the links between the environment and trade.	es
"In this case, Mr President, we certainly have a decalogue. A whole series of problems have been cited but, with all due respect, it seems that the Commission, in a way, does not dare to say ""we should act like this"" for any of them. It seems to me that you have only insisted - and even too much in my opinion - on one point, namely the fact that little by little the objective that you consider a priority is to dismantle ""superfluous"" activities. However, we are attentive, Mr President, because we have experienced a crisis of confidence in the Commission and we have counted on this Commission - at least the majority of this Parliament - precisely so that, above all, the reform of the Commission would be accompanied by a strengthening, a new identity, a feeling of being once again led by a watchful hand. Let us take the fact that the Commission wants to dismantle or proposes to dismantle, not considering itself up to the task, for example, of the powers conferred on it by the Treaty to implement common policies. What are we asking, in a certain sense, of a government? What are we asking of this, so to speak, ambiguous and particular structure that is the European Community? It is good that common resources have a supranational government and that they are not delegated to the Member States or the TAOs, as has happened in the past. I find that you are submitting the same menu to us, but in a more serious way, by limiting yourself, as you say, to the duties of designing some White Paper, as you have proposed to us. I fear - even if you are shaking your head, Mr President - that this will translate into what some countries have been thinking for years, that is to say, that the Commission must be a good secretariat for the Council of Ministers. If this is the role the Commission intends to assume over the next five years, we, as committed federalists, are certain that it is not the right path to follow. We will challenge you and judge what the Commission intends to do. The reform is important, but if it leads to a degradation, a reduction, and a diminution of the Commission's supranational powers, the future of European integration, the future that the founding fathers envisioned for the European Commission, will be at stake. As for the other points, Mr. President, I would raise, for example, that of economic and social policy. Certainly, the European social model is experiencing a serious crisis; certainly, unemployment is, and this is no coincidence, a problem that none of our policies has managed to resolve. But it is not certain that we will be able to resolve unemployment by drawing up the list of problems we have spoken about in the past, without having a clear vision, without a proposal, the one that means that there are economies in Europe that are moving at one of the fastest paces and which are, and this is no coincidence, those that have been able to make flexibility in the labour market and in business their number one objective."	fr
I can only reiterate this. It is absolutely important to involve the public with adequate information and a consultation procedure. This is also reiterated in recital 14. I would like to say to Mr Bowe that he, just like my Scottish colleague, will be able to continue enjoying a glass of Scotch whisky from time to time with a clear conscience. The Commission has not found it necessary to regulate the very limited water consumption required for whisky production. I would now like to comment in a little more detail on some of the issues under consideration. Limiting the release of hazardous substances into water must be one of the most important objectives. I am pleased to see that the amendments tabled by Parliament focus on this aspect. The Commission fully supports the proposal to include the commitments of the OSPAR Convention in the text. However, their exact content and scope must be adhered to. As I have already said, the objective and the timetable of the OSPAR Convention are above all a political commitment. The introduction of a legally binding timetable would not be in line with this commitment. However, it must be ensured that the Member States and the Community are obliged to take action to achieve those targets and to stick to the timetable. I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88. The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 19, which defines dangerous substances differently from the OSPAR Convention. The Commission proposal introduces a clear procedure for the selection of substances, which makes a definition unnecessary. Although I myself agree with the content of Amendments Nos 79 and 106, these amendments go beyond the commitments under the OSPAR Convention. I cannot therefore accept them. The Commission can also accept in principle Amendment No 60, which requires a timetable for the Commission proposal on the restriction of priority substances. Amendment No 59 introduces the requirement for a constant review of the list of priority substances. However, this would lead to legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and therefore the amendment cannot be accepted. The request, in Amendments 60 and 93, for a guide list and a list of substances for which sufficient data are not available cannot be accepted. Such lists would have an uncertain legal status and would not fit in with the procedures for the adoption of the priority list. In this respect, I would like to underline that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way amend existing Community legislation on nitrates from agricultural activities. The Nitrates Directive will therefore not be affected by this Framework Directive. I appreciate the fact that Parliament has shown flexibility on the very sensitive and difficult issue of water pricing. I fully support the request for the price of water to be set at a level that provides an incentive to use water resources sustainably. I also support the request for an adequate contribution from each sector to cover its costs. I can therefore accept in part and in principle Amendments Nos 43-46 and Amendment No.	it
I would like to draw your attention to one thing: it is dangerous to re-design the entire governance of the European Union from here. I would clearly advocate subsidiarity. If we are able to define the scope of our governance, that would be very positive, in my view. Moreover, I believe that subsidiarity also deserves consideration. It cannot be just the Commission; it must be our states, our parliaments, and our civil society that also reflect on it. Finally, I would like to briefly address the last objective, which we consider absolutely fundamental: the stabilization of the continent and the strengthening of Europe's role in the world. Here, I would say that there is agreement and support regarding the priority of South-Eastern Europe, regarding enlargement and—as I have already mentioned—the integration process and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean program, as well as our capacity for conflict prevention, and regarding an issue that is very little discussed: the North-South challenge. We must not forget Africa, the continent completely abandoned not only by God but also by Europe, nor our important contribution to development cooperation. Finally, an issue in which we, as the world's most important economic and trading power, bear increasing responsibility: the European Union's voice in the world. This does not only mean a proactive stance with regard to the Millennium Round. It means reforming the United Nations and the international financial institutions, in which Europe bears enormous responsibility. And above all, and I conclude with this, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we must be able to express this in understandable and clear language, by changing, to some extent, the jargon we use. We cannot expect Europeans, who are living through times of profound change, to join us and share our enthusiasm if we continue to use a very difficult-to-understand language and turn our backs on them. This is the most important means of increasing and strengthening trust, which, in any case, I hope, will be measured in the next European elections. Mr President of the Commission, first of all, on behalf of my group, I would like to assure you that we share your starting point and support the core of the analysis and strategy you have presented in this House today, namely that Europe is facing major and clearly political challenges. Political because we are in a process of further development. Even if the economic building blocks are still being worked on, we are leaving the purely functional entity of Europe behind and turning to a political perspective marked by greater challenges. Enlargement is a challenge of a political nature. The task of creating an area of cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs and tackling the problems of asylum, immigration, and crime is also deeply political. This also applies to the implementation of a common security and defense policy. It is precisely the political nature of these tasks that makes them complex to solve. This political nature means that questions of sovereignty are involved, which in turn makes citizens and voters more sensitive.	de
Sixth and last: we proclaim that ETA's terrorism and violence must disappear and that it must stop hijacking the will of the Basque citizens, who, freely and without violent coercion, must be able to decide on their future. Just three months ago, I spoke in this House, like many other Members, to congratulate the Irish and British on their success in reaching the Northern Ireland agreement. In Northern Ireland, too many people have been killed and injured in the last thirty years... too many families torn apart. Until now, and unfortunately, precisely the opposite has happened in Spain and France with regard to the ongoing conflict in the Basque Country. We, the Basque Country, are convinced that a definitive solution to the current struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation without a limited agenda. Before January 20, for nineteen months, the only violent death we witnessed in the Kingdom of Spain was that of José Luis Geresta, a member of ETA, in March 1999. Despite this and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, including those of ETA negotiators with the agreement of the Spanish Government, ETA respected the unilateral ceasefire. Then, last November, before the ceasefire ended, the Spanish Government spokesperson, Mr. Piqué, declared that his Government had done and would do in the future everything possible to hinder current initiatives aimed at achieving a political solution in the Basque Country. We, the Basque Country, have on many occasions lamented the loss of human life. We share with all Basque citizens the suffering of our people. We are committed to dialogue and ready to collaborate with all those eager to find a democratic solution for the Basque Country. Twenty years have passed since the question of Northern Ireland was first raised in this Parliament. Allow me to ask: Quosque tandem - Noiz arte? Madam President, thank you very much for giving me the floor. I swear I'm having trouble speaking now, after the speech I just heard. When my colleague Mr. Alonso Puerta mentioned some of ETA's victims, he did not name—and I believe he did so out of respect for me—a person whom ETA killed 16 years ago. A Socialist senator, also a Basque parliamentarian, whose name was Enrique Casas. (Loud applause) Madam President, Senator Enrique Casas was my husband. I was widowed with four children, the youngest of whom was eight months old. The only fault my husband had—he was Andalusian by birth, a Basque senator, sent by the Basque Government to defend the Basque Country in Madrid—was that he was a socialist, but above all a democrat, nothing more than a democrat. I myself, Madam President, have never spoken about this in this Assembly. Only on the day ETA declared the truce did I welcome it as a hope for the entire Basque people, for all of Spain and Europe.	es
the Council statement on the European Union's position on developments in the Cyprus question; the report (A4-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of measures in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta (COM(1999)0535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)). Mr Seixas da Costa will speak on behalf of the Council. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I would like to provide some information regarding the resumption of the inter-Cypriot negotiations and the latest developments on this issue. I think it is obvious to everyone that what happened in Helsinki at the end of last year, as well as the new climate, particularly noticeable in relations between the European Union and Turkey, reflects a background at Community level from which the very framework of relations between the two communities in Cyprus itself cannot remain unaffected. I would like to stress that, at the beginning of December last year, the first new round of negotiations between the Cypriot communities of the north and south of the island took place in New York after several years of interruption. These rounds of negotiations were indirect discussions mediated by the United Nations Special Representative, Álvaro de Souto. A second round of talks followed in January of this year, opening on 31 January, and a third round is scheduled to begin on 23 May in New York. There is a possibility, although this has not yet been definitively confirmed, that these talks could take place directly and continuously, with work continuing until September of this year. Four main issues were addressed during this discussion: questions of security, government structure, territorial adjustment, and the refugee and compensation issues resulting from the situation following the island's division. However, since it was agreed that it would be possible to include further issues, Rauf Denktash, the representative of the northern part of the island, proposed three new topics: the question of sovereignty, the question of confidence-building measures, and the question of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island. Two main developments have emerged in the discussions so far: The possibility of establishing a direct information channel between the European Union and the northern part of the island is emerging, without this necessarily implying recognition of this part of the island as an entity with its own legal personality at the international level. The goal is to facilitate the adoption of the acquis communautaire in the event of a possible accession of the entire island, should the global problem of the island's division be resolved in the meantime. The second development that we consider important is the statement by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the end of the first day of talks, in which he assured that a comprehensive settlement of the situation would entail recognition of the specific characteristics of the northern part of the island. This position expressed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations is a factor that must naturally be taken into account in our future analysis.	de
This is an important step towards a European natural judge (which is one of our aspirations), based on mutual trust between Member States and between their respective judicial systems, on the trust of European citizens towards any European judge, but also on scrupulous respect for fundamental freedoms and rights and, in particular, procedural guarantees. It is on this point that Parliament has rightly changed - in my opinion - the balance proposed by the Council, with a clear and resolute strengthening of these procedural guarantees in all its amendments. Mr President, as the rapporteur has pointed out, Parliament has paid particular attention to one issue, that of telephone interceptions, which it has decided to delete. On behalf of the European People's Party, I have tabled an amendment to the resolution calling on the Council to propose a text on the matter as soon as possible, since the absence of regulation is harmful. The regulation submitted to us was incomplete, and therefore inadequate. However, the absence of rules could also lead - and in fact has often led - to abuses in the telecommunications sector. Another point on which I would like to dwell, also widely discussed, concerns the use of videoconferences in the case of persons under investigation, accused, indicted or on trial. On this issue too, I have asked, on behalf of the European People's Party, that the Council draw up a convention as soon as possible to clarify and complete the legislation, which is clearly insufficient. Mr President, we members of the European People's Party, with a few exceptions, will vote in favour of the amendments approved in committee and, obviously, in favour of the amendments that we ourselves have presented. Mr President, part of the construction of Europe passes, in our opinion, through the construction of a common legal system that includes administrative law, civil law, substantive and procedural, and criminal law, substantive and procedural, of the Europe that we want to build. The Convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, which we are examining today, is only one piece of this great European corpus juris, which finds its natural foundation in fundamental human rights and freedoms. Therefore, judicial and criminal cooperation must also take place in the strictest respect for fundamental rights, principles that are the basis of our culture and our civilization: I am thinking of due process, in particular the rights of defense, the impartiality and third-party nature of the judge, the length of judicial procedures for which my country, Italy, unfortunately holds a negative record with regard to the number of convictions, of cases pending before the European Court of Human Rights. The limitations of fundamental rights, which are justified because they are linked to a real or presumed violation of the criminal law, cannot and must not find application in the fields of law. The report that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has largely modified with respect to the original approach, accepting many amendments presented by us, still raises some doubts, linked to the way in which it intends to regulate telephone interceptions and videoconferences.	it
However, the Court of Justice has not explicitly addressed the issue of visas and residence permits; consequently, the Member States have not been able to clarify these issues either. Moreover, the Member States have not complied with the Court's provisions on the abolition of work permits, and to this day they are placing unacceptable obstacles to the provision of cross-border services, which are often insurmountable, especially for small businesses. As regards self-employed workers, the current Community legal acquis does not provide for third-country nationals to provide services across the border. Legislative action is therefore necessary. Both draft directives aim to facilitate the freedom to provide services by EU businesses. They do not concern the original rights of third-country nationals that can be traced back to freedom of movement. All regulations, entry into the Community and questions of residence must be considered in relation to the freedom to provide services. Like the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market of the European Parliament, I am therefore of the opinion that the legal basis chosen by the Commission is the right one, while I do not find the opinion expressed in the expert report of the Council's legal service valid. Therefore, in my opinion, there are no well-founded legal arguments that could prevent these two draft directives from proceeding expeditiously through the Council. I also believe that the amendments proposed by Parliament to the Commission's proposal should help the Council to approve the directives. Many of our amendments are linked to concerns that have also emerged in the Council; and we are therefore trying to reconcile these concerns with the mandate that we derive from the legislation currently in force and from economic considerations. I can only appeal to the Commission to adopt, if possible in their entirety, the amendments accepted by Parliament, even where they differ considerably from the Commission's original proposals. I am deeply convinced that on this basis we will be able to find an agreement more easily in the Council. And now let's move on to the most important amendments proposed by us. One of the substantial differences is this: the current proposal refers to a system that provides for the issuing of a service provision card and requires the indication of each individual task performed. Well, we propose to abolish the obligation to declare each individual task to the host State as it appears difficult to implement in practice. As a counterpart, of course, any potential difficulty must be resolved before the aforementioned card is issued. We therefore propose to make the requirements for its issuing more stringent. Evidence of regular employment, legal residence and insurance coverage must not only be provided at the time of issuing the card but also during its entire validity and for the three months thereafter. In this way, the host State is assured that the employed or self-employed worker, once the task has been completed, will actually return to the State of origin and that in the event of illness or injury they will have insurance coverage.	it
Furthermore, there are problems of a different nature within the regions. It is clear that it is primarily the local and regional authorities - and, consequently, to a lesser extent the national authorities - that are best placed to assess the situation and formulate an appropriate policy. I cannot therefore support the idea of delegating competences to the European level in this respect. Nor should we forget employment policy in general. Here too, the structure of the economy differs in the various Member States and the same applies to the ways in which the current level of employment has been achieved. It is not appropriate to apply a single type of policy, perhaps with many derogations and adjustments. This would mean that the European Union is unfairly taking competences away from the Member States and that the Brussels bureaucracy is needlessly interposing between the two sides. It is better for the Member States themselves to take measures to promote employment. They know the situation better than the Commission. For this reason, I am reluctant to formulate Community measures to promote employment, including in the tourism sector. It is totally unacceptable for us that Parliament should seek to achieve this objective indirectly by extending its powers. Mr President, you will understand that we cannot vote in favour of the resolution in its current form. First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Viceconte on the work he has done on the report, a very thorough document which we support, just as we supported the original report on which the document is based, that of the High Level Group set up by the European Commission. I hope that the Commission will not forget the Group it has set up and that it will make use of it and not leave it lying idle in a corner. The tourism sector is essentially a small business and is therefore a fertile area for job creation. As has already been said in the debate, three million potential jobs within the next ten years is a goal worth pursuing. Europe can no longer refuse to give the fastest growing sector of its economy the recognition it deserves because of its economic and social position, and it must do so both politically and through appropriate measures. We need a more dynamic vision, based on the contribution of tourism to job creation. We need to recognise that the sector is predominantly a cross-border business and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating, innovative and proactive approach aimed at sustainable business development. I know that the Commissioner is a computer enthusiast, and I must say that he has rubbed off on me too. Well, tourism and computer science are two sectors that go very well together. There are therefore many reasons why the tourism industry can be considered as an ideal testing ground for integrating job creation strategies. Let us look at these reasons in detail. The importance of tourism for the economy and its growth potential is clear. Various sections of the population work in the tourism sector, in particular the most vulnerable groups such as young people, women and unskilled workers.	it
Each chairperson has as many votes as the group has members. There was a vote on this point. As I recall, the outcome of this vote was as follows: 422 to 180, with a few abstentions. That means that all groups, with the exception of the non-attached members—but they are not a group—agreed; only your group was of the opinion that we should proceed as you proposed here. All the others disagreed. That was the decision. Now I would like to say something about the matter itself. We have confidence in the Commission, in Romano Prodi, and the vast majority of our group, as everyone knows, expressed its confidence in Romano Prodi and the Commission after a difficult process. But we also believe that we must conduct a debate on this Commission strategy in an orderly manner, not just on the basis of an oral statement here in the European Parliament, but also on the basis of a document adopted by the Commission and describing this program for five years. There is no such document! The Commission will present the programme for 2000 in February. We said, OK, if the Commission doesn't want to draw up the 2000 programme in January, then we'll do it in February. We agreed to this. We don't really want to argue with the Commission; rather, we believe that, if at all possible, the Commission and Parliament should go down a common path. But we as Parliament are also the Commission's controller. And not everything that comes out of the Commission has to be our opinion. I want us to be able to prepare properly for a debate on the five-year programme in the parliamentary groups. You can't prepare when you hear a statement here and have no idea what such a statement contains. That is why we recommend – and I have the impression that the Commission is also open to this idea – that we hold the debate in February on the Commission's long-term programme up to 2005 – I hope the Commission will have agreed on a programme to propose to us by then – and that we also hold the debate in February on the Commission's legislative programme for the year 2000. It is therefore also a sensible factual connection that advises us to hold the debate on both programmes together. That is why my group categorically rejects the Socialist Group's proposal! (Applause from the PPE-DE Group) I propose that we vote on the Socialist Group's request to put the Commission's statement on its strategic objectives back on the agenda. (Parliament rejected the request.) President. I have another request before me for Wednesday, concerning the oral question on the capital tax. The PPE-DE Group requests that this item be removed from the agenda. Would anyone like to explain the motion on behalf of the group? Madam President, since I hear a bit of laughter from the Socialists, I've been told that large sections of the Socialist Group would also like to see this item removed from the agenda because the vote of the working group of the relevant colleagues from the Socialist Group was not available during the vote in the Conference of Presidents.	de
"I believe that the idea of creating an observatory for the development of this coherence between Community policies and cooperation and development policy is sufficiently wise and relevant; its scope should not be limited to Community policies, but should also cover the actions or policies of the Member States, including the actions of economic groups, which seems important to me. Each year, this observatory will have to produce a report on the development and impacts of these policies and their combination. I have left until the end a question that seems fundamental to me and which must be recorded and approved by this Parliament. This new objective of minimizing contradictions between cooperation and development policy and other policies must be a valid objective not only within the European Union, but also at global level, given the increasing globalization of the economy. If we want fair world trade, we must impose this same principle at the next round of multilateral negotiations of the World Trade Organization, because it would be contradictory for the European Union to impose on itself an iron, but fair, discipline, while the United States and other major powers then do the opposite and approve of what we are not doing. That is why it is right and fundamental that these principles be established at the next round of the World Trade Organization. Mr. President, the Director-General of the DG for Development has stated that producing a report on the coherence of EU policies with development policies, before the presentation, next spring, of the development policy document itself, is tantamount to putting the cart before the horse. It does not matter that the Commission, subject to the requirement to produce an annual report, clearly set out in the Council resolution, has produced only one ""non-document."" The real problem is that when it comes to tackling global poverty, these oxen are climbing a hill, and the wagon of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being gently pulled back. Time and again, development policy is forgotten or given an afterthought when the European Union's major policies have already been reviewed. Take the new chocolate directive, which states that EU countries spend more on chocolate each year than on development aid. This directive has not undergone any proper development assessment, and producing countries, 90% of which are our ACP partners, estimate that it could reduce cocoa farmers' incomes by at least 15%. Take the fisheries agreements, in which we acknowledge the unsustainability of current fishing practices in EU waters. At the same time, we are negotiating joint ventures that will allow greater access for European large-scale fishing vessels to the waters of developing countries at the expense of 190 million small-scale fishermen from those countries around the world. Take trade agreements. As Mr. Nielson said this morning about Lomé, preferential access only applies to essentially all products from developing countries. In other words, when EU trade interests are at stake, poverty considerations evaporate."	fr
Ladies and gentlemen, this is what we are doing and what we are committed to. I believe that we have worked well in these months, in these weeks and I believe that we will be able to work in the coming months of 2000 during the Portuguese Presidency B which is truly doing a magnificent and extraordinary job B and continue during the French Presidency which, without a doubt, will continue to work with the same promptness and ability shown on other occasions. I wanted to say that in the meantime at least four European Councils will take place, the one in Lisbon, the one in Feria and two European Councils during the French Presidency. On these four occasions, the Heads of Government are also prepared to continue to analyse these aspects, so as not to miss the train and to be able to proceed, by 2003, to the deployment of what has been agreed, should this prove necessary. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, I believe that in this regard we are working with determination, with energy and with the great support of all the governments and all the Heads of Government. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say two more things on this matter. The European Union has the obligation to carry out this operation in contact with the third countries to which I have referred, countries which, although geographically part of Europe, are not yet part of the European Union. They are countries with which we must work, which we must integrate, because in the event of a crisis B which we obviously avoid B all forces and all countries will be more than welcome. Secondly, we must be able to establish a fluid and transparent relationship with the Atlantic Alliance. The operations that we will have to carry out in the future will be of three types. The first type will be the operations that will involve European forces within the framework of the Atlantic Alliance. The second type of operations will involve European forces and will be directed by them themselves, but will use the means and infrastructure of the Atlantic Alliance. The third type of operations involves the Europeans acting alone. In the first and the second, we will need the cooperation of the Atlantic Alliance and, therefore, to establish a transparent, positive and trust-based framework of relations between us and the Atlantic Alliance, as it should be, to the mutual advantage of both the Atlantic Alliance and ourselves. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken of the capabilities that we are prepared to deploy, of the timetable that we intend to apply and of what has been done in recent months. I would also like to add that we must not forget that we will have to deal with crisis operations in the civilian sphere too. Humanitarian crises, crises involving the forces of law and order, as unfortunately are currently occurring in Kosovo, in the Balkans: we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to all of these in proportion to our capabilities. Together with the Commission, together with Commissioner Patten, we are working in this direction. On Saturday morning I will meet with all the Interior Ministers of the fifteen Member States of the European Union to try to make them see the need we all have to mobilise the police, too, because there are times when a crisis that begins with a military necessity develops in such a way that a few months later, more than the military, the police force is needed, and more than the police, in the final phase of the crisis, perhaps judges or institutions that can create the democratic institutions that the country needs are needed.	it
"Commitments that are poorly omitted internally are clearly highlighted externally. The way in which the Commission fails to address cohesion seems serious to me. It puts in second place a principle of the Treaties - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all policies and measures of the European institutions, it seems to ignore that serious delays persist in the European regions and forgets that enlargement justifies caution in regional policy. Without real convergence, the cohesion of the European Union is put at risk. Let us remember the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions of the European Union, drawn up by the Commission. In that document it is confirmed that, for an average level of development to which a grade of 100 is attributed, the ten regions defined as ""strongest"" reach an average of 158 and the ten defined as ""weakest"" stand at 50. Draw your conclusions. 50 is exactly the level of development of the region I come from, the Azores, a region defined as ultraperipheral in the Treaties. I await the report that the Council has asked the Commission to draw up by December 1999. I conclude by reaffirming my conviction that without economic and social cohesion there will be no cohesion at all, only disintegration. Madam President, Mr President, we need - or rather European public opinion needs - a strong Commission because, in the form desired by the Treaties, as desired by the will of the people, the Commission is the driving force of European construction, this sort of Sisyphean boulder that together, after each enlargement, we must begin to push towards the top again. A strong Commission, therefore, but one that relies on a Parliament, a Parliament that is therefore your ally, although a little inconvenient, whose messages we must grasp and, taking advantage of this brief intervention, I would like to launch a couple of them. First of all, Mr President, I believe that if your two predecessors were essentially dedicated to building an internal market and introducing the single currency, it is up to you to develop all the civic value at the heart of the European construction. You must not allow yourself to be absorbed by the sole problem of enlargement, regardless of its importance. We must go further, towards reconciliation between citizens and Europe and, in particular, between citizens who are victims of economic, social and, in the future, certainly also technological fractures. The market and competition will not guarantee the promotion of scientific development, of new technologies and access to them, nor the availability and social effectiveness of major collective services, such as health, education, transport, communications, water and so on. Your action programme, your objectives are reserved, if not silent, precisely on the necessary relaunch of public investment. They are also discreet, if not silent, on the consolidation and financing of major public services and services of general interest. This is an absolute priority, Mr President, if you want to reconcile Europe and its citizens and make them choose Europe instead of Jörg Haider. Madam President, the Commission has rightly made food safety one of its priorities."	it
That was the case this time too, but I think it is a little excessive to dwell so much on these 100 amendments. I would also like to point out that our coordinator in the Committee on Budgetary Control is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who comes from Spain, and who has made an important contribution to the debate on the Spanish side. Mr President, one of the most important elements mentioned is the rapporteur's proposal to set up a permanent committee to deal with the parameters applicable to public administration. This is a very important proposal. I am only surprised that the Socialist Group is attacking it by countering it with a proposal from Mrs Morgan which aims to delete it completely. I am not clear about the situation. On the one hand, there is a lot of praise for the rapporteur, on the other, Mrs Morgan, on this point as on others, is following a scorched earth strategy aimed essentially at deleting the entire content of the report. I do not know whether the intention of this strategy is to accommodate Commissioner Kinnock. However, I know Commissioner Kinnock; I know that he wants to listen to our demands and is prepared to distance himself from them if he deems it necessary. I do not think that such a scorched earth strategy is indispensable. Finally, I would like to refer to the issue of civil servants. I completely disagree with Mr Haarder. I do agree that the text on civil servants is not at all sufficient. First of all, the emphasis is placed on the importance of public service in general, and secondly, a series of proposals are listed, the question being raised as to whether they are reasonable or whether they will actually lead to improvements. For example, we have dealt with the BATs, which is important, but at the same time we want to eliminate the temporary staff of the Commission. These two proposals are contradictory and I cannot understand how they could have been tabled. Mr President, since Plato's Republic, the Western world has been systematically tempted to replace the government of the people with the government of the wise. Already on the first occasion, our Parliament asked for the assistance of the wise men to evaluate the performance of the European Commission, and they seized the opportunity to decide its fate. In this second report, the wise men go even further, criticizing the political groups in this Parliament that would have hesitated to accept the resignation of the European Commission because of the common political affiliation of some of its members and arguing that the problem can be solved by requiring the Commissioners to renounce all political affiliations. Again according to the wise men, the Parliament should renounce the prerogatives of control of the European Commission and should be replaced in this task by a committee to guarantee good morals in public life, a permanent and non-elective body, presumably made up of another group of wise men. In their second report, the wise men teach us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund, that two-thirds of the Structural Funds are allocated to the ERDF and the Social Fund, that in the Structural Funds the principle of additionality and the principle of complementarity are equivalent, that the agricultural lobby imposes the financing of rural development through the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF and that the partnership principle applies only to the Commission and the Member States.	it
I would like to point out that the first, URBAN, aims to improve the quality of life of citizens living in different European cities, while the second, INTERREG, aims to promote cohesion and recognise the diversity and potential of the European Union's regions, at a time when the outermost regions are about to be included in Chapters B and C. Like the rapporteur, we regret the exclusion of Chapter IIIA. With regard to INTERREG, we consider the reference to the creation of a European observatory for the effects of cooperation very appropriate. We thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Decourrière, for their sensitivity to regional policy and for taking our amendments into account. I hope that the Commissioner will accept our proposal. Mr President, in the context of the various initiatives we are debating this afternoon, I would like to restrict myself strictly to a discussion of one programme, URBAN. One thing is certain: it is only because the European Parliament stubbornly insisted on continuing this initiative that we are debating this program today. The Commission's intention was to phase out this and other initiatives. But thanks to Parliament's proposal and the Commission's timely insight, URBAN is being continued. I think we can congratulate ourselves on this. But what arguments did the Commission, in this specific case Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and the Director-General, Mr. Eneko Landaburu, put forward for phasing out URBAN? They had a convincing argument. Urban issues are too important to be limited to a program with very little funding. Today we have the program, I think we have achieved something important: URBAN has become a symbol of identity in the European Union. But addressing Commissioner Barnier, I would like to say that I share the arguments put forward by the Commissioner and the Director-General, because they were right, very right. The urban dimension must be given much greater consideration in all structural funds. Given the budgetary resources our cities require—80% of Europe's population lives there, and that's where the good and bad examples of what Europe has to offer can be found—I believe that this European dimension must be taken into account, and that this URBAN program cannot be used as an excuse for not analyzing the problems comprehensively, not setting priorities, and thus not allocating disproportionately higher budgets to urban-related programs within all European funds. Therefore, I believe it is unnecessary to examine the multitude of factors that justify this investment in urban areas. The factors are known, and I would like to tell the Commissioner that we count on his understanding in this regard. The cross-sectoral approach enshrined in the new EQUAL initiative is to be welcomed. At the same time, however, it is crucial that the programme addresses the blatant discrimination that particularly affects disabled people: physical barriers in the workplace faced by people with reduced mobility, visual information systems that cannot be used by blind workers, and working methods that do not allow people with learning disabilities or mental illnesses to participate.	de
The implementation of this component is the responsibility of the Member States and national authorities; and component C, which organizes interregional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries by networking experiences concerning components A and B as well as cooperation in the field of research and technological development, a subject to be defined with the European Commission, which is responsible for its implementation. The new Interreg program, as it was sent to us, takes into account the needs generated by the enlargement to the CEECs and to the island and outermost regions. The Commission proposes that we distribute the Interreg allocation as follows: from 50 to 80% for component A, 6% for component C, the difference for component B, that is to say from 14 to 44% maximum. The European Commission draws up the list of regions eligible for components A and B. It relied essentially on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period. The outermost regions may receive support under strand B. The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which are not exhaustive for strand A, but exhaustive for strand B. It reserves the right to subsequently propose themes which it considers important for the exchange of experience and enhanced cooperation between regions, for strand C. The procedure for adopting the programmes is laid down in the general regulation on the structural funds. The proposals are drawn up by the Member States and submitted for approval to the European Commission, which checks their compliance with the general guidelines adopted. These proposals must include a number of elements: an overview of cross-border or transnational strategies and priorities, a description of the measures necessary for their implementation and an indicative financing plan. I am one of the large majority of parliamentarians who voted to maintain the Interreg Community initiative programme. I regret that Parliament was not informed of the evaluation of the previous programme - which would have allowed for optimal effectiveness of the new measures implemented, but I know how difficult this operation is - I also regret an extremely short work schedule, since the text was examined in parliamentary committee on 24 November and 26 January, and I also regret that neither the regions nor the representative regional organisations were involved in the preparation of the programme. By promoting cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation, this cross-cutting instrument is the very embodiment of a regional policy with a European dimension that promotes harmonious and balanced development of the Community territory. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, the Conference on Rural Development, held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996, defined rural development as one of the priorities of the European Union, since it is essential for agriculture, to support its existence and continued development, to provide farmers with an environment equipped with the necessary infrastructure and services, essential also for greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life, and finally essential for diversification and the creation of jobs.	fr
"That said, one can positively assess the different organization of the guidelines which, leaving aside geographical objectives, are intended for sectoral policies. If, in theory, this can satisfy the requirements of concentration and therefore effectiveness of interventions, a question arises of itself, the question of whether the current situation of the Objective 1 regions in practice allows for a policy of integrated interventions, which requires an operational instrument for coordinating the amounts allocated. We could then, in principle, even respond positively to the Commission's request to create a management centre for structural promotion in the Member States, responsible for coordinating the application and management of structural interventions on the spot, provided that this centre does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level and ensures that effective attention is paid to those regions which - I repeat once again - due to a whole series of converging negative factors, have not yet reached the correct levels in terms of the use of structural funds, so that replacing the geographical objective with sectoral policies could lead to a negative intervention in fact. The guidelines, as approved by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of fulfilling the objective of indicating orientations, they provide a catalogue of possible provisions, a catalogue which, in the absence of a progressive definition of priorities, could actually put the Member States on the wrong track by directing them towards a range of proposals contrary to the desired concentration. It could be said that, as things stand, the opportunity to effectively strengthen sustainable urban development by containing the growing phenomenon of urbanization and the associated degradation of the landscape has been missed. The importance of the global grant instrument has not been properly assessed, as it could prove very useful in rebalancing urban and rural areas, while also conferring the necessary dignity on local bodies which, through their autonomy, could define conditions for territorial development including shorter timescales, thus contributing to the efforts to reform the structural funds and the objectives of efficiency, concentration and administrative flexibility. Rural areas must truly be considered as a resource in which increasing investment is required, encouraging young people to remain in rural areas to avoid their economic and social destruction. It is now clear that to achieve this goal, jobs in rural areas will have to be created not in agriculture as traditionally understood - which is nevertheless an essential instrument for safeguarding the environment and biodiversity - but in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, the environment, small and medium-sized enterprises and services. There is a real gap in the guidelines due to the lack of concrete guidelines for ensuring coordination between the ESF and employment strategies, a coordination which, since it is being applied for the first time for the 2000-2006 programming period, presupposes that the Member States need ""guidelines""."	fr
I therefore plead in favour of maintaining the plan: debate on Friday, vote later. Madam President, I do indeed owe Mr Wurtz an explanation, and I will provide it to the whole of Parliament. We reached this agreement in principle at the Conference of Presidents. At that time, I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein would be raising the issue next week at his hearing before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. Furthermore, we have debated the issue within my group, and we believe, given the current situation in the entire process of market integration and deregulation on such a sensitive subject, that it is appropriate that Parliament, whatever it does in the future, first pronounce itself so that Commissioner Bolkestein can take due note and guide the debate next week. Madam President, I would simply like to invite my colleague, Mr Wurtz, to reread and check what it is about. This is not a substantive discussion, but simply the following question: when will the Commission finally be able to present the directive, given that it has already had a year and a half to do so? With this resolution, we simply want to ensure that the deadlines agreed to by the Commission are finally met. It is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible. That is why I would like to support the Social Democrats' proposal to hold the vote this Friday. (Parliament agrees) Madam President, since the Cederschiöld report is no longer on the agenda for Thursday's sitting, we should have a little more time on that day. Given the number of issues that will have to be debated in an hour and a half, the urgent business session is likely to be very tight. Could the plenary proceedings department therefore check whether it is possible to grant us an extra half hour for the urgent business session, so that we have sufficient speaking time? Last week, the organization of the session seems to me to have been very chaotic. We had a very tight schedule in terms of speaking time, then suddenly, last Thursday, we found ourselves with a gap on the agenda for an hour, or even an hour and a half. We had to wait until the vote. This Friday, only one item is on the agenda. This is completely absurd. I would urge us to examine the organization of the session. This is something that is entirely possible: let us see if we can extend the urgent business session by half an hour, taking into account the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschiöld's report. That is what this is about and that alone. Madam President, I wanted to speak about Wednesday's agenda, which you did not announce.	fr
This is the correct procedure. Mr President, I request that the matter be referred back to committee pursuant to Rule 69(2). The reason for this is that this concerns the approximation of a legal provision proposed by the Commission. We have accepted this, but have proposed further approximation of the legal provisions relating to this directive, in particular the adoption of a text – which has been approved in its entirety by the Commission – on the use and labelling of genetically modified organisms. We believe that this belongs in this approximation at this stage, but the Commission is not accepting it. I think that, pursuant to Rule 69(2), we must try to enter into dialogue with the Commission, and I therefore ask my colleagues to agree to the referral back. (Parliament adopted the request for referral back to committee.) Report (A5-0034/2000) by Mrs Stenzel, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Member States laying down guidelines for Community initiative programmes (CIPs) for which Member States may submit proposals for support under the EQUAL initiative (COM(1999) 476 - C5-0260/1999 - 1999/2186/COS)) Before the vote: Mr President, let me say publicly to Mrs Stenzel, as a member of the ÖVP executive committee, that many Members are appalled that you have entered into a coalition with Haider, and that we wish to condemn this here! (Applause from the left, heckling from the right) Mr Cohn-Bendit, Members of the House, I do not think that the European Parliament is the place to intervene in a country's internal politics on such a massive scale as you are doing. I can speak for my party, which was a pioneer in Austria's accession to the European Union and has since joined. As a political force, we are the guarantee that Austria will remain committed to European values. I refuse to allow myself to be pigeonholed into a right-wing corner for domestic and party-political reasons! This does not reflect the facts; it is pure polemic! I categorically reject this! (Lively, prolonged applause from the center and the right, protest from the left) Welcome I would like to take this opportunity to welcome to the distinguished visitors' gallery a delegation of four members of the Moroccan Parliament, led by Mr. Brahim Rachidi, Vice-President of the House of Representatives. We are delighted at the visit of this delegation so shortly before the entry into force of the Association Agreement between Morocco and the European Union on 1 March 2000. On the occasion of this historic step, we welcome the developments in our relations and the prospect of intensified contacts between our two parliaments. To this end, a delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries and the Arab Maghreb Union will travel to Morocco from 20 to 22 March. I wish the delegation a successful stay in Strasbourg. (Loud applause) Mr President, since you are welcoming a delegation, I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that we also have the pleasure of welcoming to our House today the principal officers of the Austrian anti-racism associations, who do Parliament the honor of their visit.	de
In the new programme presented for the period 2000-2006, financed by the European Social Fund, the resources used and the policies implemented must be aimed, with the support of the Commission, at achieving the objectives I have mentioned. The Commission will monitor the work of the Greek Government closely in order to honour the commitments it has made. I thank the Commissioner for his reply. However, Mrs Diamantopoulou, the situation we find ourselves in is the following. We have the second highest unemployment rate in Europe, namely 11.3% - in the past it was not that high -, we have the highest rate of increase in the number of unemployed, we are the country that spends the least on the unemployed, namely less than 1% of GDP while the other countries spend between 3 and 4% (such as France, Belgium and Germany), and it is not at all clear how the Social Fund appropriations, which were allocated, among other things, to the fight against unemployment, have been used. You tell me that the Commission has made certain recommendations. I take note of this and I am pleased: let's hope that the recommendations will be respected! However, I have been asking myself for some time: what about the policies adopted previously? Have some people found work? And if so, how many? At least last year and two years ago, if you cannot provide us with the figures for this year. And what about training? Do the famous training centres serve to provide work for trainers or for trainees? Do we have figures available? In short, do we have the possibility of monitoring at least in part the progress of this policy of the Greek Government? Mr Papayannakis, I can tell you that the Greek Government will really have to step up its efforts at this point in the computerised management of statistical data and in the creation of structures that allow the programmes implemented to translate into quantitative results, as you say, and that allow for real monitoring on the basis of which policies can then be oriented. Greece has seen an increase in the unemployment rate and, from what I see from these figures, an increase in productivity. What the Commission can do concerns the guidelines in question. As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is judged, and they concern, among other things, access to training, its numerical distribution between men and women, and specific measures for the long-term unemployed. The Commission will endeavour to quantify the data and to have precise figures for all these guidelines, and this will depend on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000-2006. Question No 36 by the Honourable Member (H-0782/99): Subject: The Danish early retirement programme Can the Commission say whether the Danish early retirement programme has been fully approved or whether there are still differences between Denmark and the Commission in relation to other social sectors? The Danish pension system, Efterløn, only allows the retirement of those who are resident in Denmark and have completed the required periods of work in this country. Some workers have lodged a complaint with the European Commission, alleging that their pension rights are being denied.	it
In the Swedish case, excise duties are indeed used to reduce alcohol consumption. Although this leads to a disparity in excise duties between Sweden and other EU Member States—and as such increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products—it is a legitimate instrument to reduce alcohol consumption. Of course, there is the elasticity of demand; in this case, the price elasticity of demand. I am not entirely sure of its value, but it is not zero, and therefore it must have an effect. My question would have been almost identical to the one raised by Mr. Purvis, but I would like to take the argument further. Even if you accept, as you have said, that excise duties are a prerogative of the Member States, the fact remains that the use of that prerogative in a way that discriminates and is unfair to producers in one part of the Community as against other producers may conflict with the principle of the single market. For example, if we look at what Mr Purvis and I are thinking of - the whisky-producing Highland regions, which are particularly peripheral parts of Europe, under great pressure, where farming and distilling communities are entirely dependent on that production - the general practice of taxing the alcohol in Scotch whisky, Dutch genever or Danish aquavit more heavily than the alcohol in beer or wine seems to me to be discriminatory and to be a discriminatory use of a practice that is commonly recognised as being within the prerogative of the Member States. Let me confirm to Mr MacCormick and other Members of this Parliament that the current situation, in which excise duties differ between Member States, is indeed not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market. We must not limit ourselves to alcoholic products. If we look at petrol, for example, we see that excise duties levied in Germany are different from those levied in the Netherlands: the result is that Dutch drivers cross the border and fill up in Germany. This is indeed a distortion of the internal market. If it were up to me, I would use a magic wand to harmonize excise duties across Europe. This would put an end to all smuggling, unless products are inherently more expensive in certain Member States. But I do not have a magic wand and it is not up to me alone. This is an area that requires unanimity, as Mr MacCormick knows, and unless all Member States agree on the harmonization of excise duties, it will not take place. Once again, the Commission will submit a report towards the end of the year on the state of play regarding excise duties, and I am naturally open to any discussion with Parliament on that report. Thank you very much, Commissioner. Today we will deal with you and offer you a glass—or two, perhaps—of Alsace wine, the taxation of which we do not know, although I assume that it will also be heavily taxed. As the time for Question Time has expired, Questions 55 to 114 will receive written answers.	fr
A third-country national who has legal status in one Member State must also be admitted to other Member States. This does not prevent those States from taking public policy measures within the framework of the proposed prior notification obligation. The Commission also finds unacceptable the proposal to maintain legal status in force for three months after the expiry of the card. It is unacceptable that the national concerned can remain in the host country after the end of their provision of services. This is why the Commission supports, in both respects, Amendment 22 by Mrs Palacio. As regards the second proposal, the Commission understands the desire for a clear definition of the concept of self-employed and therefore intends to address this in its amended proposal. These are some preliminary remarks on the most important amendments. I hope you will give me another opportunity, at the end of the debate and after all speakers have spoken, to expand on the individual amendments. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in tomorrow's vote, the EPP Group will support the Legal Affairs Committee's proposed amendments and the editorial changes by a large majority. I will limit my intervention to two areas. The first area is the question of what this directive should have the effect of – in the literal sense of the word. On the one hand, there are the interests of the economy and the individual. Let me say straight away that my explanations are based on the assumption that this is an honest individual and a conscientious worker. On the other hand, there are the interests of the Member States, which should perhaps assume the worst for the individuals concerned. If we consider one of the extremes, the interests of the Member States, there are certainly good reasons for providing fairly high hurdles for issuing this card. Then there are good reasons to justify the rapid introduction, despite this card, of notification obligations. If I consider the other extreme, namely the fewest possible obstacles, I run the risk that this procedure will deprive me of any legislation because the Member States will not approve the directive. In the end, either I will have a directive on the service card that no one will actually have because the obstacles placed on the economic sector will be too great, or I will not even have a directive. Neither outcome can satisfy us. Perhaps this is also why we are told that negotiations are also stalled on this subject in the Council. We have tried to find a balance, as light a solution as possible, between the interest of public policy and the other interest. We want to have a solution that dismantles certain obstacles placed on the economic sector but which allows, once these obstacles have been overcome, to achieve as light an application as possible. This is why we want a service card to be requested for one or more Member States. If a French company declares that one of its employees must work permanently in Denmark and only in Denmark, the service provision card should be able to be requested for that country only.	fr
This observatory will have to produce an annual report on the evolution and impact of these policies and their coordination. I have left for last a question that I think is fundamental and that I think should be put on record and approved by the Assembly. Our objective of reducing to a minimum the contradictions between cooperation and development policy and other policies must be valid not only within the European Union, but also at global level, given the increasing globalisation of the economy. If we want fair world trade, we must affirm this principle in the next round of multilateral negotiations within the World Trade Organisation, because it would be contradictory for the European Union to impose on itself an iron discipline, albeit fair, and to let the United States and the other major powers do the opposite, taking advantage of our reserve. It is therefore right and essential that these principles be enshrined in the next round of negotiations at the World Trade Organisation. Mr President, the Director-General of DG Development has said that producing a report on the coherence of EU policies with development policy, before the paper on development policy itself due in the spring, is like putting the cart before the horse. Leaving aside the fact that the request for an annual report, clearly addressed to the Commission in the Council resolution, has produced only a 'non-document', the real problem is that when it comes to alleviating world poverty those horses are going uphill and the cart of other EU policies is so heavy that it is slowly dragging development policy backwards. When you look at the main policies of the European Union, development policy is often forgotten or is simply an afterthought. Take the new chocolate directive, which shows that EU countries spend more on chocolate each year than on development aid. No accurate assessment has been made of the development impact of this directive which, according to producing countries, 90 percent of which are our ACP partners, could reduce cocoa farmers' incomes by at least 15 percent. Take the fisheries agreement, where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing methods in EU waters. At the same time, we are concluding joint venture agreements to give large European fishing vessels greater access to developing country waters, to the detriment of 190 million small-scale fishermen in those countries. Take trade agreements. As Commissioner Nielson said this morning in relation to Lomé, preferential access is granted for essentially all products from the least developed countries. In other words, when the EU's trade interests are at stake, considerations of poverty go out the window. Given our position in Seattle, why this silence on the EU's failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed under GATT, including those for the crucial textile industry? As regards the common agricultural policy, which bears the greatest blame, no assessment has been made of the development impact of the CAP reforms envisaged by Agenda 2000. Everyone is now aware of the scandal of the export refund scheme, which dumped a surplus of 54 000 tonnes of subsidised beef on the markets of West Africa, reducing by half the prices paid to local farmers.	it
"We ask the Commission to reconsider these proposals. Finally, we would urge Members, in particular, to vote against Amendment 41 on capital requirements, as we believe it would be very bad for the industry. I would also like to point out that I am the first Member to stay within my time limit. Mr President, pecunia non olet, as the Latins used to say. What matters is that money multiplies. This is the only point at which we reconcile the interests of economists with the interests of all those who want to earn money and who only have dollars on their minds, like Scrooge McDuck, who is portrayed with a dollar sign for eyes, only in this case it is the euro sign. Here we reconcile the interests of these citizens and the interests of pensioners who want to live a carefree life. For example, my brother-in-law, who lives in Rome, retired a year ago, and since then, every day from 7:00 a.m. when he gets up until midnight, he has been watching on television the performance of the pension funds and securities in which he has invested. Pensioners will in the future—as they do now—have enormous sums of money at their disposal. While the young are poor, the elderly have accumulated money, and because they want to increase it, they have a great interest in this directive. If national governments—as the European Union does with this directive—were concerned about increasing the amount of money earned over the course of a working life, the burning problem of the pension explosion would already be solved. You, Commissioner Bolkestein, by virtue of your office also bear a very great responsibility for the future of older people and pensioners, a future that I hope will be better once we have adopted this directive as soon as possible, in accordance with the proposal by Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi. Mr President, first of all, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which is responsible for the report. I would also like to thank Mr Brian Crowley, draftsman, and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for their commendable and intensive efforts in developing and expanding the proposals. Since the adoption of Directive 85/611, the capital and securities markets have evolved continuously, so the current provisions now need to be adapted accordingly. The new proposals aim to maintain a uniform minimum level of investor protection, which, following the introduction of the euro, is an essential prerequisite for market integration. Since the average European family invests its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions for prudent management—I would like to emphasize this very much—for prudent management in terms of investment policy and risk diversification. The two proposals form a coherent whole. The first proposal expands the instruments in which an ""undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities"" (UCITS) can invest. UCITS, as has already been stated in this Chamber, are among the most important players in modern financial markets."	de
This is why we must focus our attention on policies - Mr. Karas also mentioned this - that lead to the overvaluation of a particular currency in relation to its actual potential. However, this would require control measures for the import and export of capital, otherwise we cannot focus on these policies. The Tobin tax therefore seems like a sensible idea, but it is not without problems, even if we could manage to implement it, which, I repeat, I doubt. We must remember that as things stand, money is above all information, and that in the future the global economy will increasingly revolve around the power of knowledge and intellectual capital. This is why the uninterrupted flow of colossal masses of fortune between the world's financial centers is not purely a speculative activity entirely disconnected from the real economy. If this feedback mechanism, which therefore gives users the opportunity to make choices, is hampered by measures such as the Tobin tax, this may result in erroneous choices whose economic cost will be far greater than the tax would ever generate. This is why, as Mr Kalas has already explained so well, our group is absolutely opposed to the adoption of the Tobin tax. Madam President, I am speaking in favour of taxing capital movements for speculative purposes across monetary boundaries. It seems to me absolutely clear that action is necessary. Over the past 30 years, the volume of monetary transactions has increased 83-fold, with the following results: firstly, the total of central bank reserves worldwide is barely equal to the daily volume of transactions on the foreign exchange markets; Second, the annual volume of real world trade in goods and services is equivalent to exactly three and a half days out of 350 of speculation in the foreign exchange markets, which means that trade in goods and services accounts for 1 percent of capital movements, compared to 99 percent for speculation. The size, unpredictability, and irrationality of global foreign exchange markets make it increasingly difficult to manage national and regional economies. Computer trading programs have transformed a marginal phenomenon into a tidal wave, sweeping away jobs, lives, and industries all over the planet. The only argument against taxing speculative capital movements is that it would undermine the efficiency of foreign exchange markets: a rather bizarre argument considering the frenzy that has gripped the markets, destroying jobs all over the world, from East Asia to Europe and Latin America. Mr. Chirac has called those participating in this frenzy the AIDS virus of the global economy. What is needed is to put a spanner in the works of currency speculators, stockbrokers, and options sellers. This is, of course, not feasible on a national scale, or even on a eurozone scale, but it could be done on a global level, with good international cooperation. Europe, Japan, and the United States, the euro, the yen, and the dollar, would, in my opinion, constitute a sufficient bloc. The EPP Group disappoints me.	fr
During the negotiations, the Commission must make every effort to admit every candidate country into the Union as quickly as possible. At the same time, care must be taken to ensure that the successes achieved in integration to date and the objectives set for it are not diluted. To prevent this, the Liberal Group has expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will discuss models for differentiated integration and create a concentric Union with a federal state at the core, around which a less integrated outer circle is grouped. It is foreseeable that the Union's internal differentiation will be addressed at the Intergovernmental Conference. This issue must be addressed impartially. A technical improvement of the flexibility system is not enough; rather, the development of separate institutions for the vanguard countries must be sought, as Jacques Delors already proposed. This would create a decision-making system with greater efficiency, clarity, transparency, and democracy. I hope that the Commission will put forward its own proposal on how the institutional and other differentiation of the enlarging Union should be implemented. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I was seduced by your inspiring speech, Mr Prodi. It raises expectations, but it can also disappoint. This is due to the discrepancy between words and deeds, to which Mr van Velzen just pointed out. The enlargement of the Union is driven by our desire for peace, security, and stability. You want to reassure the candidate countries and the European public. However, we can see with our own eyes how the exact opposite is happening today. Fear and unrest are spreading even in regions that are prosperous and virtually free of unemployment. As Mr Swoboda says, and I agree with him in this respect, we must make our citizens feel at home. Here we are united by the same values, and everyone knows their roles and responsibilities. This is probably due to the standards mentioned by Mr van Dam. That is subsidiarity: clearly defined powers at all decision-making levels, partnership instead of competition in politics. Exercising power as closely as possible to the citizen, where transparency is maintained and the citizens themselves have the opportunity to exercise control. This requires a new political culture, not only in theory but also in practice, one that is geared to the reality in the Member States and regions. Regions which, due to their cultural and economic importance, are sometimes quite equal to some Member States. The new Europe must not only develop in breadth; its progress must also go deeper, with us truly living our values and driving forward the democratic construction of a genuine community. The Commission will have to be judged by this. Madam President, the Commission is presenting its strategic objectives for the years 2000-2005 today in an extremely general document in which all sticking points are glossed over so as not to scare off either side too much. Thus, in the first section on the new European decision-making structures, one will naturally not find the words federalism or superstate anywhere. But these concepts inevitably emerge when we talk of strong European institutions which only decentralise their day-to-day executive activities and which develop their collective vision in a confused structure in which governments and national parliaments are mixed with regional and even local authorities and civil society, all of which are described, without any hierarchy, as - and I quote - 'an integral part of European decision-making structures'.	de
"Therefore, the European Union must take a clear position on the current situation in Austria. (SV) We voted for the joint resolution to express our solidarity with all those exposed to xenophobia and racism, and also in protest against the despicable policies represented by Jörg Haider. However, we reject the methods used by the 14 Member States on this issue. The resolution lacks a clear reference to respect for national identity and legal traditions, as required by Article 6 of the Treaty. We also miss a point on the EU's shared responsibility for social and political development in Europe and Austria, which was one of the prerequisites for Haider's electoral success. Right-wing extremism is—today, as in Europe's earlier history—the result of precarious social and economic living conditions. The austerity policies implemented in the course of EMU adjustment have fostered the successes of right-wing extremism. A radical policy of security and justice in every country is the best guarantee for democratic development in Europe. I make this statement on behalf of the CSU group. It is intolerable that the EU should interfere in the formation of a member state's government. This is not the EU's right. Instead of prejudging the FPÖ and the Austrian government currently being formed, we must first critically examine and evaluate the government declaration, the party program, and the coalition's policies. Only after such a critical examination of the future policies of the parties in coalition talks can we decide whether this government contradicts the democratic spirit of Europe. This does not mean that we sympathize with Haider. The CSU MEPs have no sympathy whatsoever for FPÖ leader Haider. As politicians, we must rather ask ourselves why 27% of the Austrian population voted for a party like the FPÖ in the October 1999 elections. We must examine the reasons for this and try to eliminate the factors that lead to such results. Only an examination of the FPÖ's arguments and policies can prevent a radicalization of politics in Austria. The European Parliament's resolution, however, does not question the reasons for the Austrian election result and does not suggest a possible solution. For these reasons, the CSU European Parliamentary Group opposes this resolution. ""For he knew what was unknown to this cheerful crowd and what can be read in books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears, but can slumber for decades in furniture and linen, that it waits patiently in rooms, cellars, suitcases, handkerchiefs, and old papers, and that perhaps the day will come when, to the misfortune and instruction of humanity, the plague will awaken its rats and send them out again to die in a happy city."" With these words, shortly after the Second World War, at the end of a long allegorical narrative about the difficult struggle of the inhabitants of Oran against the plague, Albert Camus reminds us that there is no final victory in the fight against Nazism, the ""brown plague""—as it was called at the time. That racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear of the Other and rejection of the Other, which have their roots in the lowest traits of human nature, can resurface at any time in any group of people and gain dominance."	de
This means that all the political groups, except the non-attached groups - which do not constitute a political group - were in agreement and that only one group was of the opinion that we should proceed as my colleague proposed here. All the others were of a different opinion and so it was decided. I would now like to go into the substance of the matter briefly. We have confidence in the Commission, in Romano Prodi and the large majority of our political group, as everyone knows, voted confidence in Romano Prodi and the Commission after a difficult process. However, we are also of the opinion that the Commission's strategy should be discussed in the course of a regular procedure, not only on the basis of an oral statement in this Parliament but also on the basis of a document adopted by the Commission setting out this programme for the next five years. But such a document does not yet exist! The Commission will present the programme for 2000 in February. We have agreed: if the Commission does not want to discuss the 2000 programme in January, we will do so in February. We certainly do not want to enter into conflict with the Commission. On the contrary, we believe that the Commission and Parliament should go down the same road as far as possible. However, Parliament also has a supervisory role over the Commission and not everything that the Commission proposes necessarily has to be agreed with us. I would like us in the political groups to be able to prepare ourselves adequately for the debate on the five-year programme. This cannot be done by listening to a statement whose content we do not know exactly. We therefore recommend - and I have the impression that the Commission is also prepared to accept this idea - that in February we discuss the Commission's long-term programme up to 2005 - in the hope that by then the Commission will have agreed on a programme which it will submit to us - and, again in February, the Commission's legislative programme for the year 2000. It is therefore on the basis of an objective link that we propose to discuss the two programmes at the same time and for this reason my political group emphatically rejects the Socialist Group's proposal! (Applause from the PPE-DE Group benches) Madam President, I would like to state clearly that, first of all, the Commission has the utmost respect for Parliament's decisions, including that of drawing up its own agenda. We therefore respect any decisions Parliament may make on this matter. But I would also like to say clearly that President Prodi has committed himself to Parliament to include a new debate, as Mr Barón has said, in addition to the annual debate on the Commission's legislative programme, on the broad lines of action for the next five years, that is to say, for the present parliamentary term. I would like to stress, Madam President, that, according to the agreement reached last September, this debate was separate from the presentation of the Commission's legislative programme. And I would like to make it known that, as far as the Commission is concerned, we are ready and willing to hold this debate whenever it is deemed appropriate; we were already ready to do so this week, in accordance with the initial agreement, on the basis of the understanding that the speech would be presented to the parliamentary groups the day before.	it
In my opinion, it is regrettable that the Commission has not given the same assessment of Leader II, assessing the quality of the projects, the number of loans used, and, above all, the demobilization of some local stakeholders in the face of the administrative and financial obstacles encountered. However, I welcome the fact that, within the framework of Leader+, new resources have been committed to helping rural areas develop their potential and implement the objectives of local and sustainable development. I believe it is important to place particular emphasis on experimenting with new ways of enhancing natural and cultural heritage, as well as strengthening economic environments to foster employment. I believe it is appropriate to consider that the sharing of these positive development experiences can also be part of the framework of transnational cooperation. It is worth emphasizing that all rural areas will be eligible for Leader II. However, although Member States are still able to define zones within this initiative, the Commission must ensure a certain concentration of resources and the prioritization of projects in less prosperous areas. Of course, transparency prevails over the selection criteria for projects and local action groups. Likewise, I believe that we must ensure above all that the financial mechanisms of states or local authorities do not again generate payment delays, which have been able to lead some local action groups to financial bankruptcy within the framework of Leader II. Mr. President, as a Member from an outermost region, I must point out that this is a very special afternoon in terms of regional policy, and I say this because of the debate on two Community initiatives: URBAN and INTERREG. I would like to point out that these initiatives are aimed, the first, URBAN, at improving the quality of life of citizens living in the neighborhoods of the various European cities, and INTERREG at facilitating cohesion and recognizing the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union, particularly when it comes to including the outermost regions in Chapters B and C. We deplore, as does the rapporteur, its exclusion from Chapter IIIA. We believe that the reference to the creation of a European observatory for cooperation in INTERREG is very appropriate. I thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr. Decourrière, for their regional sensitivity and for accepting our amendments. I hope that the Commissioner will accept our proposal. Mr. President, with regard to the various initiatives we are analyzing this afternoon, I would like to focus strictly on a reflection on one of them, specifically the URBAN program. It is true that we are debating this program today because the European Parliament was adamant that this initiative should be maintained. The Commission's proposal was to eliminate it, along with other initiatives, but Parliament's proposal and the Commission's own sensitivity at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained.	es
Thank you very much, Mr Barnier. You have answered the questions specifically and opened the dialogue on Europe that you initiated. You have set a very good example today of respecting speaking time. The debate is closed. Question Time (Commission) The next item is Question Time (B5-0009/2000). We will be dealing with questions to the Commission. Part I Question No 36 by (H-0025/00): Subject: Infant mortality in Kosovo According to the most recent figures sent to the United Nations by the World Health Organization, Kosovo has the highest infant mortality rate in Europe; almost 50% of premature babies die, while the war has led to a sharp rise in miscarriages, and those babies who are carried to term are not as well developed physically. In light of the European Union's humanitarian aid and the efforts of Special Representative Bernard Kouchner, can the Commission indicate what measures have been taken in Kosovo to protect women's right to maternity, as well as the health of pregnant women, new mothers, and infants? Mr President, the Commission is fully aware of the very difficult situation regarding health and medical facilities in Kosovo, not only for pregnant women but more generally. This situation is the result both of the recent conflict and the years of neglect that preceded it. The figures mentioned regarding infant mortality are eloquent and unacceptable. But the situation is hardly better for other sections of the population. The Commission has taken the following measures: First, the health sector is receiving extensive support from ECHO. The focus is on the provision of medical supplies and emergency medical assistance, support for health facilities, and vaccination. However, we are increasingly focusing on the creation of a self-sustaining health care system in the province. This process is being significantly supported by UNMIK. Secondly, the reconstruction programme has begun to carry out urgent initial measures at Mitrovica Hospital, using EUR 1 million from the rehabilitation programme. Due to the strained relations between the ethnic groups in this divided city, work is progressing slowly. However, thanks to the support of UNMIK, the Commission can continue its assistance through this project. We hope that this project will one day become a symbol of ethnic reconciliation. Based on the Community's assessment of the damage, the cost of rebuilding health facilities and equipping pharmacies and clinics is estimated at EUR 4 million. The Commission is now turning to programming the funds for the year 2000. We expect that a substantial amount will be allocated, among other things, for the reconstruction of the health sector. The focus will be on long-term reforms addressing health care financing, training, and procurement. The extent to which the Commission can participate in these measures is currently being examined with UNMIK. Commissioner, This morning, Commission President Prodi emphasized, among other things, that our ability to act effectively is being put to the test in the Balkans, that the very credibility of the European Union is at stake, and that the gap between words and deeds must finally be bridged. Do you not think, Commissioner, that the available data on the high infant and child mortality rate in Kosovo—the highest in all of Europe—and the general picture of human misery and destruction in Kosovo, are already seriously undermining our credibility and calling into question our ability to turn promises into action?	de
"After the failed talks between the SPÖ and the ÖVP, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government, asking the FPÖ to support them. We were offered three ministerial posts – you only have to read the newspapers to know this – posts offered to the very party that is accused of being fascist here! After we suddenly refused such an offer, a frenzied campaign of incitement and propaganda began that we still cannot understand. The FPÖ is a party that has a well-established position in the political landscape of Austria: one of its members is the Prime Minister of one of the nine states of the Republic of Austria, while the party participates in the governments of all the others. Therefore, many Austrians today are wondering why their democratic choice is suddenly interpreted as an expression of a fascist mentality and why the incitement campaign began only after the FPÖ withdrew its support for a minority government. A climate of prejudice is spreading which, without looking at our program, reduces the cruelest period in European history to a political spectacle. It truly disgusts me that some of our opponents exploit, for low-grade propaganda purposes, the millions of people who died in the gas chambers of concentration camps. This was done, for example, by the Honourable Bertinotti, who yesterday, on Italian television, accused Haider of denying the Holocaust. Shame on you, colleague! Even if you have exhausted all political arguments, you still have no right to exploit the memory of those killed for your petty propaganda. You will not gain a reputation as an anti-fascist by denouncing a democratically elected colleague as a Nazi! On the contrary, you do nothing but mock the real victims of National Socialism and minimize fascist dictatorships. You act on the basis of your prejudices, renouncing any political debate. In doing so, you behave precisely in the style you claim to want to fight. The attacks on the new Austrian Government, the attempt to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people. We are therefore particularly grateful to the Commission for the position it has taken. In future negotiations within the coalition, we will discuss democratic reform, the rights of the opposition, the commitment to compensate forced labourers... (The President interrupted the speaker) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my speech by making it very clear that there is no danger of a resurgence in Austria of either a one-party political system or a right-wing totalitarian system. Austria is a stable democracy, in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and protected by an independent judiciary. Austria is an open country, in which there is no room for xenophobia and discrimination. What is happening in Austria is nothing more than a normal process of transfer of power following democratic elections in which a ""no"" was said to the old system and a stable parliamentary majority was sought and found that could implement the necessary economic and social reforms."	it
"Now, Intergovernmental Conferences are like an event and can also be like a Christmas tree. Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that these issues, which are recurrent and have been passed down from one conference to another, may be raised. The problem that arises is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union to include this issue, bearing in mind in particular that, if an issue of this kind is included, other similar issues will likely be added to the Conference's agenda. Mr. Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a point of order. I would ask you to be brief. Mr. President, I understand that I have to do it very quickly. I very much liked what Mr. Seixas da Costa said about Santa Claus. In Spain, they say ""Letter to the Three Wise Men."" I simply want to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent the letter to the Three Wise Men with its reports. Now it is up to the Presidency, and the Council, to bring the gifts we requested in our letter to the Three Wise Men. As I suspected, it wasn't exactly a point of order, but rather a closing of the debate. We thank Mr. Seixas da Costa, but he can also write his letter to the Three Wise Men. I would just like to say that this Christmas-related issue raised by the Honorable Member is of the utmost importance. However, in this case, Santa Claus can only give gifts when authorized by others. It will not be up to the Portuguese Presidency to provide the gifts everyone wants, particularly those requested by the European Parliament. After this interesting exchange of views, and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I inform you that Questions 17 to 27 will be answered in writing. Question time to the Council is now closed. Capital tax The next item is the joint debate on: the oral question (B5-0004/2000) by Mr Désir and others to the Council, on the Council's position on the idea of a capital tax. the oral question (B5-0005/2000) by Mr Désir and others to the Commission, on the Commission's position on the idea of a capital tax. Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, everyone was able to appreciate, during the Asian crisis in 1997, as well as after the crisis that hit Mexico in 1995, or the EMS in 1993, the damage to the economies of entire countries that financial speculation, particularly speculation on currencies, can cause. Between 1,500 and 2,000 billion euros are exchanged daily on financial markets, or in four days, the equivalent of the entire global annual production, of global GDP, which is approximately 6,000 billion euros. In other words, these financial transactions are, for the most part, purely speculative, with no link to the exchange of goods or investments. But the erratic movement of such considerable amounts of capital can cause the collapse of a currency, of a country's economy, and plunge the entire population into recession within a matter of hours."	es
Isn't it time for the Turkish government to lift the economic blockade against Armenia? Mr. President, I would like to thank the representative of the Council Presidency for his response. However, I am somewhat saddened that, although this is initially viewed as a bilateral issue, it ultimately involves a major triangular relationship. We provide partnership funds and have cooperation agreements to help Armenia, and yet the aid cannot be effective because Turkey is imposing an economic blockade, preventing many things from progressing for the Armenians. Negotiations are underway with Turkey regarding possible accession, and it is in all of our interests that every state that wishes to become a member maintains friendly relations with its neighbors, including those along its border. Can't you exert greater influence on Turkey to facilitate peaceful development here, to enable the Armenians to develop in a way that is necessary for further cooperation? Madam Member, you are quite right when you say that we must use our relations with Turkey to ensure that the country in question can play a constructive role in this situation and, above all, is part of the solution and no longer part of the problem. Precisely because Turkey has embarked on a new path in its relations with the European Union, and because Turkey is now also confronted with the need to respond to the European Union's positions in the area of the common foreign and security policy, we will – there is no need to conceal this – examine Turkey's intentions with regard to the European Union's priorities in its external relations. Naturally, relations with Armenia, as evidenced by the agreement concluded last year, also fall within these external relations. We believe that if Turkey wishes to share the fundamental values of the European Union and the general framework of European Union relations – and regardless of the specific bilateral relations it may have with other countries – it should generally conduct itself in accordance with the basic standards that the European Union applies in its external relations. We also expect that this issue will be a key focus in bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future. Since they cover similar topics, Questions 5 and 6 will be answered together. Question 5 (H-0031/00): Subject: Worsening situation in Kosovo. The genocide of the Serbs and other ethnic groups in Kosovo, apart from the Albanians, continues and is becoming even more serious. Even Mr. Kouchner recently stated that the political and security situation in Kosovo is anything but good. It is also pointed out that UN Resolution 1244 is not being applied and, in particular, that its provisions, which contain guarantees for all inhabitants of Kosovo, are being violated. Instead, the extremist, separatist forces are being encouraged, culminating in the appointment of the former KLA leader, H. Thaqi, as 'provisional Prime Minister' of Kosovo and the KLA being declared 'the protection force for Kosovo'. In view of this situation, what does the Council intend to do to ensure that UN resolutions, and in particular Resolution 1244, are implemented and prevent the separation of the province of Kosovo from Serbia?	de
I myself have mentioned various possible responses to this challenge, which consists for all of us in recalling, in demonstrating again what we have been doing together since 1957: Economic Community of course, but first of all Community of Values and Charter of Fundamental Rights which will protect individual citizens more and more clearly; Article 13 of the Treaty, relating to discrimination, which we proposed, in our opinion of 26 January, even before the Austrian crisis, should be governed, after the IGC, by qualified majority and no longer by unanimity; the possible hypothesis, I repeat possible - I say this in a personal capacity - of supplementing Article 7 with a new paragraph which would provide the democratic monitoring or alert procedure with a legal basis and then, finally, public debate. The only way to push back bad ideas is to express others. So I come back to the subject of our discussion just now, I deeply believe in the value and democratic power of debate, particularly in combating demagogy. Commissioner Barnier, you strongly insisted in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe. As for the IGC, you know that under the Helsinki decisions, the Portuguese Presidency was granted the specific right to broaden the agenda of the IGC during this Conference. It is clear that Parliament will have its own representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos. However, Commissioner, would you also be able to undertake, if the agenda is broadened by the Council, to refer the matter to Parliament so that we can debate it within ourselves but also with you, in order to continue this dialogue with the citizens on which you have so insisted? Mr Beazley, my answer is clearly yes, but it is not really new. President Napolitano and many members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and even more Members here in plenary session, know that I will be available to say, on behalf of the Commission, throughout these negotiations, in a spirit of transparency and in real time, how things are going. I may say it differently from Professor Tsatsos and Elmar Brok, who are your direct representatives. It is likely, moreover, that in many circumstances, we will say it together. I believe it is very important that these negotiations not be clandestine, either with regard to the European Parliament or with regard to the national parliaments, which, I remind you, will ultimately have their opinion to give and their positions to take in the ratification process. This is why I paid tribute to Mr Napolitano's initiative for joint, regular consultation between the national parliaments of the fifteen countries and the European Parliament. That said, the duty of transparency and debate begins here, with regard to the reform of the institutions. So, I will be available whenever you wish to report to you on our positions and the progress of these negotiations throughout the coming year. Mr President, I would first like to compliment the Commission on its approach. I think it is really very good to begin dialogue with citizens as soon as possible because, frankly, this did not happen in the wake of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Treaty of Maastricht and it only led to great mistrust.	fr
"This objective of minimizing contradictions is a just and reasonable one, and one that the proposed resolution is directed toward. I believe the idea of establishing an observatory to develop this coherence between Community policies and cooperation and development policies is entirely logical and appropriate. Its scope of action must not be limited to Community policies, but must also encompass the measures or policies of the Member States, including those of economic groups, which I consider important. This observatory should produce an annual report on the development and impact of these policies and their interrelationships. I have reserved for last a question which, in my view, is of fundamental importance and which must be examined and confirmed by this Parliament. Our objective of minimizing contradictions between cooperation and development policies and other policies must be valid not only within the European Union but, given the increasing globalization of the economy, also on a global scale. If we want to achieve fair world trade, we must enforce the same principle in the next round of multilateral negotiations at the World Trade Organization, because it would be contradictory for the European Union to impose an iron, albeit fair, discipline on itself, only for the United States and other major powers to then do the opposite and exploit what we fail to do. Therefore, it is right and necessary that these principles be established at the next round of negotiations at the World Trade Organization. Mr. President, the Director-General of the Directorate-General for Development said that preparing a report on the coherence of the various Union policies with development policy before the development policy document due in the spring has been presented would be putting the cart before the horse. It is irrelevant that the requirement for the Commission to submit an annual report, clearly defined in the Council resolution, was met only with a ""non-paper."" The real problem is that, at a time when global poverty is increasing, this horse is climbing the mountain and the cart onto which other EU policies are loaded is so heavy that development policy is slowly slipping behind. Development policy is constantly forgotten or treated as an afterthought when the European Union's most important political decisions are made. Take, for example, the new chocolate directive, which shows that EU countries spend more each year on chocolate than on development aid. There has been no proper assessment of the development impact of this directive, which, according to estimates by producing countries, 90% of which are our ACP partners, could result in income losses for cocoa producers of at least 15%. Take the fisheries agreements, which show how unsustainable current fishing practices in EU waters are. At the same time, we are negotiating joint ventures that will give large European fishing vessels expanded access to the waters of developing countries, which will put 190 million small-scale fishermen in those countries out of work worldwide. Consider the trade agreements. As Mr. Nielson said this morning with reference to the Lomé Convention, the preferential treatment applies only to ""essentially all products of the least developed countries."" In other words, poverty reduction becomes meaningless when the EU's commercial interests are at stake."	de
In this perspective, the strategy of separating the objective of preventing the deterioration of the state of surface and groundwater from the objectives of protecting, improving and restoring their quality should not be pursued, constituting a superfluous scale of priorities to the detriment of an organic nature of interventions and specific measures aimed at the combined approach and the use of the best available techniques. With regard to the elimination of pollution produced by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment, the optimization of the approach should include regulation, both at national and community level, to allow better identification of the different types of water bodies polluted as a consequence of human production activities. Finally, it is necessary to establish a system that prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances, through the greatest number of information about their chemical, physical and biological properties, in order to create an integrated model of intervention at different strategic levels, with the protection of the good water, which is fundamental for all of us. Mr President, the aim of the directive must be to ensure that Member States provide combined protection for surface water, groundwater and drinking water, and that the level of protection is compatible with existing Community environmental legislation. Let me point out that the decisions already adopted on the Nitrates Directive have not yet been implemented in several Member States, despite the fact that it is a Union decision. The proposal before us contains a series of more stringent provisions on the protection of the aquatic environment which go beyond the environmental objectives currently in force. The directive proposes that the ultimate objective for the marine environment must be achieved of concentrations close to the environmental concentration value for substances existing in nature and close to zero for synthetic substances attributable to human activity. Not only is this impossible, it is also against nature. The adoption of this report will have serious consequences for European agriculture, insofar as concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen cannot exceed the environmental concentration of these substances in the aquatic environment and insofar as we want to set a zero limit value for pesticides in the aquatic environment. European agriculture will therefore not be able to devote itself to the cultivation of bread-making cereals with a protein content high enough to allow the use of these cereals for bread-making. The result will be that agricultural production will shift to other countries outside the Union, with all the socio-economic and employment consequences that this entails. I will not be able to vote in favour of the provisions of the Water Framework Directive which deal with the aspects mentioned. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is a precious resource. Millions of people do not even have clean water, an essential prerequisite for survival. It is therefore not surprising that water is the underlying cause of certain wars. The capitalist world also places its pawns in order to exercise maximum control over water reserves. It rarely shows solidarity or thinks about the general interest. Europe therefore has a difficult task ahead of it: to integrate the EU water policy, fragmented in terms of both objectives and means, by creating a more cohesive framework regulation.	it
The importance of safety in road, rail and inland waterway transport is unquestionable and given the international nature of this type of transport, training courses for safety consultants must also be harmonized, such as for the upcoming new ADR. All this is important, but equally essential is the implementation of the existing regulations. There are several reasons to pay attention to this aspect, just look at how many accidents have occurred in recent years in fog in Belgium, or in the Netherlands or in other countries. There are many accidents involving trucks carrying dangerous goods that should not have been traveling in such weather conditions instead of being calmly on the roads. Or think of ships from Eastern European countries that sail in clearly dangerous conditions. Surveys conducted in Belgian, Finnish and even Japanese ports have also shown that 50 percent of containers containing partly dangerous goods are not delivered in compliance with the current regulations. In short, the importance of the topic is enormous. As regards the situation of safety consultants, in some Member States companies are required to have an internal one from 1 January this year. Currently, this regulation creates many problems, especially for smaller companies, which do not have sufficient financial resources. As a result, these companies are forced to give up their load or to mix it with another load, with the serious problems that this generates. For this reason, companies are required to integrate these activities in their financial statements, or in their business analyses, which may be included in ISO 9002 certifications. The regulatory framework is ready, now we have to deal with its implementation. Allow me to make one last point, still concerning the application of the regulations. Satisfactory agreements must be made with the Eastern European countries, since they will only join the relevant treaties from 1 July 2001, i.e. in just a year and a half. These countries currently enjoy a slight competitive advantage, which is not serious. However, I believe that priority should be given to the safety aspects of road, rail and inland waterway transport and that this part of the acquis communautaire should be presented to the candidate countries in good time. Madam President, in this Parliament, the importance of transport safety is regularly highlighted, and rightly so. The ever-increasing volumes of goods crossing Europe involve, consciously or not, all kinds of risks for personnel, the environment and society. Those who have to manage these risks must therefore meet very stringent requirements. The rules laid down in another directive, Directive 95/35/EC, appear to be adequate enough to provide responsible advice on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods. I am pleased that an agreement has been reached with the Council on minimum requirements for examinations of safety advisers, although I would have preferred to have drawn up uniform standards and programmes to ensure the equality of qualifications at international level.	it
Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to dwell for a moment on the role and structure of the guidelines, before moving on to the main observations and criticisms made by the rapporteur or the honourable Members. On the role and structure of the guidelines, the Chairman of the competent committee, Mr Hatzidakis, the rapporteur and Mrs McCarthy have pointed out that they are intended to assist national and regional authorities in preparing the programming strategy for Objectives 1, 2, 3 of the Structural Funds and their links with the Cohesion Fund. The Commission's priorities are presented on the basis of the experience gained in implementing the programmes and of current Community policies related to structural interventions. The aim is to ensure that these priorities contribute to better use, optimal and effective use of Community interventions, as many of you have hoped, including by making use at the appropriate time, Mr Bradbourn, of the performance reserve specifically designed to promote optimal and effective use of European public money. When I speak of optimal use, I mean both at national and regional level, and therefore, Mr Seppänen, when I speak of the national level, I am also referring to the link with the Cohesion Fund. This is in relation to the objective of the guidelines. In relation to the content, however, as the honourable Members know, the guidelines are structured around three strategic priorities which the rapporteur has recalled with great clarity and also with great passion, as I was able to see in her speech. The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create, in all sectors, but particularly in the private sector, as Mr Berend said, the maximum number of serious, solid and lasting jobs. Competitiveness of regional economies, of all regional economies, therefore, and in particular of Wales, Mr Evans, but not only of Wales. I would also like to add, since many of you felt that this was an omission, the regional economies of the European regions disadvantaged by their geographical remoteness, whether peripheral regions, island regions or of course the outermost regions, which are the most remote. In this regard, I could perhaps reply to Mr Ribeiro i Castro who asked me, as I wrote to the presidents of the outermost regions, that the Commission has asked for a few weeks' extension for the publication of its report. We received the memoranda from the governments of the outermost regions very late, but this is certainly not intended to be an alibi, but rather an explanation. Extremely serious work needs to be done on these memoranda. I personally attended a meeting of the outermost regions on 23 November and the College felt that a few more weeks were needed to draft a report that was up to the extremely serious and grave problems and expectations of these outermost regions and I thank you for your understanding. That is the first priority, namely the competitiveness of regional economies. The second priority, on which many of you have insisted, in particular the Honourable Member Puerta and others - far be it from me to want to establish a hierarchical order between them - is the strengthening of social cohesion and employment, especially by valorising human resources, better than in the past.	it
Mr. President, this has been a very useful debate. One or two speakers have referred to specific issues that we have been strongly advised to think about carefully. For example, Mrs. Maij-Weggen spoke about both Indonesia and Burma, and she made some important points about those countries and the human rights situation there. I would like to focus very briefly on one or two topics that have been raised regularly throughout the debate. One of the very first speakers, Mr. Wuori, referred to the remarks made today by Mr. Havel. That was a remarkable speech, and I hope that Mr. Gollnisch, who is no longer able to be with us, was also able to hear it. I also hope, if there is life in space, as Mr. Newton Dunn has speculated, that she too was able to hear Mr. Havel's speech. The latter reminded us that our Union is not just about markets, about GDP growth, that it is a union of values, which is reflected in the Treaties and in our obligations in terms of external aid as a whole, which is reflected quite specifically in what we are mandated to do. How do we implement what the Treaties say about development aid programs? One or two honorable Members, Mr. Feber and Mr. Cushnahan, talked about the gulf between rhetoric and reality. Mr. Cashman said, and he is right in a sense, that words are no substitute for real action. Of course, words can make a small difference, as Mrs. Malmström pointed out. She said that she had received a letter from the Chinese Ambassador, a very kind and very intelligent representative and servant of his country, telling her that she was wrong and that the European Parliament was taking the wrong attitude towards human rights in China. I think that after her speech, she will receive a mountain of letters from the Chinese authorities. She will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters concerning what is claimed to be the real situation in China. I think she reflected the views of many non-governmental organizations, many people who admire Chinese civilization but who are concerned about what is happening in China today. Obviously, it is absolutely true that we must consider action, and the very first speech, given by Mr. Salafranca, mentioned two separate issues from Geneva, which concerned action. One of them, of course, is made possible by the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of European taxpayers—namely, the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities—about €100 million that is spent through programs, for which I am responsible, and which go mainly to non-governmental organizations to promote human rights and democratization. We will need to share with Parliament, as the vicars say, our views on how best to focus and target this spending programme to support human rights in the years ahead.	fr
"That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like. All I can do at this point is promise that I will strive to achieve it. Let me first wish the Commissioner a Happy St. David's Day. Thank you for that introduction. It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a real waste of time unless contact is re-established with the citizens of Europe. That is what we must be fully focused on at all times. It must provide them with a service, and the recommendations to reduce payment times will, I am sure, be welcomed, but the other complaint we regularly hear from the citizens we represent is about red tape, excessive red tape. Is there any reference to reducing red tape and bureaucracy for applicants for European funding with the guarantee of financial control? That is a specific complaint we are hearing. We must address it. The other question I would like to ask concerns the Audit Progress Committee. This committee is, of course, welcome, but I think it is essential that it includes a reference to the scrutiny of the European Parliament's recommendations in our discharge procedure. Will you add this to the work of your Audit Progress Committee? Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and accountability, and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, on your actions, not your words. The task of reconnecting the Commission with the citizens of Europe is critical, as Mrs Morgan said. It can only be achieved through actions, not words. I say this with some deference within the European Parliament because there are many experts in words, but we will try to lead by example. On the issue of excessive red tape, Mrs Morgan explained the dilemma well. We hate excessive paperwork, but given the requirements for control, additional control, and re-verification to ensure effective financial control, sometimes the demands of administration, which some call ""bureaucracy,"" are unavoidable. However, with a view to reducing these obligations as much as possible, we are not just talking about it; we will appoint, in the not too distant future, a Deputy Secretary-General, an additional Deputy Secretary-General, whose specific mandate and task will be to identify best practices and disseminate them within the Commission; he will also have to ensure a radical reduction in the procedures that cause so much paperwork, so much bureaucracy, and, I would also say, so much frustration, not only among citizens and businesses in the Union, but also among all the people who work for the Commission. Certainly, we will strive to achieve this, and I believe that the effects will begin to be felt in the coming years. One of our difficulties will always be, of course, that the more effective we are at reform, the less people will know about it. So we will be counting on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain, with their usual generosity, all the efforts that the Commission is making to properly serve the citizens of Europe."	fr
They live in areas that should benefit from these projects. If we achieve this from the perspective of this triple focus, I believe that these families, these individuals, these European citizens will believe more in Europe, and this seems very important to me because, ultimately, cities will increasingly be the protagonists of European life. (FR) Mr. President, before my colleagues and friends, Mr. Franz Fischler and Mrs. Anna Diamantopoulou, speak in turn—given that the three of us in charge of these four Community initiatives have been fortunate enough to follow this debate with the same attention—I would like to reiterate the evocation of URBAN and Interreg, which many of you have recalled and on which you have spoken. I would like to express my gratitude at the outset to the rapporteurs from the committees, from all of them, and also to the speakers from the groups and to each and every one of you for the excellent quality and the great interest that your interventions reveal in relation to these two initiatives. In particular, what Ms. Arlene McCarthy said about Urban is very true. I would like to thank her not only for the work and the report she has presented, but also, why not say it myself, for everything we owe her, what you owe her in relation to this initiative, which we also owe, more generally, to your Parliament. Indeed, I have not forgotten that it was the European Parliament that politically decided and desired the continuation of this initiative to promote the regeneration of urban areas in crisis, to promote sustainable urban development, while generating this integrated approach, which we so appreciate, to jointly address economic, social, and environmental aspects. Other points of agreement underlined by Ms. Arlene McCarthy's report are: the effectiveness of this instrument through financial concentration and a critical mass for interventions; the horizontal mechanism—which, in our view, is more conducive to disseminating results and multiplying exchanges of experiences and effective practices; and, finally, the growing role of local authorities in the design and management of programs, based on a genuine partnership. Having recalled the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission's proposals and your Parliament, and having emphasized my great interest in listening to the various contributions, I would like to respond to some criticisms and suggestions that have been made, apologizing in advance for not being able to personally quote each of those who spoke. I believe, however, that everyone will be able to identify with my remarks. First, the Urban program, and the maximum limit of fifty cities, which some of you have described as arbitrary. I understand this concern. I have therefore asked my services to be prepared to consider a reasonable increase in the number of cities that will be eligible for the Urban programme, subject to certain guarantees, relating firstly to concentration - I am thinking specifically of intervention zones, which must have a minimum of 20,000 inhabitants and, exceptionally, 10,000 - and secondly, to critical financial mass: we should stick to the figure of 500 euros per inhabitant so that the European Union's intervention is both effective and legible, and so that it does not appear to be some kind of superficial cosmetic that would offer no meaning either to citizens or to local authorities.	es
It is very helpful and I consider it a very good contribution from Mr Swoboda and his colleagues. We are very grateful for the way in which he has been able to conduct the work on this issue and for the contribution of some of his colleagues, some of whom are here this evening - Mr Pack, Mr Lagendijk and others. I am pleased that overall our relations with FYROM are so good, and perhaps Mr Dupuis, and his interpreter, will forgive me if I use this expression in a spirit of entente cordiale. This has been achieved thanks to the excellent representative of the European Union in the country, who is a great friend of Parliament and a great servant of the Commission. The imminent start of negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is the most significant example of our good relations. The same can be said of FYROM's cooperation in the reconstruction of Kosovo. I am grateful to the authorities of Macedonia for the assistance they have provided in recent weeks in helping to address the considerable difficulties encountered in the supply of electricity in Kosovo. Like the honourable Members, I recognise the stabilising role played by this country during the tragedy in the Balkans, in particular with regard to the integration of the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country. I saw the newly elected President Georgievski a few weeks ago and was extremely impressed, like others, by his commitment to multi-ethnicity and pluralism. If I may, I would like to explain how things stand with regard to the negotiations which - as Mr Lagendijk said - other countries in the region are looking at with great interest. On 24 January this year, the Council adopted negotiating directives for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which represents the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process in the Western Balkans launched by the Commission in May 1999. Let me clarify the main elements of these draft directives, which provide for the inclusion in the agreement of provisions for establishing a political dialogue with FYROM, including provisions for improved regional cooperation, including the prospect of creating free trade areas between the countries of the region, although I must make it clear that any attempt to recreate the State of Yugoslavia is out of the question. They also cover the prospect of creating a free trade area between the European Union and the countries of the region within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement, provisions on the free movement of workers, the right of establishment, the provision of services, payments and capital movements, a commitment by FYROM to approximate its legislation to that of the European Union, in particular in key areas of the internal market, and provisions on cooperation with FYROM in a wide variety of fields, including justice and home affairs. The Commission is now making all the necessary preparations to ensure that negotiations can start in March. I will be visiting FYROM in the second week of March. I hope to be able to start the process then, although formal negotiations will start soon after.	it
What is the Commission's position on these considerations? Yugoslavia is also a weak link in stability and therefore poses a threat to the stability of Macedonia. We must await further developments in the situation. The climate in Belgrade is becoming more and more uncertain. However, we support the Council's decision to change the tone of the sanctions. This decision is at least a serious attempt to support the opposition, which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations. What does the European Union intend to do in this regard, if the opposition's demand for early elections is accepted? What can we still do to support the opposition? Mr President, Kosovo was hopefully the last case in which international law was interpreted as the right of a dictatorial leadership to persecute minorities in the most appalling way, with the argument that 'these are internal matters'. By the time the United States and NATO, and finally the European Union, decided to act, it was too late. If, for example, the Union had acted earlier and more clearly, much suffering would have been avoided. The European Union therefore now has a special responsibility in terms of aid, assistance and reconstruction in the Balkans. Our ultimate goal must remain to create the conditions that will allow all the countries of south-eastern Europe to integrate with the rest of the Union, economically, commercially and politically. Trade and economic integration are the best way to create fertile ground for democracy in a corner of Europe so devastated by war. We liberals are prepared to do a lot and to do it quickly, just as Paolo Costa has illustrated. We therefore welcome with great satisfaction the proposal for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for his excellent report. Macedonia deserves our help, also in recognition of the sacrifices and the generous work done by the people of Macedonia and their leaders during the war in Kosovo. Now that Macedonia is freeing itself from the destructive grip of communism and nationalism, we are clearly obliged to act and provide our assistance. Just as we will have to do for the other Balkan states. This is a duty for the Union. Mr President, in this context I would like to remind Members - not least in the light of a debate already held in the course of the evening - that the man who bears the main responsibility for the war, for the humiliation of human beings, for the massacres, and for the expulsion of innocent people from their homes still governs the rest of Yugoslavia, Serbia. The man who is accused of genocide and who should be tried by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague is still at large. I am talking about Milosevic. As long as Milosevic remains in power and Serbia does not take the path of democracy, Serbia will represent a constant threat to peace in the entire Balkan area and also to Macedonia. Mr President, this agreement will be the first step towards the implementation of the Stability Pact in South-Eastern Europe.	it
We must take into account the views of fishermen. We must take into account the concerns of fishermen and we must work closely with them. I hope that you, as the Commissioner responsible for fisheries, will be aware of this gap and will try to work as closely as possible to bring all parties together and to ensure that their views are taken into account. Thank you, Commissioner Fischler. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. Insolvency proceedings The next item is the report (A5-0039/2000) by Mr Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council regulation on insolvency proceedings (9178/1999 - C5-0069/1999 - 1999/0806(CNS)). Mr President, I believe that we all agree on the creation of a European judicial area. We also all agree that there should be harmonization in an area marked by extreme disparity in our legal systems, and even more so in concepts. The very word insolvency, the legal concept of insolvency, does not cover the same accounting notion in each of the Member States of the Union. So we agree on the observation, and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction. If I may, I will make a few observations, however, on the method. When we acknowledge - and we could not do otherwise - the disparity of legal systems and concepts, and we want to move towards better coordination, I believe there are three ways of proceeding. The first is to make equivalences by saying: ultimately, insolvency in France is the same thing as insolvency in England or in Germany. The second way to proceed is to recreate a law ex nihilo, that is to say to harmonize the systems, to completely overhaul all the concepts and legal systems in each of the States. This is not the path that has been taken. The third path that has been taken is ultimately to superimpose, on top of the existing systems, which are not touched, a veritable embryo of Community law on collective procedures and companies in difficulty. This is a good thing, moreover, and the result has probably exceeded the ambition of the authors. But at this stage I would like to make an observation, which is not technical, but more philosophical and inspired by practice. It is that insolvency is experienced in the European Union, in most States, as an absolutely definitive event for the person who experiences it. And I think it is our responsibility, in an economy that is moving faster and faster, where everyone must have a chance and a real chance, to give people the chance to try a business venture, and a second, a third chance if necessary.	fr
At the request of a French MP, Mr. Zimeray, a petition has already been submitted; it has collected many signatures, including mine. However, I ask you, in accordance with the direction now constantly expressed by the European Parliament and the entire European Community, to intervene with the President and Governor of Texas, Mr. Bush, by using the prestige of your mandate and of the Institution you represent, because it is Mr. Bush who has the power to suspend the death sentence and pardon the condemned man. And all this while respecting the principles we have always upheld. Thank you, Mr. Segni; I will do so with pleasure. This is indeed entirely in line with the positions our Parliament has always adopted. Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to a case that has regularly been dealt with by Parliament. It is the case of Alexander Nikitin. We are all pleased in this House that the court ordered his release and clearly established that, in Russia too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right. However, it appears that he is being indicted again, as the public prosecutor has appealed. We know, and have established this in numerous resolutions – including during the last part-session last year – that this case is not only of a legal nature and that it is wrong to accuse Alexander Nikitin of criminal activity and treason because we are concerned with its results and we benefit from them. These results form the basis of the European programs for the protection of the Barents Sea, and that is why I ask you to consider a draft letter outlining the essential facts of this case and to inform Russia of the position that follows from Parliament's decisions. Yes, Mrs Schroedter, I will be happy to examine the facts relating to this matter when I receive your letter. Madam President, I would first like to congratulate you on keeping your word because, indeed, during this first part-session, in this new year, the number of television channels has been significantly increased in our premises. However, Madam President, what I requested has not been achieved. There are two Finnish channels and one Portuguese channel, but there is still no Dutch channel. Yet I asked you for a Dutch channel, because the Dutch also want to be able to follow the news every month when they are sent to this land of exile. I therefore ask you once again to take the necessary steps to ensure that we have a Dutch channel. Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this issue is on the agenda for the Quaestors' meeting on Wednesday. It will, I hope, be examined in a positive spirit. Madam President, how is it that Parliament does not comply with the health and safety regulations it votes on? How come no air quality tests have been conducted in this building since we were elected?	fr
In this context, the most delicate problem arises: how does a European Public Prosecutor fit into relations with the various national communities and with the justice system, as it is structured? I believe this issue still needs to be addressed from both a cultural and a practical perspective. Today, we run the risk of superimposing a new institution on top of the multiple and diverse institutions that already exist in each of the States. Mr. President, I will briefly address two issues. First, I do not wish to comment on the philosophical aspects of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of the Member States, although I strongly support their debate. As a regular viewer of British television, I am aware of the complaints of British national politicians about what they consider a threat from the continent to their national legal culture. Sometimes they border on the theatrical, and I believe this merits a debate. However, this is not the topic I wish to address. The topic that interests me is Mrs. Theato's report. I believe that, given the legal difficulties this issue raises—and it is clear that the European Union only has a very narrow path to ensuring that these crimes are prosecuted as European crimes—the legal path has been lost. I am referring to recommendations 1 and 2. They no longer refer to a European prosecutor but, for legal reasons, have now become an independent European authority, a body Ms. Theato previously called for. In this regard, it is clear that we have difficulties with the legal basis. We also have difficulties with the crimes. This point has not been changed. It continues to include crimes that to some extent go beyond, or at least could go beyond, the scope of European crimes, such as money laundering and receiving stolen goods, and criminal association. In this context, it seems to me that some legally confusing points remain, which should be clarified. Even so, it is essential—and this is why we will vote in favor of point 1, excluding this recommendation—that Parliament sends a clear signal to the Commission and the Council of our desire to put an end, through a clear legislative act, to the situations that have taken root. Mr. President, Parliament has, for years, called for specific and uniform criminal protection of the Union's financial interests. The truth is that frustration increases when one realizes the fragility of the Convention (and the protocols relating to such protection), which, five years after its signature, has still not been ratified or entered into force. Moreover, more voluntaristic attempts, such as the current OLAF, fail to overcome legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights. The proposals in Mrs. Theato's report, which call on the Commission to submit a substantive legislative act on the criminal protection of financial interests, defining the offences, particularly fraud against the Community budget, are, in our view, a serious attempt to establish a new and increasingly necessary uniform Community criminal law.	es
"Thank you very much, Honourable Member. Allow me to congratulate you on what is known in German parliamentary circles—unjustifiably in your case—as the ""debut speech"" (Jungfernrede). Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague Robert Goebbels, who had to be absent for a political commitment. Within the Economic and Monetary Committee, the Jonckheer report has sparked bitter controversies regarding the functioning of the market. A narrow right-wing majority has succeeded in eliminating any reference to the market's shortcomings. Even if our Parliament were to pursue this ultra-liberal concept of a supposedly perfect market, the world would not change. Economic relations in the real world amply demonstrate that the elimination of all government intervention in the market by no means produces perfect competition or an optimal distribution of resources. Although the market has been the privileged place of exchange between human beings since the dawn of time, it has never been perfect. The market prioritizes the short term and immediate profits. In the market, the balance of power between supply and demand generally works to the disadvantage of the weakest, consumers and workers. The market requires rules to function. The necessary and precious spirit of initiative must have as its corollary a sense of responsibility to society. We, European socialists, are in favor of a market economy with social goals. The market is not an end in itself; it must serve the improvement of the human condition. The European Union, the states, must not replace economic agents; rather, public authorities must define the rules and objectives that allow for sustainable economic development. Finally, aid makes it possible to carry out restructuring, offer training, save jobs, and, ultimately, act wisely. The Union's competition policy cannot have as its primary objective a reduction in the overall level of aid. This aid must be directed toward the Union's objectives, in particular, economic and social cohesion, sustainable development, and research. The Commission must pursue illegal aid and aid that actually hinders the internal market. Eliminating all public aid would be a grave mistake. The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research funded by the US military. The World Wide Web, which has made possible the meteoric rise of the information society, was the work of CERN in Geneva, financed, once again, with public aid. The German government's bailout of the Holzmann group has been criticized as an unjustifiable hindrance to the market economy. President Duisenberg has even tried to attribute the euro's relative weakness against the dollar to this state intervention. I have not heard Mr. Duisenberg criticize the bailout of the LTCM Hedge Fund by the US monetary authorities. Wanting to save 60,000 jobs is apparently a sin against the market, but the bailout of capital does not seem to pose any problems for defenders of the free market."	es
I therefore ask you, Madam President, to ask the Commission to speak now and then proceed to the vote. (Applause from the PSE Group) Madam President, first of all, I would like to make it perfectly clear that the Commission has the greatest respect for the decisions of this Parliament, and in particular for the one concerning the setting of the agenda. We therefore respect any decisions that Parliament may take in this regard. But I would also like to make it perfectly clear that President Prodi has undertaken with Parliament to establish a new debate, as Mr Barón pointed out, in addition to the annual debate on the Commission's legislative programme, on the broad lines of action for the next five-year period, that is, for this legislature. I would like to say, Madam President, that, in the agreement reached in September, this debate differs from the annual presentation of the Commission's legislative programme. I would add, Madam President, that, on the Commission side, we are ready and willing to organize this debate whenever it suits you, that we were ready to develop it this week, as was originally decided, based on the fact that it was presented the day before in a speech to the parliamentary groups. I would therefore like to repeat, Madam President, that, for our part, we have discussed the action programme for the next five years and that we are ready to come and present the programme for the next five years whenever Parliament decides, including this week, if that is its decision, and the programme for the year 2000 next month, on which we were in complete agreement. I propose that we vote on the Socialist Group's request to reinstate the Commission's statement on its strategic objectives. (Parliament rejects the request) The President. Still on the subject of Wednesday, I have another proposal concerning the oral question on capital gains tax. The PPEDE Group requests that this item be removed from the agenda. Is there a colleague who would like to speak on behalf of the group and justify this request? Madam President, in response to the laughter I hear among the Socialists, I have been told that large sections of the Socialist Group would also like to remove this item from the agenda because, during the vote in the Conference of Presidents, the responsible colleagues of the Socialist Group did not have the vote of the working group. I do not know if this information is correct, but in any case, the PPE-DE Group would be grateful if you would remove this item from the agenda because Parliament has indeed addressed this issue many times. There are decisions opposing such a tax. That is why my group requests that this item be removed from the agenda. Thank you, Mr Poettering. We now hear Mr Wurtz, who speaks against this request. Madam President, I would first like to point out Mr Poettering's lack of logic.	fr
I have received 7 motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, to close this statement. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday. Cyprus and Malta The next item is the joint debate on: the Council declaration on the position of the European Union on developments in the Cyprus question; the report (A4-0029/2000) by Mr. Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of measures within the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta [COM(1999)0535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)]. Mr. Seixas da Costa has the floor on behalf of the Council. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I would like to provide some information on the resumption of intra-Cypriot negotiations and recent developments on this issue. I believe that what happened in Helsinki at the end of last year and the new atmosphere prevailing, particularly within the framework of the relationship between the European Union and Turkey, reflect—as is evident to all—a backdrop at the Community level to which the very framework of relations between the two communities, within the context of Cyprus, cannot fail to be sensitive. I would like to emphasize that at the beginning of December last year, the first round of negotiations—which had been interrupted for several years—between the northern and southern Cypriot communities of the island was held in New York. These were indirect talks mediated by the United Nations Special Representative, Álvaro de Souto. In January of this year—starting on January 31—another round was held, and a third round is scheduled to begin in New York on May 23. There is a possibility, not yet fully confirmed, that these talks will be direct and ongoing, extending their work until September of this year. The substantive aspects of this debate are essentially four: security, governmental structure, territorial adjustments, and refugees and compensation resulting from the situation created after the division of the island. However, it had been agreed that other issues could be included, so the representative of the northern part of the island, Rauf Denktash, proposed three new topics: sovereignty, confidence-building measures, and the lifting of the embargo on products from the north of the island. The talks held so far have yielded two essential results: the possibility of structuring a direct channel of information between the European Union and the northern part of the island—without necessarily implying its recognition as an entity with legal personality at the international level—is emerging, in order to facilitate the adoption of a Community acquis for the possible accession of the entire island, should a resolution to the overall problem of the island's division be achieved in the meantime. The second result, which we consider important, is the statement made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the end of the first day of talks, stating that, if a comprehensive agreement on the situation were reached, it would entail recognition of the specific characteristics of the north of the island.	es
This is the only way for Cambodians to forgive those who were merely followers and for a lasting peace. Mr President, this week it became known that two major Cambodian opposition newspapers were threatened with closure because they had insulted the King and the Prime Minister. These are newspapers that actively support opposition leader Sam Rengie, who is currently being stripped of his parliamentary immunity so that he can be tried for treason. In his millennium speech, Sam Rengie dared to say that the succession procedure for King Sihanouk must be clarified - if he ever dies. In March last year, a member of Sam Rengie's party was killed by a group of people in military uniform in Kandal province. In September, two party members were arrested for their involvement in a rocket attack on the Prime Minister. It is worth noting that this is the only party in Cambodia that does not have an armed wing. In October, a member of parliament from the same party was kidnapped by men in uniform and released after a ransom was paid. The campaign of intimidation is evident. In Cambodia, much more is happening: torture of prisoners, involvement of the army and police in trafficking of minors and women, and excessive use of pre-trial detention. All this is the order of the day. Even more serious is the government's refusal to have the leaders of the Khmer Rouge tried by an international tribunal. It is true that the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tensions are less accentuated. The way in which the political opposition is treated is a source of serious concern and, if the situation does not change, this will also have repercussions on relations between the European Union and Cambodia. Mr President, a new doctrine is increasingly imposing itself in international law, according to which no state can afford to treat its own citizens and residents as it wishes. Despite the presence of a democratically elected government, even the principle of national sovereignty is no longer sufficient to prevent third countries from intervening in cases of clear violations of human rights. Clear examples of this are the Pinochet-Ugarte case, the crisis in Kosovo and, in a more moderate form, the debate within the European Union about the new Austrian government. In Cambodia, however, this trend risks coming to nothing if those responsible for the former revolutionary government are not brought to justice. At the same time, the fight against impunity is also being jeopardised. This should remind us that ratification of the treaty establishing an international criminal court has been shamefully slow. Mr President, yesterday's debate on human rights was extremely useful; I am pleased with this further opportunity to look at the situation in some regions of the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights has proved to be a very difficult task.	it
The regulation might mislead one into thinking that this is the case, but in reality this is not the case. The Commission has not made any changes to the regulation for years, despite Parliament having long called for this. In practice, this means that in the short term these regions are once again reduced to receiving only the funds for peripheral regions. Parliament has been calling since 1996 for a common fund for cooperation with third countries to be set up to overcome the difficulties in this area, but nothing has been done! The problems continue to drag on, to the detriment of the regions concerned. Parliament once again calls for improved and extended cross-border cooperation, for a common fund to be set up and for further changes to the regulation in cooperation with the other Commissioners. We want a Europe that responds to the needs of citizens, not a Europe of bureaucrats! Mr President, a third of the Union budget goes into development funding, which my group finds excellent, provided that this eliminates the development gap in regions, cities and groups of people, or improves the health and environmental situation. It is a question of solidarity and progress. But the distribution of ever-larger sums of money is no guarantee that the way in which these funds are spent will improve. The municipalities and regions that benefit from these funds have gained some experience in the meantime and find that it is incredibly difficult to invest the money in the areas that need it most. Projects related to economic growth and infrastructure usually produce quite satisfactory results, while projects in the social and environmental fields are not always guaranteed to be approved. Given the great uncertainty surrounding the interpretation of the rules, the regions and municipalities seek the assistance of expensive consultancy firms. These experts are tasked with estimating the extent to which European Commission officials are prepared to approve the plans submitted. In some cases, I have the impression that it is not a question of solidarity or of solving the most urgent problems, but rather that it is aimed at maintaining vested interests and propaganda for the blessings that come from the European Union. It seems to me that the possibility of displaying a billboard saying that such and such a project is co-financed by the European Union has become the main aim. Too much money is spent on propaganda and consultancy firms, on consultations and controls, and much of the money ultimately goes back to the coffers of the Member State that originally paid it. After the expected accession of new Member States, whose standard of living is one to two thirds of the average of the current Member States of the European Union, such a waste of resources will generate even more opposition. In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Confederal Group of the European United Left agreed with the rapporteur for the opinion on the LEADER programme, Mr Nogueira Román, who rightly stated that it is not wise to disperse resources across all rural areas.	it
It would therefore be extremely important to incorporate this cumulative requirement. Finally, I would like to reiterate that, in my opinion, Mr Di Pietro has done an excellent job in presenting a report which, in the context of the limited opportunities available, offers all possible guarantees for the protection of individual rights and fundamental freedoms. However, if we want to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we must strengthen legal assistance. Mr President, my group welcomes the fact that a convention is being launched to frame the daily practice of legal assistance in criminal matters in a specific regulation. The proposal under consideration is complex, because it analyses the agreements in force between the Member States, but it has profound consequences for the relationship between the State and its citizens. The Council's proposal highlights enormous shortcomings precisely in the field of legal protection. According to the rapporteur, Mr Di Pietro, the proposal actually contains colossal gaps. The convention makes possible a whole chain of requests for legal assistance, involving the authorities and judicial systems of other Member States in a cascade. The way in which this practice is regulated means that the abovementioned chain cannot be kept under control in its entirety by any magistrate. Supplementary measures must therefore be adopted, such as the obligation for investigators to testify, when requested, in any criminal proceedings in which the material they have collected is used. My group also takes a disfavored view of the fact that the Council proposal tramples on the principle of proportionality. There are no limitations on the scope of application, so the convention does not only concern the fight against the most serious crimes and organised crime. Nowhere is it written that it concerns only criminal law, so it is not unthinkable that the European Union will soon use heavy weapons to fight petty crime and that citizens' rights will disappear, suffocated by the smoke of gunpowder. Mr President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, which we are examining today, contains the bare minimum for effective and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies. It concerns notifications, the exchange of information, the temporary transfer of prisoners, the restitution of assets, testimonies by videoconference, investigative and so-called undercover activities, telephone interceptions, and more. It is the least that can be agreed upon, and it must be said straight away that, if some amendments were to pass, such as for example no. 32 or no. 81, the revised no. 70 or the revised no. 71, the whole convention would be reduced to the exchange of notifications or information and would really have to be thrown in the bin, and we would vote against it. I hope that the good sense of my colleagues in the various groups will lead them to reject these amendments. The fact that this has not become a framework agreement but has remained at the level of conventions is also a defeat for Parliament. As Commissioner Vitorino will have noted from all the various interventions, the need to develop a framework of common rules emerges, that is, to no longer go on like this, with this scattered order, with these small conventions that concern various sectors such as investigations or others.	it
In the system in use in the northern Member States, however, the financial component is applied differently. Everyone has to pay, regardless of whether they dump their waste at sea or deliver it. There is also a kind of economic incentive built into this system that encourages ships to deliver their waste to port. It is a well-tested system that has been researched and proven to be effective. That is one of the reasons why Parliament and the committee whose work I am called upon to defend insist on the need to maintain a percentage of indirect costs and integrate it into anchorage charges. I will now explain in detail the essence of our proposal. The percentage applied must be 90 percent, first point. We could also decide on 75 percent, but in any case we need to ensure a solid and consistent basis, otherwise we will once again find ourselves with a plethora of different systems before we have, so to speak, learned the lesson that we actually already know. I would therefore like to convince everyone that for the reasons I have given, it is reasonable to opt for a system that integrates indirect costs in one way or another into anchor charges. The Commission proposal in its current form leaves the Member State free to reduce indirect costs to 0.01 percent if it so wishes. And I fear that in practice everyone will do exactly that. This will be the most important aspect on which we will have to focus our exchanges in the future. There are many other elements in the proposal, and we have reached agreement on many of them. I am convinced that we will be able to find a solution, but what I have explained to you is the crux of the whole issue, to which I wanted to draw everyone's full attention. Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to stress that we have had an excellent discussion in the two readings. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, very much for taking up the dossier and for explaining it so well. We agree with the Council on three points. Firstly, all European ports that do not yet have them must build adequate collection facilities for ship waste. The presence of these facilities is therefore mandatory. Secondly, all ships, regardless of their flag, must dispose of the waste they generate. Thirdly, the costs must be charged to the ship in question. We agree on these points. In practice, we want to set up a system together to prevent economic incentives to throw waste into the sea. Firstly, we want to protect flora and fauna, and secondly, there are many coasts where not only do many tourists arrive, but where jobs need to be created. In short, we want an effective system. How does our position differ from that of the Council, apart from a few small details, such as the exemption from bureaucratic provisions that we are asking for museum ships and the somewhat stricter provisions that we want for large fishing vessels and pleasure boats?	it
"That's why, as discussed in committee, I have now proposed an amendment to Amendment 2, which includes the abandonment of the term ""harmonization."" This is done in the knowledge that the Council is meeting us halfway, and that we can then meet the Council halfway in return, because I believe this directive is a sensible step forward. Nevertheless, and the Council must know this, it is of course sensible for the Member States in the Council to coordinate such controls and threatened sanctions sooner or later. It would be absurd if, for example, in Finland, violations were punishable by almost a prison sentence, while in a southern country, only a small fine was imposed, or vice versa. That makes no sense. That's not European either. Therefore, I would like to reiterate the procedure: Amendment 3 replaces Amendment 2, which was voted on by the committee. It would therefore have to be voted on first tomorrow. I would be very grateful if this could be communicated to the Bureau, which will preside over the vote tomorrow. Then we wouldn't have a procedural problem. So first, let's vote on Amendment 3. That would then replace Amendment 2. That's how it was discussed in committee, and then we could have this regulation very quickly and avoid having to resort to a complex conciliation procedure for a solution that, in principle, makes sense. Mr President, everything has been said. Please allow me to build a bridge for the Vice-President so that she might support Amendment 3, which replaces Amendment 2. There are sometimes Members in this Chamber who say: It does make sense to standardize traffic controls in terms of their severity and intensity. But when the term ""harmonization of sanctions"" is mentioned, some in this Chamber flinch—left and right, top and bottom of this House. That's why I think Amendment 3, which Mr Piecyk, as rapporteur, has drafted, is wonderful. He avoided the word ""harmonization"" altogether. But he did say what it was about. He said that it cannot be that the use of a commercial vehicle, a bus with passengers, without observing safety regulations – which endangers people's lives and limbs – is considered a minor offense in one country and severely punished in another. However, this would be necessary given the danger to passengers and other road users. Therefore, the question here is not: are we for subsidiarity or centrality? The point is that it is not acceptable for us to have the common goal of road safety, but some governments say: well, in terms of penalties, we treat road safety violations like violations of the ban on entering certain green spaces, and the others give it the right weight. First principle, Madam Vice-President: equal consideration of the need to improve road safety. The second argument is that there must be no distortion of competition within the Community. There are certainly examples where, in one country, the trucks of another Member State are subjected to particularly strict controls and severe sanctions, detention, etc., while in another country it makes no difference at all. This is the core of the difference between Parliament and the common position: We do believe that, in relation to sanctions, which remain within their national competence, Member States should try to coordinate their efforts from the perspective of: How do I assess the threat to traffic and how do I ensure equal competition within the Community in a single market?"	de
I would like to address a very important point regarding the impact on businesses, raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs, and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: this concerns SMEs. Many speakers have emphasized this. The Commission pays particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs. We are proposing a system that significantly improves legal certainty for SMEs. Why? Is this simply a political gesture? No. In this system, we propose to reform our important rules in such a way that most SMEs are covered by block exemption regulations, as in the area of vertical restraints. Most SMEs have less than a 30% market share. We have a de minimis opinion containing the following statement: since SMEs are not involved in market dominance, they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition contained in Article 81(1). We are currently developing additional block exemptions and guidelines, all of which will take into account the special situation of SMEs. Furthermore, our White Paper on Modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, firstly by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the current notification system and secondly, by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which will benefit SMEs in particular. (IT) Fourthly, legal certainty. Certainly, Mr Evans, legal certainty is – I am the first to acknowledge this – essential for businesses and not only for the legal professions, which nevertheless play a very important role in promoting European integration. Legal certainty is essential for businesses; it is one of the issues whose importance was also highlighted in her last speech by the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi – whom I thank for her way of following the issues relating to the single market in the broad sense and therefore, in this case, competition as well. I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons: it will allow, without prior decision, under the direct effect of Article 81(3), all agreements restricting competition that meet the conditions for exemption; it will allow businesses to be assisted in cases of doubt regarding interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions; and it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines aimed at clarifying the rules and ensuring certainty. Mrs Thyssen also referred to the issue of legal privilege for company lawyers. Let me just point out that the Court of Justice ruled on this issue, as you know better than I, in 1982. This case law remains valid and there is no reason to call it into question. The White Paper requires a re-examination of the issue in only one respect: the exchange of confidential information. The guarantees that must be given to businesses are currently under discussion. (IT) I now come, Mr President, briefly to the report by Mr Rapkay, whom I thank warmly for the quality of his work and for the overall support given to the Commission's 28th annual report on competition policy.	fr
However, accurately understanding and assessing all situations and expectations is a task that is virtually impossible. I belong to a country whose southern half faces the Mediterranean, and where water availability historically responds to the whims of a volatile climate and a difficult terrain. The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development, trying to overcome this adversity century after century, year after year, day after day, right up to the present day. Therefore, we believe that the practical application of the directive's obligation contained in Article 164 of the Treaty, which requires Community legislation to take into account the diversity of its regions, is essential. Precisely in application of this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People's Party will oppose Amendments 4 (Recital 21), 13, and 49 (Article 11(d)), as they represent a serious limitation for an area of exclusive management by the Member States, such as the regulation of their water resources. It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for its regulation in the different regions, given the different internal balances that are always at stake and which in any case require an in-depth knowledge of the different areas and interests involved. We also reject the amendments that seek to incorporate the full cost of water for 2010. Undoubtedly, we must set water prices that incentivize its efficient use but, at the same time, maintain the competitiveness of the productive sectors in the most disadvantaged regions and do not impede their legitimate development. Finally, I would like to refer to the amendments relating to hazardous substances, which establish that a zero or near-zero pollution level must be achieved. Zero pollution has not yet been achieved for any human activity. Ladies and gentlemen, we would be doing a disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are unable to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to ensure compliance. I hope that, once again, this Parliament will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, seeking an appropriate balance between environmental objectives and economic and social considerations, the three essential elements for achieving the sustainable development we all so desire. Mr. President, Commissioner, this is a very important directive. Its objective is to improve water quality and the safety of distribution systems. Citizens must have the right to clean water. This is important for both the environment and public health. I am not speaking so much on my own behalf, as I happen to be one of the small group of privileged Europeans who can drink water directly from the nearest lake in the neighborhood. We must strive to ensure that improvements in water quality are implemented quickly. Let us start working now. We cannot afford delays. It is important that the timetable be ambitious. In my opinion, it's not too ambitious, considering the goal is to stop discharging impurities into water by 2020 and aim to reduce the rate of discharge of impurities and harmful materials to zero by that date.	es
"As is well known, the European Commission should have presented new proposals by the end of 1998 to amend Directive 97/67 on postal services, while maintaining universal service and ensuring its economic viability, by providing for the gradual liberalization of the postal services market and taking into account the consequences for all those affected, including employees and customers. To this end, the Commission commissioned studies on the costs of universal service, the impact of liberalization on cross-border mail and direct mail, the consequences of reducing weight and price limits in the exclusive sector, and the impact of the subsequent phases of liberalization of postal services other than delivery. An overall evaluation of the results of the studies was also to be carried out. We are asking ourselves, and of course the Commissioner too – Mr Bolkestein is not here, but Mr Monti, with his broad expertise, can certainly comment on this: shouldn't these studies also examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios on each, I repeat, each, Member State of the European Union? Postal services are very different in Greece from those in Great Britain, and very different in the Netherlands from those in Belgium. After liberalisation, how will the universal postal service be adequately financed and organised in a country such as my own, Greece, which has the particular geographical feature of having many small but inhabited islands? How will an operator in my country, which is obliged to provide a universal service, survive if approximately 25% of cross-border postal services are liberalised, when in other countries this figure is less than 5%? What is the response to the relocation of the national postal service abroad? You heard what Mr McCartin just said about this. Since this is highly likely due to technological developments that make this shift easier and thus more profitable, further gradual and controlled liberalization must be decided upon, with simultaneous definition of weight and price categories. But what should these look like? Will we be so naive as to allow the companies, who then act like ""free shooters,"" to pick out the most lucrative items and circumvent the weight limits without any problem, since the contents of the mail cannot be verified anyway? In any case, we call on the Commission to lay bare its cards and present its proposals, while examining the planned overall development of this matter from all sides and for all Member States. Of course, liberalization is not an end in itself, but merely a means to improve services. Mr. President, Commissioner, dear colleagues! The envisaged liberalization of traditional national postal services inevitably raises the question of what the postal services will consider their core business in the future—in other words, what the postal services will still do themselves, what they will do together within the international network, and what they will no longer do. This question must be answered against the background of the fact that the sole monopoly has already been de facto eroded by various courier services and technological developments such as fax and email. On the other hand, employment is the central focus of postal services' liberalization."	de
By granting de facto preference to products from settlements in occupied territories during the validity of these trade agreements, the EU is violating two fundamental principles of international law: the rules on the unilateral integration of occupied territories, and the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. Since respect by the EU and the world for these two international principles is the basis of the peace process that has been initiated, such violations have the effect of undermining the foundations of the peace process itself. The EU must now choose between basing its relations with Israel and Palestine on the norms of international law, and thus strengthening the peace process, or ignoring international law altogether. The choice should be simple. International law prescribes that we establish trade relations only with countries and regions that it recognizes, and not with territories whose membership is disputed. EU Member States and Israel must respect the rules contained in the trade agreement on strict control of the origin of products, and customs duties must be returned. It is up to the Commission to ensure this. Commissioner Vitorino's intervention gives us some hope in this regard. The Middle East peace process must be given a chance. And this chance can only be based on international law. The EU has a responsibility to contribute to this. Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, I would first like to thank all the Members who have made a rich and valuable contribution to this debate at a time when a highly politically sensitive issue has been addressed. If the Commission can draw a lesson from this debate, I would say that we could conclude that, broadly speaking, Parliament is sticking to a cautious but clear strategy, which the Commission will also adopt to address this issue. The Commission is aware of the political sensitivity of this issue and has no doubt at any time that progress in finding concrete solutions for the practical implementation of this trade agreement is closely linked to developments in the Middle East peace process. In fact, the political importance attached to the peace process by the European Union is echoed in Parliament and the Commission, as several Members have pointed out, and this interest stems from the recent visit to this region by President Nicole Fontaine and President Romano Prodi last week. We are therefore well aware that we are living through a particularly delicate moment in the peace process, which must not be disrupted by positions resulting from a blind application of legal rules, since the application of the law requires an attempt to find a solution acceptable to all parties. And in truth, the Commission has adopted a position in this area aimed at securing the support and convergence of all parties involved in this peace process.	fr
I would like to emphasize to Mr Schulz that we do not table amendments as individuals or out of personal considerations, but always within the framework of a general political interest. If we wanted to draw up a list of those under investigation, or to search for such individuals, we could also find them among the rapporteurs, including the author of the report on this convention. I therefore believe Mr Schulz could have spared himself his offensive remarks. As I have already said, numerous amendments have been incorporated concerning the right of defense—I am thinking here of the obligation for the investigating judge to submit a request—and the fact that joint investigation teams may not include officials who are also judges. In principle, Parliament wanted the convention to apply exclusively to criminal law; the curtailment of fundamental rights and freedoms provided for in the convention must therefore necessarily be limited to criminal law. We need firm rules. It is, of course, true that the Council did not act consistently, that it changed its mind during the procedure, and that it is not present today. On the other hand, I would like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for being present in this Chamber during the debate. We therefore need secure rules to ensure that fair trials are conducted in the Union – without being overwhelmed by surveillance measures, without the unlawful use of videoconferencing; so that there will never again be trials in the Union in which judges play politics instead of dispensing justice; so that the truly guilty parties are punished, not innocent people who are inconvenient to anyone. Mr President, the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is about to be adopted by the Council. Most people say it is about time. Following the Action Plan to Combat Organized Crime, adopted by the Council in April 1997, work on the draft MLA Convention should be completed before the end of 1997. However, it will be some time before it actually enters into force, given that ratification by the Member States is required. Even under the new rules of the Amsterdam Treaty, which stipulate that the Convention will enter into force only after at least half of the Member States have accepted it, I would nevertheless urge the Member States to do everything in their power to ratify it as soon as possible. Unfortunately, past experience with the ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters has been disappointing. This Convention does not seek to create a new or different system of mutual legal assistance. Rather, it aims to build on tried and tested mechanisms that have existed for a very long time, such as those provided for by the 1959 European Mutual Assistance Convention and the Benelux Treaty. The draft prepared by the Council contains provisions on a wide range of matters that have been discussed by various Members. It is a notable achievement of the Convention that requested Member States must, wherever possible, adhere to the formalities and procedures referred to by the requesting Member State. This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using judicial evidence.	de
We cannot continue to allow all our political possibilities to be destroyed. Income from non-economic activities cannot continue to increase ever more rapidly. Since Tobin developed his idea, it has emerged that in Germany, income from financial capital has increased from 7.6% of all income to almost double that figure today. We cannot continue to see the poorest countries on this planet being the hardest hit by speculation affecting short-term currency fluctuations. Nor do I think it is unfeasible. Why should it not be possible to reach an agreement between the G7 states, the other EU states, China, Singapore, and Switzerland on the introduction of the Tobin tax? There must be a common economic interest. Why could we not manage - the distinction can be made - to subject to this tax transactions aimed at the immediate exchange of currencies, all so-called spot transactions, forward and option transactions on currencies? Why could we not set the amount of this tax in such a way as not to threaten economically indispensable long-term investments, but to ultimately make short-term and speculative investments unattractive? Many difficult questions will undoubtedly arise, but the only major problem I perceive is political will and this Sankt Florian principle, also applicable today, which consists of shifting responsibility from one place to another. Madam President, as Mr. Karas said a few minutes ago, we are not asking for more bureaucracy. We are looking for solutions. There is no doubt that more clarity is needed on the capital markets: that is the idea. The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to this very obscure issue. The more we move towards trade liberalization, the more rules we need. This is what Commissioner Lamy said at the opening of the Millennium Round in Seattle. He acknowledged that the combined effect of the single market and the single currency that characterize the process of building the European Union is closely linked to an enormous volume of new regulations. Now that capital can immediately cross national borders without any difficulty, it is clear that the same approach will be strictly necessary, especially since the amounts engaged daily in speculative transactions are enormous. We, citizens of the world, cannot accept the current level of speculation. To continue would be economic suicide. My dear colleagues, Commissioner, we often hear that Europe has succeeded in ensuring financial stability, which is true if we limit ourselves to the public sector. But if we include the private sector, we see that this famous financial stability has not only not been achieved, but that we are likely sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment. Private sector over-indebtedness and the corresponding excessive surge in share prices – the two major indicators of financial market stability – have long been in the red, as the Commission's own report on the economic situation in Europe demonstrates in a way that is beyond dispute.	fr
We believe that one factor that will influence the Commission's role in the near future is a certain revival of European political initiative on the part of the Member States' governments, following the failure of the Santer Commission. We consider this a very positive aspect, as it will enable the national parliaments, on which governments depend, to continue to insist on the indispensability of their democratic mandate in the construction of Europe. It is a fact that the European Parliament still fails to win the trust or even the interest of national public opinion, which stubbornly refuses to think in European terms, as demonstrated by the high abstention rate recorded in the recent elections. The aim, therefore, is to strengthen the mechanisms used for cooperation between the governments of the Member States by making them more coherent, transparent, and democratic. We welcome Romano Prodi's efforts to improve the Commission's public image and the need for it to reach an understanding with the European Parliament and the Council. However, we believe that the priority should be to reform the mechanisms of intergovernmental cooperation, particularly by creating a Council of Ministers for Europe, whose members would assume responsibility, among themselves and in consultation with the other European institutions, for ensuring that the political decisions of the European Councils are translated into concrete action. Corrie Report (A5-0032/2000) Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1999 was marked by growing concern about the continued existence of the cooperation model emerging from the Lomé Conventions. As early as 1994, in an initial resolution, to which our colleague Dominique Souchet played a key role, the Joint Assembly expressed concern about the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which had rejected the fundamental principle of Community preference, essential to such cooperation. These fears have been confirmed over the last two years. The most striking example is the banana dispute. Despite their unstable economies, developing countries are expected to adapt to trade liberalization. While Mr Corrie's report criticizes this situation and reaffirms the Joint Assembly's commitment to the Lomé model, it fails to sufficiently highlight a second problem, which is also fundamentally rooted in the misguided free trade policy: the incoherence of the regional trade agreements concluded by the European Union. The best example is the cooperation agreement with South Africa. The Council approved this agreement, negotiated by the Commission, even though the nevertheless important agricultural chapter had not yet been finally settled. As our colleague Paul-Marie Coûteaux aptly noted in his remarks yesterday and in his amendments, one must ask what political logic such a blank cheque might represent. We are very concerned about this, all the more so as a similar agreement with Mexico appears to be on the horizon. The rapporteur's call for the European Development Fund to be incorporated into the Community budget is also unacceptable. We want to preserve the clear commitment and responsibility of each Member State, as the intergovernmental nature allows. Unfortunately, we have seen too many examples of joint aid being diverted from its intended purpose, for which no one feels responsible, and we want to avoid such a disastrous system in the EDF.	de
"(Parliament adopted the motion for a resolution) Report (A5-0078/1999) by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the 28th Commission report on competition policy 1998 (SEC(1999)0743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)) (Parliament adopted the motion for a resolution.)

Report (A5-0073/1999) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission report on the application of its Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 introducing Community rules on Aid to the iron and steel industry (Steel Aid Code) in 1998 (COM(1999)94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)) (Parliament adopted the motion for a resolution.) Explanations of vote - Own resources system . (FR) The European Union is, as we know, financed from four sources of revenue. The European budget is fed by value added tax (VAT) and the share of GDP, particularly since the abolition of Community preference and the proliferation of free-trade areas led to the abolition of customs duties and the Community agricultural levy, which had already been curtailed by the GSP. Since then, the collection and fairness of Community own resources have been seriously compromised by VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP as the basis for taxing the fourth resource. Therefore, Europe, with its federal pretensions, is financing itself more than ever like a banal intergovernmental organization—which, indeed, it is, but does not want to be. This is quite clear from the regulation before us. Concerns are expressed about the ""accounting of own resources,"" their ""provision,"" and the ""control"" of the amounts made available to the Commission. Moreover, the newly created advisory committee consists of representatives of the contributing Member States. This is a far cry from the excesses already existing with ""Community criminal law,"" the ""Community Public Prosecutor General,"" or the Community police force with OLAF. There is still no European federal tax. However, the Europe of 25 will demand a European income tax, unless it prefers a profit tax, or the 2025 budget is financed from CO2 taxation. Koch Report (A5-0105/1999). (FR) I am very pleased with this report on improved harmonisation of the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods. Over recent years, the national and international transport of dangerous goods has increased considerably, with the associated risk of accidents rising sharply. In many cases, these accidents were due to insufficient knowledge of the risks associated with such transport. It therefore became necessary, as part of the creation of the internal market, to adopt measures to improve risk prevention. Directive 96/35/EC responded to this need. Undertakings whose activities include the transport of dangerous goods or the loading or unloading associated with such transport were rightly required to be subject to risk prevention rules applicable to transport by road, rail or inland waterway. To facilitate the implementation of this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of appropriately trained safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods."	de
"An appeal to the majority of the Austrian people who did not vote for Haider, who voted for clearly democratic options, committed to Europe—and I must point out that if Mr. Schüssel was Finance Minister, Chancellor Vranitzky also lent a hand in Austria's integration process. One cannot be so politically sectarian. We achieved Austria's entry into the Community together. It was the work of everyone, not just one group. Therefore, Madam President, I believe we have the right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reconsider, because the kind of plague we have already suffered in Europe can not only harm Austria but can, if necessary, spread, and I speak with the memory of history. Therefore, I would like to know if the EPP, apart from its defense of Mr. Schüssel, who will guarantee us everything, as Chamberlain and Daladier did in Munich in 1938, plans to take action against the Austrian People's Party if it goes ahead with this delusional project. Thirdly, if we do not rise up against this unnatural alliance, I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the main objective of the European Union, which is enlargement, can be considered over because, if you were Czechs or Slovenians or Hungarians, what would you say if you had a neighbor who treated you on a racial basis and did not want you to join? Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I believe this is a great day for the beginning of political Europe. We support the Council and believe that we are within our rights and under our obligation to address the Austrian people so that they seriously reconsider this absolutely delusional option. (Applause from the PSE Group) Madam President, my group welcomes this debate because we find ourselves at a decisive moment. This is the first time in the history of the modern European project that we are on the verge of witnessing the integration of a far-right party. This is deeply disturbing. The FPÖ argues that if we read its documentation and its programme, we will find many things we could share. That may be so, but today I want to record in the Minutes the long and difficult experience we Liberal Democrats had with the Austrian FPÖ in our Liberal International family. As early as 1986, we had reason to believe that Mr. Jörg Haider was not a man whose principles or attitudes were consistent with decency and modern liberalism. In November 1991, after a long internal debate within the Liberal International and numerous visits to Vienna to discuss the issues, we suspended the FPÖ's membership, and in July 1993, we expelled it. We expelled him then and continue to oppose what Mr. Haider stands for. Let me share with you what we learned from that long experience. Many within our ranks said, ""Read the text,"" but many more within our ranks said, ""Read between the lines."""	es
Madam President, in my dual capacity as a member of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group and as a Basque Nationalist Party MEP, I would first like to express our firm condemnation of the cowardly attack that claimed the lives of two people: Ertzaina Jorge Díez Elorza and the Basque MP and former vice-president Fernando Buesa. Second, we extend our heartfelt condolences, solidarity, and compassion to their families, their socialist comrades, the Basque Parliament, and the Basque Autonomous Police for this loss. Third, we denounce the gravity of an attack that not only ignores respect for dignity and human rights, but also disregards the will of the people by targeting an elected representative. Fourth, we express our disgust at the direct aim of this double murder to undermine the process of political normalization aimed at achieving peace in the Basque Country. Fifth, we appeal to the Spanish and French governments and political leaders, urging them once again to show the same sense of proportion shown in the United Kingdom and Ireland in order to find a solution to the current Basque political conflict through measures other than police measures, which in themselves will not bring about the pacification we all desire. Sixth and finally, we declare that ETA's terrorism and violence must end and that it must cease stifling the will of Basque citizens, who must be able to decide their future freely and without coercion. Just three months ago, I, like many of my colleagues, congratulated the Irish and British people in this Chamber on their success in finding a solution to the Northern Ireland conflict. Over the past 30 years, too many people have been injured and murdered in Northern Ireland—too many families have been destroyed. As for the current conflict in the Basque Country, unfortunately, the exact opposite has happened in Spain and France. We at Euskal Herritarrok firmly believe that the current struggle can only be definitively ended through open dialogue and transparent negotiations without a rigid agenda. In the nineteen months prior to January 20th, there was only one murder in the Kingdom of Spain: the assassination of ETA member Luis Geresta, who died in March 1999. Despite this attack and the arrests by the Spanish and French police, including of ETA members who were negotiating with the Spanish government, ETA maintained its unilateral ceasefire. Then, in November of last year, before the ceasefire ended, Spanish government spokesperson Piqué declared that his government had done everything possible to date and would continue to do everything possible to thwart the current efforts to find a political solution for the Basque Country. We at Euskal Herritarrok have often had to mourn the loss of human life. Together with the Basque people, we share the suffering of our people. We are in favor of dialogue, and we are ready to cooperate with all those seeking a democratic solution for the Basque Country. Twenty years have passed since the Northern Ireland question was first raised in this Parliament.	de
With these comprehensive documents, aren't we reinventing the Gosplan, Mr. President? One might ask, especially when reading the French contribution, which goes too far in its dirigisme by proposing that a whole series of national policies be coordinated in Brussels, for example in the areas of employment, social protection, or SMEs, and by accompanying them with a vast array of coded indicators whose monitoring would have to be organized. Such centralized control would result in new violations of subsidiarity, new detailed standardizations, new compulsory coordination imposed on countries in different situations—in short, new elements of rigidity added to the rigidity of the single currency. The Lisbon Council should, in our view, set itself the goal of eliminating this rigidity, promoting flexibility and adaptation, and exchanging positive national experiences to stimulate the creativity that will only flourish thanks to the freedom of choice of people. Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, distinguished colleagues, in the speeches we have heard, a sublime goal has been mentioned, specifically, the goal of making us, as Europeans, competitive with the United States, becoming equal partners with the United States. This should actually be possible if we consider our gross domestic product. However, if, on the other hand, we consider, for example, in the area of people—when it comes to finding a new IMF President—how Europeans behave in this regard vis-à-vis Americans, then we are undoubtedly still very far from this equal partnership. Now, we must ask ourselves why this is so. There are certainly sectors in the economic sphere—even in the media—where we hold leading positions. I am referring, for example, to mobile phones. Here in the Plenary Hall, we have quite rightly banned them, for they are instruments of torture. But at the same time, in some areas they also constitute a substantial aid in life, as they create jobs. In this area, we Europeans are ahead of the curve. Why? We are ahead because we managed to arrive early at a common European regulation in this field, a common European standard that has now become a global standard. This means that if we Europeans make the effort in time, we will also be competitive in this area of new technologies. Where do Europe's deficits really lie? I believe, Mr. President of the Council, that we cannot eliminate the deficits by establishing more observatories, as is currently planned. I believe these observatories generate a few jobs for civil servants, but they do not create jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises. In Europe, we have a deficit in the area of training. This indicates that in the area of new media, we have to import from countries outside Europe. Europe lacks, as has already been said, entrepreneurship, an entrepreneurial spirit.	es
UCITS have been a great success in the European Union: they are a safe product and traded across borders. But it is time to update the legislation that regulates them and that is where Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job. I have to say, however, that I am not enthusiastic about the considerable changes that have been made to the Schmidt report in Parliament. I urge the House to take a balanced and sensible approach to the issue at hand. The radical measure taken by this report is to allow UCITS to use OTC derivatives. I ask everyone here to consider the products that UCITS will use; we are not talking about using derivatives for speculative purposes, but about using them to reduce risks and increase returns on the savings of ordinary European citizens. We must congratulate Mr Schmidt on getting Parliament's support for OTC derivatives. We must not be afraid to move forward and react to changes in the market. We must continue our efforts so that UCITS offer consumers a balanced and protected product; The report protects consumers very adequately. However, some of the amendments excessively restrict the use of OTC derivatives. I believe that this type of derivatives will be a supplement to the portfolio of investment funds, and this can only benefit individual European citizens who will obtain high returns on their savings. I pay tribute to Mr Schmidt. Many thanks, Mr Kuckelkorn. Ladies and gentlemen, I can now give you some news on the issue of the screen and the window. If we remove this screen, we will find behind it a temporary wall that cannot be removed now. We will therefore have to postpone this experiment until the next plenary session. However, I will ensure that a trial is carried out at that time to see what effect it has. Mr President, since it came into force on 1 October 1989, the UCITS Directive has been a huge success, mainly because of the high level of investor protection it guarantees. The investment fund sector has used the Directive and the positive image of UCITS among investors to increase its activities in the European Union fivefold. Cross-border marketing of investments within the European Union has grown significantly and the Directive itself has become a model piece of legislation worldwide. However, ten years on, given the development of markets and the offer of new and increasingly sophisticated financial products, it is clear that it is now a little out of date. The Commission proposals being discussed in this Chamber provide the facelift it needs. I share some of the concerns expressed - particularly by Mr García-Margallo - but this facelift would be even more appropriate if funds that simply replicate a stock market index - and are therefore passively managed or, better still, not managed at all - and those that use an index as a benchmark for an actively managed fund were managed in the same way, if only to allow medium-sized companies that are listed on the stock exchange, even if they are not included in the stock market index, to gain better access to the capital market.	it
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament has watered down a Council position, whereas we generally - I believe - act the other way around. Taking back end-of-life vehicles free of charge, for example, and increasing the proportion of recycling would expand the relevant economic activities and thus create new jobs. In the interests of consumers, the environment, and the new jobs created in the recycling industry, the Council's common position, which is entirely acceptable in its current form, must therefore not be amended under any circumstances. Mr President, like many of those present, I consider this a good measure. It is a sensible measure that we all need. The technical problems have essentially been resolved. A few individual issues still need to be definitively clarified, but the majority of the technical problems have been resolved. We have come to the final question. In the debate at first reading, this question was raised only by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I, as the draftsman of that committee's opinion, put it to Parliament. It is quite simply: who pays? The Council proposed a sensible compromise in its common position, which states that manufacturers should bear a significant part of the costs, but not all of them, as Mr. Bowis erroneously stated. In fact, as the lawyers tell us, perhaps no more than 20% or one-fifth of the costs. Surely that is not too much. If you look at the British consumer, for example, who buys a Rover cited by Mr. Lange, or indeed any other car brand in the United Kingdom, and who has been paying inflated prices for these cars for years, far higher than comparable prices elsewhere in Europe, why should they pay? They have already paid. Why should these same people, as taxpayers or future car buyers, pay for the disposal of vehicles from which the manufacturer has made money? I cannot accept that. We have some amendments before us today that propose exactly that. I cannot accept that, and I will not vote for them. The responsibility for these vehicles lies with the manufacturer. The manufacturer must provide the appropriate infrastructure and bear a reasonable share of the disposal costs. The common position does not rule out the possibility of state involvement. The common position is a reasonable compromise. Some of the amendments tabled today are completely unreasonable in that they relieve car manufacturers of their responsibility for bearing even the smallest part of the costs of vehicle disposal. I cannot accept that, and I am therefore voting against these amendments on behalf of European taxpayers and consumers. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, there is agreement that we must think about how we in Europe properly deal with old cars, but in this case the Council has not set an example of sensible European environmental policy. The way the German Council Presidency handled this issue was disgraceful. First, Mr. Trittin, the Environment Minister, did not coordinate sufficiently with his colleagues in the Cabinet, and then Chancellor Schröder, like a bull in a china shop, interfered in this process without any expertise.	de
If it exists, we have fostered it in this House over the past year. I have been here for 20 years and have found absolute trust between the Council, the Commission, and Parliament. We have had our problems and seen difficulties, but there has never been a situation in which the citizens of the European Union distrusted, doubted, or feared this bureaucratic Commission because it was mismanaging our affairs. This is a vast exaggeration of the existing difficulties. This Commission must not live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the previous Commission. While there were problems—and we must resolve them in anticipation of enlargement, for example—on some occasions we took the negative aspects too far. Mr. President, Commissioners, first of all, I cannot help thinking that this debate, as far as the speakers are concerned, is Dutch-English-Scandinavian. Perhaps that is a little unsettling. I hope, like many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is disappearing. It's not right for us to continue running around trying to put out fires. On the contrary, as Blak said, we must create a system with clear functions. First, we need a system of solid, enforceable rules. Codes of conduct and ethics committees aren't enough. There must be consistent rules that, among other things, specify what can be decentralized, what can be delegated to others, and what is independent. I find it a little alarming that in this debate we talk about independence without defining it and without specifying the right to decide. Therefore, the EU needs a basic system of administrative rules for its institutions and for its relations with member states. This doesn't exist. We have pointed out the need for a Community Prosecutor's Office and Community criminal law, but we also need Community administrative law. We would make significant progress if the Commission approved the delegate's proposal for a code of conduct for good administrative practices as a mandatory rule. The Van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough. Secondly, we must clarify our own role in reviews. The Court of Auditors examines whether something complies with the rules, but it does not monitor its usefulness. It is the European Parliament that is responsible for making political assessments. We do not pursue criminals; that is OLAF's job. Tell me, for example, to which national parliament the documents in a case are sent. I would like to say, with the stubbornness of a drunk, that the regulation on the disclosure of documents will have to be much better than the draft that has been circulating on the internet; otherwise, we will get nowhere in this fight. Mr. President, I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteur for his report. I am happy to be able to address him now in Dutch, after Mr. Van den Berg did so. Otherwise, I might have felt a little guilty.	es
It would be very beneficial, not only for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but also for the reputation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, if they would respond to these attempts to establish dialogue. Question No. 31 by (H-0795/99): Subject: Regulation on good administration in the EU rejected by the Commission. According to press reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal by Mr. Jacob Söderman, the European Ombudsman, on the right of citizens to good administration in the EU. The Commission itself has accepted the idea of a regulation on this subject, but has not yet accepted the specific proposal made, limiting itself to issuing a series of additional instructions on improving the service. Is this information true? What is the reason for the Commission's actions, and how does it intend to explain the gap its actions create between words and deeds regarding the reform of EU administration? Does the Commission consider that what has happened is in line with the five-year program agreed in September by the European Parliament and the Commission? Is the Commission prepared to present a detailed proposal on the regulations relating to good administration so that Parliament can also comment on it? Mr. Patten, on behalf of the Commission, gives the floor. The press reports to which the Honourable Member refers are, in my opinion, misleading and inaccurate. In November 1999, the Commission adopted a code of good administrative behaviour at first reading for incorporation into its Rules of Procedure. The Commission is currently consulting its staff representatives on the document, a process that will be completed in the coming weeks. The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading. It should be noted that the new Commission immediately followed up on the European Ombudsman's decision of 28 July 1999 with its own-initiative consultation on the Code. The Commission would like to emphasize in particular that, in drafting the Code, it has taken into consideration all of the European Ombudsman's draft recommendations. The Code will be a document dealing exclusively with the relations of the Commission's administration with citizens. It will be adopted by a legally binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman's Office. In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties, the legislator responsible for establishing the Commission's Regulation is the Commission itself. However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of maintaining regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and ask him when these instructions are expected to finally come into force, given that they have been in place since 1997. The information appearing in the press was misleading.	es
Perhaps you will eventually understand that the European Union's cultural activities pose no danger, but rather an opportunity! Cultural collaboration—this is another point we have emphasized—truly creates an identity, much more so than any transport directive, however important it may be. Everyone agrees that culture must be promoted, which cannot be said of all political decisions. That being the case, I ask the Council what it is afraid of. Madam President, who, like me, has the honor of chairing the Committee on Culture, can only share what my various colleagues have said and can only congratulate the rapporteur and Commissioner Reding, as well as, as everyone has said, those who have worked and those who, even during conciliation, have had moments of difficulty and have fought against the Council. I have seen that the principle of a culture that is necessary at the organizational level has been strongly affirmed, but with little ability to meet all the requests that the European States will make. I would like to emphasize that I am not satisfied that, in the end, a review clause was not approved. There is, however, the availability and foresight of Mrs. Reding, who has personally committed to addressing the issue again and conducting a comprehensive assessment in a few years and, consequently, determining a new situation. The cultural programs—KALEIDOSCOPE, ARIADNA, RAFAEL—that were established in recent years are being replaced by a single program, Culture 2000, in which—I must emphasize this emphatically—the rapporteur stigmatizes a position that should make the European Parliament reflect—as someone said this afternoon—but which always emphasizes the great importance of being part of a broad community where the interpretation of culture is a factor of democracy. I believe that these are not rhetorical words, but a new element of a modern liberalism that unites European states and constitutes the turning point of the European Parliament and the Commission. We are in line with this line of thinking, and the result we are presenting this afternoon, despite the meager funding, I believe serves to significantly relaunch this strategy and this opportunity for Europe, which ultimately determines an economic factor and a development factor, and therefore culture, the institutional and organizational element of a large community as a prerequisite for economic development, and not the opposite, as perhaps Europe, following a cultural custom, was accustomed to believing years ago. There is a prevalence of the human being, a prevalence of culture, and this culture can determine economic development. We must consider this result, congratulate ourselves on it, and demonstrate a clear openness to a useful strategy. Madam President, allow me first of all to express my gratitude to Mr. Graça Moura for having been able to weave this way into the somewhat complicated fabric that has constituted this tapestry of conciliation. I consider it very appropriate that at the beginning of the conciliation procedure for Culture 2000, we have been able to count on a poet to guide us in our work. Once again, because these reconciliations are not entirely easy, we must thank Vice President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the intricate task of ensuring that cultural funds are allocated to our Community and that they are used appropriately.	es
We can discuss this a little later. But I see that the reality corresponds exactly to what I am saying, namely that prices have fallen in areas where competition prevails, while they have risen where the postal service remained a monopoly. This almost always happens. That is why I am asking today that the Commission take the necessary initiatives and ensure that competition really does take place in the postal sector. Mr Markov, you will have a few minutes in five or six minutes. I would be grateful if you would not interrupt your colleagues. Mr President, there is a mystery. What happened to the postal services directive that was adopted on 15 December 1997? Between then and today, the silence from the Commission has been deafening. I am sorry that it is Commissioner Monti who is here today. I appreciate him very much. He is one of the most diligent and hard-working Commissioners. I regret that I cannot say the same for some of his colleagues. During that period, the Postal Services Directive has shown no real progress. Commissioner Monti said that this was partly due to the organization and the new allocation of tasks. All of this has only happened recently. For over a year, the old Commission could have worked on this. We really made very little progress. However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like to ask him to tell Commissioner Bolkestein what the Postal Services Directive was about. It was about progressive liberalization, about a guaranteed universal service at a reasonable price, about keeping direct mail and cross-border mail in the reserved sector. These issues were fundamental to the report concerned and they should be fundamental to any future directive. The postal service is not just for the Christmas period. It is useful for life. In the part of Scotland where I come from, it is much more than just a postal service. It serves to maintain the link between communities. The postal service is also the bus service. The postal service is also the social service. The postal service is also the doctor. If we allow the complete privatization of postal services, we will lose all of that, and many of our local communities will lose their tourism—we voted on that earlier. We will cut them off from the world. Postal services are important. That message must be conveyed from this House today. The Commission must listen to it. Mr. President, we support the liberalization of postal services in the European Union. This liberalization must, first and foremost, mean that customers will be better served. That is the direction, that must be the ultimate objective. Liberalization began because there were doubts about the structure of postal services, about the value of a monopoly. Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where customer demand can change very quickly and where the market situation can also change very quickly, because, for example, electronic information media are used much more extensively?	fr
"The EU/ACP agreements make a mockery of democratic principles and the fight against corruption, sparing those responsible: when will there be sanctions and a control of Total-Elf, which fuels the supporters of the civil war in Congo? When will there be a control of Shell? Although the market is presented as the only rule that should govern EU/ACP relations, the European Union also provides for police management of immigration, as implied by Article 13, which justifies the policy of European states against undocumented immigrants. We do not accept this agreement because it deprives people of the means to create companies that are independent of European multinationals and banks. Mr President, I would like to commend the sincere commitment of MEPs - including some of my Labour colleagues - in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, and to commend their efforts to secure a new Lomé agreement, which will benefit some of the poorest countries in the world. Few people in my constituency are probably aware that the EU is the world's biggest donor of international aid. Others may have bigger missiles, but the EU can draw on bigger funds. That is something the EU can be proud of, and perhaps something we should highlight more often. The successes of the Labour government in Britain are also not insignificant. Clare Short, a member of the current British Parliament, holds one of the world's few international development ministers, and in that capacity she can make her voice heard in government. Meanwhile, Gordon Brown MP has led international efforts to relieve the huge debt burden of the Third World and ensured that Labour's campaign to reduce poverty does not stop at the Channel. Labour's aim to reduce poverty remains the same wherever it is pursued, whether it is guaranteeing a living wage in Manchester or fighting for debt relief in Durban. Of course, much remains to be done. The new great challenge we face is to relaunch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed in Seattle last December. It must be a ""development round"", in which developing countries, excluded from previous rounds, can participate fully. In fact, the best way to reduce poverty in the world is to promote the autonomy of developing countries; more than aid, they need trade; they want a hand, but not our alms. The best way to help them is to open world markets to allow them to sell their products; in this way, the power of globalization can be used for good, to the benefit of the poor and not just the rich, to the benefit of the many and not just the few. With the New Deal in Newcastle or fair trade in Freetown, the goal of the Labour Party remains unchanged: opportunity for all. Swoboda report (A5-0031/2000) The Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and FYROM, in the form of a mixed agreement pursuant to Article 310 of the EU Treaty, can contribute to restoring stability and development in this Balkan republic and therefore financial support granted through the PHARE programme could be decisive."	it
"The common will to overcome this terrible and still-relevant history of the 20th century, when all humanistic ideals were destroyed in the heart of Europe, is the true significance of the European Union. And if somewhere in Europe a government enters into a coalition with neo-fascists, it is not merely a question of national sovereignty. For our Union is not a loose association of nation states that come to terms with one another to improve their position. It is a community of shared destiny in which, when fundamental issues are at stake, when fundamental values are threatened, all democrats must seek solutions together to prevent the mistakes of the past from being repeated. We should learn the lessons of the past. In the 1930s, when Adolf Hitler was democratically elected, admittedly by a minority, many believed that this wasn't so bad after all. And, Mr. Poettering, in my country, some people from the right-wing camp, but certainly representatives of other currents as well, thought: ""Better Hitler than the Popular Front."" You prioritized petty party squabbling instead of focusing on the essentials—and it led to disaster. We must react quickly, decisively, and jointly. I would have liked to have seen you speak with the Austrian President, Mr. Poettering, who is known to be deeply embarrassed by this dirty coalition government. So we must react quickly and decisively. Of course, the treaty offers protection if the situation becomes unbearable; I almost said ""irreparable."" History has taught us that fascists use the hot-and-cold tactic: first, they heat up—populist and xenophobic rhetoric—then they cool down—they become presentable, are represented in institutions that they gradually infiltrate and undermine, and then one day they strike. And then it's too late. Now, our treaty provides safeguards for when it's too late. But we're not there yet: today, we must prevent it from getting that far. So we need a political solution. I therefore support the Council's proposals and, at the same time, regret the somewhat cautious and timid behavior of the Commission, which should really be constantly resolute and vigilant, because the fascists are counting on the weaknesses of democracy, they are gambling on time to wear us down, hoping to ultimately prevail. We must therefore react quickly. If we do not resolutely support the Council today, history will judge us and speak of a ""political Munich."" Madam President, I am pleased that the will of the overwhelming majority of the population is being respected in Austria and that, in my view, democracy has achieved a very significant victory with this government formation. One thing must be made quite clear: to a Europe that develops into a kind of Big Brother, monitoring the left-wing political correctness of the member states in a Stalinist manner and using Stalinist methods, to such a Europe we say: no, thank you. European democracy and Austrian democracy need not be lectured by anyone, especially not by the Belgian government, which includes corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and which has appointed the leader of such a corrupt party, convicted by a court, as a member of the European Commission."	de
Essentially - through a legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of every financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems of departmental expenditure so that Directorates-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions that may affect the EU budget. Furthermore, to have more guarantees than the current system provides, the new decentralised control system will have to be accompanied by an internal audit service - the second key, as Mr Bösch called it - in line with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts. This service will start operating on 1 May this year, will be led by a highly qualified auditor, and its independence must and will be guaranteed through new provisions to be added to the Financial Regulation. The new service will be accountable to me, and will be supported by an audit committee chaired by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, whom I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening. As Commissioner for Budgets, she is already responsible for relations with the Court of Auditors. This audit committee will ensure that internal audits are then followed up effectively and rigorously. I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems in no way means making them less stringent. The proposed changes will make the systems more effective both in terms of the information they receive and in terms of the thoughtful and accountable results they provide. I can also give the House explicit assurance that we will not adopt what is sometimes called a 'big bang approach'. The financial controls that have been in place so far over each body's spending will only be abandoned once the new system of internal control over each department's spending has proven to be fully adequate. I am a little surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to make any fundamental criticism of the current centralised character of financial control, contrary to both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts. The Committee of Independent Experts has made it very clear that the current centralised system needs to be abolished, and has also been explicit about the need to separate internal audits from financial control. I also do not believe that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution fully reflects the opinion expressed by the Court of Auditors in 1997. Of course, the Court may, after careful consideration, express its opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation, but it is useful to recall the comments made in the Chamber last month by President Karlsson. He said that the Commission's internal control is not sufficiently effective to prevent incorrect functioning. For example, the Financial Controller had given prior approval to most of the cases of mismanagement and irregularities recently discovered. Furthermore, the internal audit function is carried out, without adequate coordination, by various bodies, such as the Financial Controller himself, the General Inspectorate and some units of the Directorates-General. Originally, the centralized system of prior approval was certainly adequate to ensure adequate control, but over the years it has instead ended up reducing the degree of responsibility of officials for decisions.	it
"We look forward with interest and confidence to a concerted strategy for the modernization of social security systems in Europe, which, however, must not be separated from a parallel process of convergence: this means modernization, but also cohesion, as the rapporteur, with whom we agree, has emphasized in his report. In many policy areas, this latter path has been initiated, albeit with difficulty, but in many others it still needs to be followed before Europe, even if the principle of subsidiarity is respected, can truly become a common home not only for the citizens of the Member States but also for the people of the candidate countries. European social security systems have, moreover, always played a positive role in the social and democratic development of every people; and since these systems must continue to act as a pillar of development today, in the face of economic developments, the world of work, and the needs of society, they must naturally be modernized. Nevertheless, we would like to emphasize three main aspects: First, there must be a close and directly proportional link between economic policy, employment policy, and social security policy. Second, there is the issue of the management of social security systems and their providers. In fact, increasingly comprehensive and effective measures are being taken in the area of additional and supplementary social security. However, we believe that this must not under any circumstances lead to a weakening of the role of the public authorities, both because of the universality and the desirable quality of basic social security benefits. This is fundamentally a principle of justice that applies to health care, pension systems, and also to social assistance, where the public authorities cannot escape strategic coordination, albeit in a new form. The third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity, on which the Union is founded. To date, there is no common strategy for social protection and social security, and the current systems are essentially based on action and solidarity within the Member States. When modernizing these systems, the differences between individual states—whether member states or accession states—in the areas of the economy, employment, and social protection must not be ignored. Modernization, which is closely linked to a process of convergence, albeit one based on different preconditions, must therefore be able to strive for and promote developments that increase, rather than reduce, the level of social protection. This is, moreover, a matter of culture, progress, and the common dignity of the current and future enlarged European Union. The common values of the Member States of the European Union are based on democracy, human rights and freedom, as well as a social market economy. This spirit must be expressed in solidarity with the vulnerable groups in our society and the outside world. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, Member States design their own social security systems. However, all citizens of the European Union should be able to enjoy a minimum level of social security, regardless of their country of residence. The report calls for ""effective and ambitious fiscal coordination"" without further defining what this means. In our view, such a statement would constitute too great an intervention in national tax policy and therefore cannot receive our support."	de
"Madam Member, according to the Rules of Procedure, this is not possible. You must speak outside the Chamber. Questions to Commissioner Barnier I am announcing Question No 44, from the Honourable Member (H-0020/00): Subject: Partnership and the Third CSF for Greece The new Regulation 1260/1999/EC on the Structural Funds places emphasis, in contrast to the previous regulation, on strengthening partnership and provides for the participation of regional and local authorities and other competent public authorities, the economic and social partners and any body competent in this field, both in the preparation and financing, monitoring and evaluation of interventions. However, with regard to the new Greek CSF, representatives of the local authorities have repeatedly complained that the procedures have remained similar to the previous ones and are not at all essential as regards the role of the ""partners"". Has the Greek State changed the procedures in order to broaden the composition of the social relationship, essentially with regard to local authorities and other representative bodies? What is the increased role of local authorities in the preparation and management of the third CSF, and what measures does the Commission intend to take to ensure that the ""partners"" are more closely involved in all the procedures of the new CSF? Allow me to extend by one sentence the reply that Margot Wallström has just given to President David Martin, to tell him that, as it is a joint letter from two of our predecessors, as the successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I believe that this letter retains its validity and that I undertake, in common agreement with Margot Wallström, to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the Structural Funds with the Union's environmental directives and policies. It is also a former Minister for the Environment who is answering you, Mr Martin. I would now like to turn briefly to Mr Alavanos, who I hope will forgive this incursion into another subject, to tell him, in response to his question, that the Commission has monitored and will monitor, in the context of the preparation of the new programming period, the application of the principle of partnership. The association of regional and local authorities with Community action is, I would remind you, although you know it, an essential element of the new Structural Funds regulation after Berlin. More specifically, with regard to the application of this partnership principle in the context of the next Community support framework for Greece, the Commission has been able to ascertain that the public authorities have contributed significantly to the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the period 2000-2006. Mr Alavanos knows this, I have been there twice in rather tragic circumstances, after the tragedy of the earthquake; during these visits I was able to discuss with the Greek government authorities and recall the need to give adequate consideration to the objective and the need for partnership. As regards, Mr Alavanos, the subsequent stages, namely the preparation of national and regional programmes, it is not enough to incorporate the objective at national and theoretical level, it must be done in practice in the programmes implementing the CSFs at national, regional and local level. As regards the monitoring and management of the programmes, I have not yet received the national provisions proposed by the Greek Government pursuant to Article 8 of the new Regulation."	it
Since approximately 80% of the European population lives in urban areas, cities are at the heart of Europe's economic, social, and cultural development. At the same time, the social and economic problems of European society are much more evident in cities. Many European cities are confronted with an internal territorial divide, which manifests itself in the fact that, within the same city, districts characterized by high-added economic activities and high-income residents exist alongside others characterized by low incomes, high unemployment, mediocre and overcrowded housing, and heavy dependence on social assistance. The concentration of social and economic problems in certain urban areas requires targeted intervention that does justice to the complexity of the problems. Therefore, the European Parliament successfully called for the continuation of the URBAN Community Initiative (CI) as part of the reform of the Structural Funds. The success of URBAN in the 1994/1999 programming period is undeniable. Concrete successes have been achieved in the form of improvements in the quality of life in the eligible areas. This GI promoted the development of good practices in the economic, social, and environmental fields. One of its successes was the strengthening of the role of local authorities, non-governmental organizations, and regional authorities, as well as the promotion of new forms of partnership in urban regeneration. The new initiative will pursue these objectives in a more focused manner, with particular emphasis on promoting equal opportunities for men and women and the integration of socially excluded and disadvantaged groups. Its adoption is therefore to be welcomed. However, it should be noted that from a financial point of view, we have no cause for celebration, as the allocated resources fall far short of the challenges to be met. They have shrunk from €900 million for the period 1994/1999 to €700 million for 2000/2006, a reduction of 30%! This reduction has led to a reduction in the number of programs under the new URBAN initiative. The chosen ceiling of 50 programs is undoubtedly too low. It must be increased to take regional and local specificities into account without reducing the financial allocations to Member States. Given this concentration on a limited number of projects, the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative may play a decisive role in achieving a multiplier effect. The McCarthy report on the URBAN Community Initiative provides an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in the urban sphere. The situation in certain urban areas is alarming, as social deprivation manifests itself there in the form of unemployment, poverty, and crime. Drug trafficking, in particular, leads to insecurity and acquisitive crime. In the face of such social problems, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds remains questionable. Based on subsidiarity, we should actually say that the state, in the exercise of its sovereign powers, and local authorities are better placed to intervene appropriately in this regard: the state to ensure security, and local authorities to assist the needy. The intention to create a system for the exchange of best practices is to be welcomed, but the specific problems of individual urban areas are not always comparable. The URBAN Community Initiative is linked to the European Union's intention to communitize urban policy.	de
This is all the more serious because it fails to take into account the new situation created by the enlargement process to include regions such as Malta. We therefore propose extending the eligible regions to at least the NUTS III borders of Sicily – in relation to Malta – and to all the Adriatic regions – in relation to the Balkans. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my satisfaction that the outermost regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention under the INTERREG III initiative. This has opened up new opportunities for cooperation with the countries in their geographical area. However, it must be said that we could have expected better results, particularly in terms of access to the various strands. For a long time, and this is undoubtedly due to the persistence of colonial ways of thinking, our regions looked towards their European capital and ignored, even despised, their nearest neighbors. That phase is now clearly over. Our regions have become aware of their belonging to an environment to which they are bound not only for geographical reasons, but also for cultural reasons and by the history of their peoples. Hence the unequivocally expressed desire to become more firmly anchored in this environment. This new self-image concerns more than just identity. It is also based on a better understanding of our assets. The island of Réunion, for example, is located on an axis of exchange between the states of southern Africa and Southeast Asia. It cannot afford to distance itself from the regional groupings active in this area, as otherwise it would miss a historic opportunity. This is also true of our Caribbean region. Ultimately, we are convinced that our young people can find a way out of the discouraging and dramatic unemployment if we can export the know-how they have acquired with the help of European Structural Funds to neighboring countries. By using INTERREG funds, our regions can become true bridgeheads of the European Union in their respective geographical areas, thus giving it a global dimension. I am counting on the Commission, and especially on you, Commissioner, to provide these regions with the resources they need to take effective action. Mr President, Members of the Commission, while I wholeheartedly support the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation within the framework of INTERREG, I must express my concern that the proposal contains fewer opportunities of this kind for coastal regions than for other regions. I understand the Commission's concern that great distances can be detrimental to effective cooperation. Nevertheless, there are many coastal regions between which contacts have already been established. The numerous municipalities along the North Sea coast are an excellent example of this. INTERREG would certainly make it possible to strengthen this cooperation. For this reason, I would like to make some minor adjustments to the guidelines, thereby introducing a little more flexibility and taking into account the interests of maritime areas that are often caught between strands A and B. For example, the possibilities for cooperation between coastal regions and the creation of space for the increased development of practical and visible projects, particularly in the area of infrastructure, should be analysed.	de
There are also divergences between national legal systems and lengthy rogatory procedures, which sometimes even remain unanswered. Not even the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests, signed by the European Council in 1995, and the two associated protocols have changed this state of affairs: to enter into force, the Convention must be ratified by all 15 Member States, while to date - and five years have already passed - only four have done so. Such inaction risks undermining the credibility of the Union and has led Parliament to propose the establishment of European Prosecutor's Offices. The aim is in no way to create a transnational criminal and judicial system, but rather to provide the Union with the tools necessary to protect its financial interests, in full compliance with the subsidiarity principle. The report we are debating takes up this idea and calls on the European Commission to present legislative proposals to achieve this objective, taking on board the concerns expressed in the opinions of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. Drawing the consequences of the establishment of OLAF, the two recommendations we have formulated aim to ensure its efficiency and operational and legal transparency as well as the protection of individual rights. To this end, a legislative act is needed - the subject of the first recommendation - which covers the types of crimes damaging the financial interests of the Union and also sets out some guidelines of principle. In this regard, I support the amendment which sets 30 September as the deadline by which the Commission must present its proposal. The second recommendation concerns criminal procedure. The Commission - and here too I propose an amendment by 31 May 2000 - should present a legal act on the establishment of an independent body, institutionally linked to the Commission, which would exercise powers of coordination and control over the regularity of OLAF's investigative activity. The Supervisory Committee already in place can only control the independence of the Director of the Office. The proposed act should provide for an independent status for this new body and define its functions, limiting them to OLAF's internal investigations and the prosecution of those who damage the financial interests of the European Communities, as well as to relations with national authorities. Any influence on the administration of justice in the Member States is excluded. Supervision of the regularity of acts should be entrusted to the Court of Justice. We also hope that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will launch a debate on the creation of a European authority that can exercise criminal prosecution to protect the financial interests of the Union, possibly on the basis of the study known as Corpus Juris, carried out by renowned scholars and now widely recognised, as well as the feasibility studies published in the meantime. This project is also advocated in the second report of the so-called Committee of Wise Men. The Commission, Commissioners Barnier and Vitorino, and some Member States are also inclined to take up this idea. I therefore ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, approved by a large majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control.	it
"But in this regard, Mr President, the Commission and Parliament will need the Council to ensure that the creation of this European research area has the necessary financial resources. The framework programme will no longer be sufficient; it will need to be altered, by modifying its basic guidelines. This is a huge task, but we are counting on you. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office spoke of a political deficit. I believe that the proposals you will put forward in Lisbon, which should allow a synthesis of the famous broad economic policy guidelines, of the ""Employment"" guidelines, so as to derive guidelines for European growth and employment policy, are heading in the right direction. It is a tool for the decision-making process. Yet those proposals imply a number of institutional decisions whose weight can only be assessed in the medium term. It is proposed to strengthen the role of the European Council in the decision-making process. Our work in this regard is not without impact, and this impact must be weighed up in all the decisions we take in the debate on the reform of the General Affairs Council. Furthermore, behind this decision-making process at European level lies another battle to be fought: the one that each of us will have to wage in our own Member States, because there is no point in launching beautiful guidelines at political level if the budget debate in our countries does not take those guidelines into account. Each of us has the task of working on it. In the context of the strategy that you are proposing to us, with a ten-year objective, how can we not welcome the ambitious goal that you are setting out, namely to stop considering full employment in the European Union as a taboo and to equip ourselves with the necessary means for this purpose, with a growth objective set at 3%? And yet, beyond that, with regard to the objective of a knowledge economy, Claude Desama before me mentioned the role of public services in achieving this objective; For my part, I would like to emphasize a lifelong learning strategy. This requires concrete objectives, and we know that we will not achieve them without basing each proposal on a real social dialogue: something on which more needs to be done. Finally, a few words on social cohesion. I welcome the insistence with which you spoke about it, because we do not know what to do with a society that trades the progress of innovation for the abandonment of social cohesion. And we do not think that the fight against exclusion can be fragmented: it is a global project and the idea of target categories may perhaps constitute an intermediate stage, but certainly not the solution to our difficulties in terms of poverty and social exclusion. We know that we must commit ourselves to this battle, and we know that we can count on your determination. In Lisbon, we will give you our support in implementing new guidelines for the Union's economic policy. Mr President, like my colleagues, I welcome the very clear document presented today by the Portuguese Presidency."	it
As a specific comment, I would like to thank Mrs. Cederschiöld for clarifying in her document, among other things, the concept of so-called provisional copies. The WIPO Treaty has deliberately adopted no position on provisional copies. If these technical copies were included in the scope of protection, the exchange of information would become very expensive and unnecessarily complicated—as this recommendation rightly notes. It would be as if the postman had to pay royalties when delivering a book to its recipient. What would truly benefit culture would be if art and information could be transmitted conveniently and securely, directly from the artist to the user, the consumer. This new framework offers, above all, enormous possibilities for creating and transmitting culture in a way never before seen. It is essential that the interests of all parties involved be taken into account. This is precisely what this Parliament has sought to take into account in its recommendation. (NL) Mr. President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the work she has done. The Commission has the impression that it has worked quickly and concisely. That is important. It is now up to the Commission to express its thanks to the rapporteur. I will immediately inform you of the Commission's conclusion: we agree with the conclusions of the draft recommendation. This therefore means that the Commission agrees with Parliament's ratification. I would like to emphasize the importance of both Treaties. The WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty both constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and related rights and will therefore substantially improve the Berne and Rome Treaties. Both Treaties will contribute to a high level of protection for works and other things, but they also offer the public access to content through electronic networks. Both Treaties explicitly allow the Community to become a contracting party and to play an important role in managing this area. Therefore, the adoption of the Treaties is of great importance, as it is evident that the Community attaches great importance to intellectual property rights. Adoption also leads to greater international recognition of the European Union's role in the field of copyright. Internationally, there is strong support for a speedier entry into force of the Treaties. They have now been ratified by thirteen and twelve WIPO Member States, respectively, including the United States. This entry into force depends largely on the European Union, because thirty instruments of ratification are required for the entry into force of the Treaties, and these instruments, which must be signed by the European Union and the Member States, plus the associated countries, are of great importance in achieving this number. Furthermore, many developing countries hope that the European Union will ratify them quickly, as this would send a positive signal to the entire world.	es
Finally, the report insists on measures to support ethnic or social minorities. We can only express our disapproval of a minority policy which would ultimately prove dangerous for social cohesion. On the one hand, it encourages the integration of immigrants when instead their assimilation into the culture of the host country should be encouraged in order to avoid the appearance of ethnic ghettos which would create so many urban powder kegs. On the other hand, it makes use of the principle of positive discrimination, a politically correct and harmful chimera, as the American precedent has shown. For all these reasons, the French delegation of the UEN Group was unable to approve Mrs McCarthy's report. Decourrière report (A5-0028/2000) Mr President, the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts. Like many of my colleagues, I am delighted that the European Parliament has succeeded in maintaining the INTERREG initiative. I, who live in the Belgian region of Sarre-Lor-Lux Sud, know that it is there that Europe is created, that Europe is experienced on a daily basis and that, in fact, the citizen participates fully in the construction of Europe. These projects should be taken into consideration and must already be part of sustainable development. Why do I insist on this point? Simply because the projects currently presented are too often still destructive of the environment, precisely because of the way in which they are presented. For example, accepting the construction of new roads is equivalent to accepting new forms of pollution within the European Union and this is completely contrary to the policies that we propose in terms of combating greenhouse gas emissions, for example. I also ask that, in the context of the projects presented, the Commission ensure the presence of the environmental pillar of European Union policy, so that the objective of reducing, for example, CO2 can tomorrow become a pilot added value of the proposed projects. I am thinking in particular of certain infrastructures currently being built. It is known that some Member States still have to choose between rail and road, for example, when crossing vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees, and I am thinking in particular of the Aspe Valley; but I am also thinking of my own region, where the State has not yet decided whether to allow the railway to pass, while instead it is proposing a second motorway, the A32. Here too, I would ask the Commission to pay particular attention to cohesion between the various policies, in particular between the INTERREG programmes presented. Mr President, I voted in favour of the Decourrière report on the INTERREG Community initiative, above all because of the response that Commissioner Barnier gave to some Members who spoke and asked that more attention be paid, in this programme, to border regions whose borders are marked by the sea, and this not only because I was born in a seaside town, Genoa, but above all because those of the regions bordered by the sea are also borders. These borders take us to the states of Africa and the Middle East: we must take into greater consideration the fact that it is also important to develop the coastal regions of any part of Europe. . (FR) As a Member of the European Parliament from a border region, I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest.	it
It is high time that the polluters started paying because, until now, it is the victims and the taxpayers who have been paying. And not only are they paying, but they are also cleaning up the affected areas. I therefore welcome Mr Fischler's response, especially when he acknowledges the need to apply retroactive measures and respond quickly to requests that arise. On behalf of my group, the Socialist Group, I want to send a message of solidarity to the victims, to the fishermen, the fish and oyster farmers and the industrialists who ensure that seafood arrives on time at the market; to the mayors and politicians, and to the volunteers who cleaned up. We express our full solidarity with them. I would like to ask the Commissioner two questions. Parliament adopted a resolution on the application of the polluter pays principle to this type of case and on the liability of shipowners and cargo owners. My question to the Commissioner is whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will receive compensation from these people. The second point concerns the future and the publication of the Commission's White Paper on Environmental Liability, the purpose of which is to ensure the future application of the polluter-pays principle and to improve our ability to enforce European environmental legislation. This White Paper recognizes that liability is only effective if the polluter is identifiable, if the damage can be quantified, and if a clear cause-and-effect relationship can be established between the two. The sinking of the Erika could not better illustrate this point because it sums up exactly what the White Paper aims to tackle. This question would therefore seem to be the best measure for dealing with such problems in the future. The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by dangerous activities regulated at Community level, and I wonder—and perhaps the Commissioner can answer this question—whether the White Paper on Environmental Liability will be able to address problems such as the Erika, whether it will actually be able to address this concern, or whether, in practice, when it comes to maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas, polluters will once again escape the obligation to pay compensation for the damage they have caused. Mr President, our sympathies and expressions of solidarity go out to the people and regions affected by the disaster. But good intentions are not enough; the damage must be compensated and the losses made good, both in terms of environmental restoration and shellfish farming facilities and fishing equipment. We are pleased to hear the Commissioner express the need to act and provide compensation quickly and retroactively. We also denounce excessively lax control of ships and we are in favour of the creation of a European coastguard corps, and in particular the requirement for more restrictive regulations and the requirement to have double-hulled boats.	fr
This must no longer be just an option for us, but an imperative. The citizens of Europe will not settle for anything less than a quality of life that is worthy of human beings. We do not want to follow the American model, a model that has not created the jobs that are absolutely necessary to ensure an acceptable quality of life. In the United States, the number of poor people in employment has increased incredibly, and that is not what we want in Europe. We have a tradition of solidarity in Europe and we know a better way of doing things. But for this, we need to have the right tools, and so I am calling not only for the high-level group proposed by the Commission to be set up, but also for us to go further and launch a process similar to that of Luxembourg so that we can take an integrated approach to the issue of social protection. Mr President, Commissioner, this is one of the social issues that the European Union must pay much greater attention to. Macroeconomic policies, the Stability Pact and the nominal convergence criteria have, in fact, hindered a modernisation of social protection that would enable it to contribute to improving the quality of life of the population, in particular by significantly increasing pensions and retirement benefits - especially their minimum levels - and by combating social exclusion. The situation is particularly serious in countries such as Portugal, where minimum pensions and retirement benefits are just over half the national minimum wage, which is the lowest in the European Union. We will therefore have very serious doubts about the Commission's true position until it takes on the need to review macroeconomic policies in order to create high-quality jobs that guarantee all workers' rights. These are in fact the fundamental prerequisite for maintaining and modernising a truly solid public social protection system. Although the Andersson report has incorporated positive proposals, some of which bear our signature, some of the principles we criticised in the Commission's communication remain unchanged. We therefore remain concerned about the strategy for modernising social protection. Mr President, I have previously managed two manufacturing companies, one in the UK and one in the Netherlands. As the UK company grew, we invested in staff; as the Dutch company grew, we invested in machinery. This was because social security costs in the Netherlands are higher than in the UK. I am in favour of social protection and of the original Commission document, but I do not want jobs to become too expensive because social protection costs are indiscriminately rising. That is why I proposed in committee that we should apply some form of economic impact assessment of the business directive that takes into account the costs and risks in terms of employment. The PPE-DE Group supported this amendment. However, I must note that other groups, led by the PSE Group and my compatriot, Stephen Hughes, rejected this amendment. I am sure that the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, had the best intentions and I respect him for the work he has done, but I believe that the way in which the report defines and promotes social convergence would lead to an increase in social security costs throughout the European Union which would put at risk a large number of jobs and also the credibility of this House, demonstrating how far we are from the real world.	it
I believe that, as far as the specific case of the Erika is concerned, measures are being taken and actions are being organized with the French authorities. But what concerns us in this case is that we must debate this issue again, because the key to the issue is preventive measures. The Commissioner for Fisheries has indicated - and I would like to emphasize this - that the Commission will meet and adopt a package of technical and legal measures. I believe that this is the way forward. I would simply like to say that these measures are welcome and that the members of the Committee on Fisheries will monitor these measures very closely so that we no longer have to meet in this Parliament to deplore events such as this. I have received, in accordance with Rule 42(2) of the Rules of Procedure, five motions for resolutions. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 11 a.m. EC/Israel Trade Agreement The next item is the oral question (B5-0012/2000) by Mrs Morgantini and others to the Commission, on irregularities in the application of the EC/Israel trade agreement. In reality, we have to debate today a simple matter: respect for, application of, and monitoring of the agreements to which the European Union subscribes, respect for the treaties and international standards to which the European Union adheres. It is a simple matter, but in this world, it is often the simplest things that cause the most problems. The colleagues who signed the question to the Commission with me want the correct application of the Israel-EC trade agreement, which – not only do we have reason to believe, but we, like several Member States, have concrete evidence – is openly violated by Israel. We also have reason to believe that the Commission is not sticking to what should be its basic mission: to be the guardian of the Community treaties. We are talking about Article 38 of the territorial clause, which limits the scope of application to the territory of the State of Israel and therefore does not authorise the granting of customs facilities to products originating from the territories militarily occupied since June 1967, in which, in defiance of all international law, starting with the Fourth Geneva Convention, successive Israeli governments have established settlements by confiscating the Palestinians' land and rivers and installing new inhabitants there. This is not the first time that the Commission and Parliament have addressed these issues. I will only recall the Commission's report to the Council and Parliament presented in May 1998, which criticized Israel's refusal to apply the protocol on laws of origin as referred to in Article 38. Despite this, the Commission has not succeeded in forcing Israel to respect these agreements and has given vague answers to the various questions from parliamentarians, constantly referring to the difficulty of obtaining reliable proof of the origin of products, even though it has always reminded Israel of the legal obligations of the agreement. In order to facilitate the task of the Commission and the Member States, an Israeli peace movement published a list of companies established in the settlements and a Palestinian NGO has gathered and presented to the customs authorities of the various Member States irrefutable evidence on the origin of several products from the occupied territories and marketed in the Community.	fr
This is of course a positive thing, but it would be essential for it to refer to the monitoring of the European Parliament's recommendations in our discharge procedure. Will you add this to your committee's work on the progress of the audit? Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with an activity-based budget and the need for accountability because, as President Prodi said, you will be judged on your actions and not your words. As Mrs Morgan said, a crucial factor will be to reconnect with the European public, and this will require actions and not words. I say this with all due respect to the European Parliament, which has some real masters of eloquence; we will try to set a good example. As far as excessive bureaucracy is concerned, Mrs Morgan has clearly defined our dilemma. We too hate mountains of paper, but because of the requirements that we have to check, re-check and re-check to ensure effective financial control, administrative requirements that some call bureaucracy are unavoidable. However, to minimise these requirements, we are not just discussing them; in the near future we will appoint a Deputy Secretary-General, an additional Deputy Secretary-General specifically responsible for identifying best practices and disseminating them in the Commission, and also ensuring a radical reduction in those procedures that produce paper and bureaucracy. They generate a great deal of frustration, not only among citizens and businesses in the Union, but also among those who work for the Commission. We will certainly fight to achieve this, and I believe that the effects will be felt in the coming years. One of our difficulties, of course, will be that the more effective the reform process, the less information there will be in circulation about it; We will therefore have to count on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain, with their usual generosity, the efforts made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe. I know that I can count on all of you. The debate on this point is over. I thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock. Statement by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy The next item on the agenda is the statement by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. I would like to extend a warm welcome to the High Representative, Javier Solana, who has the floor. B (ES) Madam President, as you can imagine, it gives me great pleasure to be back before the European Parliament once again. Ladies and gentlemen, since the last time I came to speak about foreign and security policy issues on our continent, a lot has happened. Sometimes you might think that too much has happened. Today I would like to share with you some ideas, mainly about the common foreign and security policy. It is true, as I have said, that the world has undergone many changes in recent months and that many events have occurred; however, if you agree, I will answer questions during the time allotted for this purpose.	it
In this context, I would like to underline the adoption in May 1999 of a new rural development support scheme, which constitutes the Community framework of reference for sustainable rural development. This has been, as you know, one of the developments that has taken place in the negotiations for Agenda 2000 and in the very evolution of the treatment of agricultural issues at the Community level. Through the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), this Community support framework is intended to help reverse the trend toward desertification of rural areas, to which the Honourable Member rightly refers in his question. Furthermore, the European Fund for Rural Development (ERDF) also contributes, within the scope of its mission, to promoting economic and social cohesion by correcting the main regional imbalances and by participating in the development and conversion of rural areas. In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and the sustainable creation of jobs in rural areas. These Community instruments are what allow us to work with a rural development policy that is today, moreover, one of the developments and lines of evolution of the Common Agricultural Policy, in one of its dimensions, and of regional policy, on the other hand. We believe that within the concept of multifunctionality currently linked to the evolution of the Common Agricultural Policy, this is one of the fundamental issues, and the EAGGF Guarantee Fund naturally has a fundamental role to play in this regard. Question No. 9 by (H-0798/99): Subject: Agriculture and the Portuguese Presidency Can the Council outline the Portuguese Presidency's priorities for the next six months with regard to the common agricultural policy, and also indicate the steps it considers necessary to increase consumer confidence in both the agricultural sector and products that have been adversely affected by the alarm caused by the recent health crises? The question that the Honourable Member raises regarding the common agricultural policy is one that affects us closely and is worth constantly considering in the debates of this House, because we will probably have a lot to say on this issue in the future. During the Portuguese Presidency, we will continue the process of reviewing the CAP by adapting some of the common market organizations with a view to the harmonious development of the Union's rural areas and ensuring a positive trend in farmers' incomes, paying particular attention to measures that may have an impact on small family farms. Furthermore, the Portuguese Presidency will naturally, if and when the new round of negotiations for the World Trade Organization begins during its Presidency, which is by no means certain, ensure the consolidation of the presence of Community production on international markets and a greater balance between exported Community agricultural products and the preservation of a multifunctional European agriculture, as I have just mentioned. The Portuguese Presidency will also emphasize the intensification of food security policy, and I believe that the Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of the Council of the European Union has already referred to this aspect here this morning. We believe that the role of food security, particularly in all aspects related to public health, is a fundamental element of our Presidency; moreover, it constitutes one of the priorities of our program.	es
I do not agree with the paragraphs concerning Parliament. This report concerns the Commission. Parliament is a separate subject. There is no justification for introducing Parliament into the discussion on the Commission. There is also the issue of duty-free shopping. This was an argument against the Commission put forward by the lobbies opposed to the abolition of duty-free sales at airports. This subject also has no place in the report. The report mainly concerns financial control. This is reasonable, because it comes from the Committee on Budgetary Control. But we should not give the impression that vast amounts of European resources are at risk due to the negligence of the European Commission. After all, this represents only 1% of GDP compared to national expenditure. We have already discussed this, but some in Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how limited the European Union's financial resources are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States. The Commission's negligence in its spending will therefore not threaten vast amounts of money. We should take that into account. It is an important element to bear in mind. The European Commission's action is very limited when it comes to spending. Its role is very limited. Its responsibility is much greater. Responsibility for environmental management, food safety, foreign trade, the internal market, and many other responsibilities that we have entrusted to the Commission without providing it with the necessary resources to fulfill them. I am not one of those who thinks there is a serious lack of trust. If there is, it was we in Parliament who created it last year. I have been here for 20 years, and I have always seen absolute trust between the Council, the Commission, and Parliament. We have had problems, we have identified difficulties, but the citizens of the European Union have never lacked confidence in this bureaucratic Commission, they have never doubted it or feared it because it mismanaged our affairs. This is a great exaggeration of what the difficulties were. This Commission should not be forced to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the Commission's resignation and that preceded it. When there are problems that we have to solve with a view to enlargement, for example, we sometimes overemphasize their negative side. Mr President, allow me to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his report. I hope that the Commission will draw inspiration from it in its reform work. The reform process has been underway for some time, and there seems to be a kind of state of emergency within the Commission. It is clear that the way in which the Commission administers affairs is not particularly good. There are obviously capable and competent officials within the Commission; they even represent the majority, but we need radical reforms. There is too little action and too much bureaucracy.	fr
It is better to heed calls for amendments and improvements to current legislation than to rush into new proposals. Within this framework, I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspections. I support calls for classification societies to effectively monitor the structural conditions of vessels and to be held accountable for their actions. Calls for improvements in hull design, particularly for vessels to have double hulls, are sound, but their implementation across the entire fleet takes time. They cannot replace regular and rigorous inspections. Mr. President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, primarily those on the Committees on Transport and the Environment, for not forgetting that this disaster also affects the fishing sector. Because, in addition to the irreparable damage to the environment, the damage to the ecosystem, and the losses to the tourism sector, the oil spill is a blow to fishing and to the conservation of marine resources, and it will take many years to recover the damaged coastline. It is no coincidence, Commissioner, that the affected areas are always those European regions lagging behind in development, those that barely survive on the tourism-fishing trade and, in most cases, lack other resources. These are the same regions, Commissioner, that already endure, year-round, the reckless practices of certain shipowners who clean the bottoms of their vessels off their coasts, beyond any control. I come from a region, Galicia, that has suffered similar accidents in the past. Brittany and Galicia, the two European Finisterres, are permanent victims of the irresponsibility of those who prefer to flout safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels that are themselves potential oil spills. That is why I believe it is necessary to act in two directions. On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the aid planned for the fishing sector, to implement special measures to mitigate the effects of this disaster on the productive sector in the affected areas, and also by asking it, both from international organizations and itself, to strictly monitor vessels flying flags of convenience. In this regard, the current negotiation process for Malta's accession to the European Union should serve to require this country to strictly monitor oil tankers flying its flag. On the other hand, prevention is necessary. Portugal is a country that has amply demonstrated its sensitivity to issues related to the sea. I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of launching a comprehensive maritime accident prevention strategy at the European level, concentrating all the resources we already have at our disposal—technological, structural, and socioeconomic—to prevent a catastrophe like this from happening again in the future. Finally, Mr. President, I would like to highlight the work done by the volunteers and local authorities, which reminded me of old times when I—then mayor—experienced similar situations.	es
This is a transparent and strong way of proceeding, to involve all the European institutions and the European population. This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement imposes on us, an enlargement that forces us to rethink the functioning of all our institutions, to rethink our own policies - all our policies - to rethink above all what we must continue to do at the level of the Union when the member countries will be twenty-five or thirty, what will be better to do at the level of individual states, at the level of the regions and at the level of local administrations. But it is not only enlargement that pushes us to this rethinking: as said earlier, it is also the globalization of the economy and politics itself. We must govern Europe in such a way as to be more efficient, closer to the citizens, promoting the participation of all, starting first of all with the great problem of female participation. One of the great differences in the comparison made in this period between Europe and the United States is not so much the mobility of labor or the problem of risk capital, but rather the participation of women in economic life, a participation that in the United States has a much greater importance than in Europe. This is a field in which Europe has always been at the forefront: we must therefore reflect on this deeply, with openness, and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to think about their own role, their own policies. We will therefore immediately return to work on this White Paper, even if we will have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference to complete it, and therefore it cannot be presented before spring 2001. It will not be a book of philosophy, but a concrete book, full of precise proposals. We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must rethink this completely, and for this reason we will do two things: we will commit ourselves and are committing ourselves fully to internal reform, and we will rethink our policies in depth. I have asked all the Commissioners - and we will ask them even more analytically - to identify all the activities that can be abandoned. The Commission must define what its core activities are, those on which it must concentrate, and give up non-essential activities, so as to free up new resources and to have a more correct and more cooperative relationship with individual countries, regions and local communities. We will therefore free up new resources, but the time will also come - I fear, and I want to say this here in front of Parliament - when even these new resources that we are already freeing up will not be sufficient to allow us to deal with our new tasks: I am thinking of enlargement, the new sector of justice and home affairs, health problems, environmental problems. On that day, when we will have used all our resources to the fullest, I will not hesitate to come before you to ask for new resources, but I say from now that, if we do not have the necessary resources, we will have to refuse to take on any new task because there is no consistency between the new tasks we are taking on and the resources we have at our disposal.	it
"I find it serious that the Commission is not addressing cohesion. It is postponing a principle of the Treaties—that of economic and social cohesion—which should inspire all policies and measures of the European institutions. It seems unaware that profound backwardness persists in several European regions, and it forgets that enlargement justifies adjustments in regional policy. Without real convergence, the cohesion of the European Union will be at risk. Consider the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions of the European Union, a commission from the Commission. It confirms that, for an average level of development attributed to 100, the ten regions designated as ""strongest"" reach an average of 158, and the ten so-called ""weakest"" are around 50. Draw your own conclusions about this. 50: that is exactly the level of development of the region where I live—the Azores—one of those designated as outermost in the Treaties. I await the Commission's report on the outermost regions, which the Council determined would be prepared by December 1999. I conclude by reaffirming my conviction: without economic and social cohesion, there will be no cohesion whatsoever, only disintegration. Madam President, Mr. President, we need, European public opinion needs, a strong Commission, because, as the Treaties intended, as the will of the people also intended, the Commission is the driving force of European construction, that rock of Sisyphus that we must push to the summit after each enlargement. Therefore, a strong Commission, but one that relies on a Parliament, and Parliament is therefore its ally, but an awkward ally, whose messages we must hear, and I would like to give one or two in this brief speech. First of all, Mr. President, I believe that, if your two predecessors were essentially dedicated to developing an internal market and establishing a single currency, it is primarily your responsibility to develop all this civic value that is at the heart of European construction. Indeed, we must not allow ourselves to be distracted, whatever its importance, solely by the issue of enlargement. We must go further, towards the reconciliation of citizens with Europe and, above all, those citizens who are victims of economic, social, and, undoubtedly, in the future, technological fractures. The promotion of scientific development, the promotion of new technologies, and access for all to these technologies will not be guaranteed by the market and competition, any more than the market and competition will ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of major public services: health, education, transport, communications, water, and who knows how much more. Your action program and your objectives are discreet, even silent, specifically regarding the necessary revival of public investment. They are also discreet, even silent, regarding the consolidation and financing of major public services and services of general interest. In that case, Mr. President, if you wish to reconcile Europe with citizens, there is an absolute priority to act in such a way that they choose Europe rather than Jörg Haider."	es
"Firstly, the Committee on Development and Cooperation wants nothing more than to see the EDF communitarised, and in doing so, it has clearly chosen the wrong path. We believe that cooperation is an intergovernmental task and that is how it must remain. As Europe prepares for enlargement, communitarising the EDF would allow some to simply hide their lack of commitment behind the protective shield of the Community budget, quite apart from abandoning a fruitful and promising method by which we can involve our partner countries in the South in our cooperation policy. Finally, the Commission has recently demonstrated – as Mrs Maes very rightly pointed out earlier – the difficulties it has in managing the funds it has made available for its development and humanitarian aid programmes in a completely transparent manner. The question arises as to why we should now add further programmes. Secondly, we find it extremely regrettable that Mr Corrie's report mentions the Trade and Development Agreement with South Africa, because ultimately this agreement is an example of the unprofessional diplomacy that the European Commission is increasingly engaging in. We are, in fact, utterly astonished to discover that the Union has negotiated an agreement for its Member States in which a significant part has simply been omitted. Incidentally, it is even more incredible that the Council allowed this to happen. We now find ourselves in the absurd situation of having to negotiate from a position of weakness on such vital aspects as wine and agricultural production, within the framework of an agreement that we have already signed. The part of this agreement that is blocking negotiations could mean that the Union will have to compensate producers to stop producing sherry and port. These are a whole range of products that are, quite simply, counterfeit under international trade law, and the potential cost of such a precedent can be imagined. This is proof, if it were still possible to prove it, that an immature diplomacy that represents no interests whatsoever—except particular interests caught between the doctrine of free trade, lobbies, and more or less friendly NGOs—is not only ineffective but even dangerous. Finally, a word about the general thrust of the Corrie report. Today, the Joint Assembly—we will not hide this fact—is viewed by the ""theologians"" in Geneva and Washington as an obstacle to international free trade. This could have been an opportunity for us to recall that our form of independent and exemplary cooperation with the countries of the South should be further developed and strengthened. The Corrie report missed this opportunity, and we regret that it was squandered in this way. Mr. President, as a conclusion and summary, I would like to highlight three essential aspects of this debate. First, and more generally, the views expressed clearly demonstrate that globalization is deepening regional disproportions and social inequalities and increasing poverty. This suggests that action must be taken, otherwise tensions will intensify and conflicts will emerge, threatening international peace and stability. Second, from this perspective, it is essential to give development policy a new dimension by enhancing its role in correcting disproportions and reducing inequalities."	de
The fact that, as you know, the President of the Republic in Finland is not only a representative office but also the supreme commander of the army, adds to the historic significance of this event. During the Finnish Presidency, a report was drawn up which described the entire decision-making process in great detail; I hope that it will serve as a reference when the Commission proposes legally binding measures to improve the role of women in the decision-making process. I would invite all of you, Members of the Right, to listen carefully to Mrs Lulling's speech on the need for fixed quotas, as she has more political experience in this area than anyone else. Finally, I would like to stress that this issue should also be addressed at the next Intergovernmental Conference. I would therefore ask you, ladies and gentlemen, not to vote in favour of the proposal amending point 4, thus allowing the issue of gender democracy not to be addressed at the Intergovernmental Conference. Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, despite the progress made in legislation and the complaints we regularly express about gender inequalities and discrimination, the proposals developed to resolve the problem do not eliminate the underlying causes; this means that in order to ensure equal participation of women in the decision-making process, it is necessary to reform policies in various areas. We know that this is the area that presents the greatest difficulties, both because women continue to bear the main responsibilities related to family life and because prejudices and interests persist that hinder the effective participation of women in the areas of greatest responsibility. The truth is that the low participation of women in political representation centres and decision-making bodies implies a democratic deficit that is incompatible with effective democracy. It is therefore essential to implement the directives on equal opportunities and for the Council, the Commission and each Member State to firmly respect the commitments made, in particular in the context of the Beijing Conference. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am a right-wing Member of Parliament, but I am fighting the same battles as my colleagues to support and help women citizens to gain access to power and decision-making bodies - something that must be done not only in the political sphere but also, of course, in all sectors of society. In short, I would point out that there are many ways to gain access to it and, if I am particularly opposed to the phenomenon of quotas, because I find it particularly contemptuous of women, I come from a country where equality has only just been established. It is perfectly logical, it is coherent! All this should have been there a long time ago because women represent more than half of society and it seems completely normal to me that they are present, at least 50 percent, if not more, in decision-making bodies and in politics. I am therefore against discriminatory measures to impose women. Women impose themselves because they are pragmatic and have common sense. When I realize that we ask for training for women in politics, I am tempted to say: absolutely not.	it
These neighbourhoods of our cities are often home to single-parent families, elderly people who are living on pensions and who no longer carry out any productive activity, families in difficulty, if not in disintegration and disarray. They live in areas that should be able to benefit from these projects. If we succeed in implementing this three-pronged approach, I believe that these families, these people, these European citizens will be able to be more creative throughout Europe, which I think is very important because, after all, cities will increasingly play a leading role on the European stage. Mr President, I would like to speak on the URBAN and INTERREG programmes, which many speakers have mentioned. After me, my colleagues Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou will speak, since all three of us are responsible for these Community initiatives and have had the opportunity to follow this debate with great attention. First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs of the parliamentary committees, of all the committees, as well as the spokespersons of the groups and all the Members for the high quality and the deep interest shown in their speeches on these two initiatives. This is particularly true of what Mrs McCarthy said on URBAN, and I would like to thank her not only for her work and for the report she has presented but also, why not say it, for what we and you owe her for this initiative and for what we owe more generally to your Parliament. Indeed, I do not forget that it was actually the European Parliament that took the political decision to maintain this initiative in favour of the revitalisation of urban areas in crisis and sustainable urban development, also promoting an integrated approach, which is very important to us, to address economic, social and environmental aspects at the same time. Mrs McCarthy's report highlights other points on which we agree, which are: the effectiveness of this instrument thanks to financial concentration and a critical mass for interventions; the horizontal mechanism, which in our opinion is more conducive to the dissemination of results and the multiplication of exchanges of experiences and good practices; the growing role of local authorities in the design and management of programmes based on a genuine partnership. Having recalled the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission's proposals and Parliament and having stressed the great interest I felt in listening to the various speeches, I would like to respond to some criticisms and some suggestions, apologising in advance for not being able to quote each speaker personally. I believe, however, that everyone will recognise themselves. First of all, with regard to the URBAN programme, I understand that a maximum of 50 cities, which some of you have described as arbitrary, is a cause for concern. I have therefore asked my services to be prepared to assess a reasonable increase in the number of cities eligible for the URBAN programme with certain guarantees, first of all on population density - I am thinking in particular of intervention areas that must have a minimum of 20,000 inhabitants and exceptionally 10,000 inhabitants - as well as on financial critical mass: we should stick to 500 euros per inhabitant so that the European Union's intervention is effective and at the same time visible and does not get lost in a random distribution that would make it incomprehensible for citizens and municipalities.	it
First, the classic ideological deviation, Eurofederalist, a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomacy, a single army and now a single criminal law and a single prosecutor. All this to fight against fraud of less than one billion euros while tens of billions are being let go for GSPs, for free trade zones, for customs gifts to Chiquita and for the billions lost on the fourth resource, GDP, due to the austerity pact on the budget. Then there is the puritanical deviation: Northern German Europe, Lutheran, Calvinist, Quaker Europe wants to impose its moral order on us. After all, the more we let ourselves go with customs, the more we tighten the purse strings. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today more than ever, effective criminal protection of the financial interests of the European Union is essential. The scandals of the past related to fraud and corruption have seriously shaken the confidence of European citizens. The credibility of the European Parliament's commitment to ensuring the correct use of financial resources is closely linked to our commitment to investigations into the past and future prevention. The changes needed are not only administrative but also structural; in other words, we must create the tools to ensure criminal protection that is currently non-existent. The 2000 Intergovernmental Conference seems to me to be the most appropriate forum for this debate. Obviously, there are also those who maintain that criminal law and criminal procedure are matters that fall exclusively within the competence of the Member States and that the principle of subsidiarity excludes any other consideration in this regard. There is no doubt that I personally count myself among the advocates of this latter principle, being opposed to any further extension of Europe's supranational competences. Precisely in the light of the requests addressed to the Intergovernmental Conference, the emphasis must be placed on a clear separation of competences. However, I do not see any contradiction in this with the call for the creation of criminal and criminal procedure instruments, which are the subject of recommendations 1 and 2 of the report, since these are interests that indisputably concern the whole of the European Union and as such do not harm the legal interests of the Member States, but rather promote them at least indirectly. Experts have confirmed their compatibility with the various national legal systems, which shows that Europe also has much in common in the area of criminal law, for example with regard to the types of crime involved. In the light of these considerations, I consider the creation of such a framework as proposed to be appropriate, and I even consider it necessary for the coherent development of OLAF. Mr President, will a European Public Prosecutor be able to eliminate fraud involving Community funds? I do not think so. On the other hand, we can achieve substantial results with the existing instruments. An alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be EUROJUST, as proposed at the last European Summit. EUROJUST, in its architecture, should be under the control of EUROPOL and provide support for investigations in the case of criminal offences. Practical cooperation of this nature is what we need.	it
This is a distant goal, but it can be achieved in stages. The most important will be the harmonisation of State rights, but for today let us be content with this small step because it goes in the right direction. Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory memorandum, which points out some of the serious shortcomings of this proposal. The lack of clarity of expression will inevitably give rise to legal uncertainty, whereas legal certainty is essential in such vital matters. Due to poor wording, the Convention can be interpreted in very different ways and ignores the strict conditions to which interception should be subject according to the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 18 allows interceptions to be carried out in another Member State without informing it. Not only should this Article be deleted, but the entire title should be removed. The user requirements that form the basis of the current legislation were drafted at the initiative of the FBI. The Council proposal that includes these requirements, ENFOPOL 98, was approved by Parliament last May with the Schmid report. We are now being asked to provide the legal basis for such interception, and it would be appropriate to consider combining these two documents. The requirements propose to allow authorities to access all service providers' equipment (telephones, mobile phones, Internet), and given the current very poor wording, the proposal is open to abuse. I would like to ask a question: given that the user requirements specify that the police can access all service providers without exception, does this include Parliament's internal services? Are we passing legislation that will allow the police, on very flimsy grounds, to access our systems? Furthermore, this proposal does not include any definition of a serious crime, thus encouraging all kinds of abuse. Furthermore, as regards the reversal of the burden of proof, something recognised in fundamental international law, the presumption of innocence is essential, but is not guaranteed here. Neither the preamble nor the main body of the text take due account of the rights of the defence, an essential principle of fundamental international rights. This is a very serious issue; We are very concerned about the direction we are about to take without the issue being debated publicly in national parliaments or elsewhere, and without involving civil rights movements across Europe. They too are anxious about recent developments. Mr President, I am not a member of the Legal Affairs Committee nor am I a lawyer, but, like almost all my fellow Members, I understand how important it is for the European Economic Area to be accompanied by a single area of justice, freedom and security. In this sense, issues relating to judicial cooperation in criminal law are particularly relevant. Reading the texts in question, I have come to the conclusion that it is risky to rely on the provisions issued by the Council, while maintaining the contradictions, the conflicting opinions on what Europe is and the different judicial systems that cause not only confusion and ineffectiveness, but also dangerous situations. I am referring, for example, to Article 18, mentioned by some speakers, according to which any country - or rather, any large country - having the technical capacity could intercept the communications of another State even without the latter's authorisation.	it
Mr. Provan said that I often speak about tourism and information technology. I am personally convinced that information and communications technology will play a key innovative role in European tourism. The travel and tourism sector is at the forefront of the use of information and communications technology tools. This will profoundly change the way it operates. Marketing, booking, and transportation are expected to be the areas that will undergo the greatest changes and improvements. The use of these technologies opens up a completely new dimension in the field of travel and tourism. Direct contact between the consumer and the company will complement, and sometimes even reduce, the current and almost exclusive business-to-business relationship. The offerings for tourists will be broader and better, and new, higher-quality products will be created. To achieve this, the Commission believes, action in the tourism sector must be closely linked to measures to promote the adoption of information and communications technology by the tourism industry, in particular through the Technology Programme for Innovation and the Technology Programme for an Innovative Society, both of which fall within my remit. The new strategy set out in the Commission Communication on Tourism and Employment, approved by the Council, places emphasis on the collection and dissemination of information on tourism and on good practice. Implementation of the Statistics Directive aims to improve knowledge of the structures and trends of the European tourism market and the sector concerned. The Commission's decisions have advanced the methodological approach. The report on the experience gained in the work carried out under this Directive is part of our work programme for the current year. Additional work on the social and economic impact of tourism is currently being carried out in collaboration with international organisations such as the World Tourism Organisation. The primary role of the European Community is to provide a framework that enables and encourages stakeholders and authorities at all levels to optimize and realize the tourism sector's growth and employment potential. Such a European strategy will be achieved by building on the commitment of the Member States and the Commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas: exchange and dissemination of information, including through new technologies; training to improve skills; quality of tourism products; and sustainable development in the tourism sector. In the autumn, the Commission will report on progress made in this regard. In about two years, a report on the work to be undertaken jointly with the Member States and the tourism sector should be available. Depending on the results of this work, a broader debate could then take place, which could well be the starting point for even more comprehensive policy initiatives. Mr. Medina Ortega asked me some very specific questions. Regarding the role of tourism policy in the communities concerned, we must understand that many policy sectors have a huge impact on the structure of tourism. It is not only specific, targeted tourism actions that are important; there are also other horizontal actions in the transport sector. Currently, air and road congestion is the fundamental problem. In the environmental field, we are examining methods of cooperation with Ms. Wallström; in the field of regional policy, Mr. Barnier is paying great attention to this sector.	fr
Mr. President, I have heard Commissioner Vitorino's response and I must say that I am satisfied. It seems to me that his intervention attempts to answer the questions contained in the question. I also believe that we must emphasize the importance, for the European Union and, consequently and from an executive perspective, for the Commission, of promoting tripartite activities, particularly with regard to the levels of economic, financial, and scientific cooperation, in order to ensure that our quantitative presence, in terms of money, can increasingly become a more significant political presence in the Middle East. I believe this is the lesson we must draw from a situation that has been going on for a long time. Regarding the case at hand, I just heard Mr. Galeote refer to our President's visit, and Mr. Menéndez del Valle to President Prodi's visit to Israel and other Middle Eastern countries. I believe that both Presidents were right not to include this issue on their agenda: everything must have its place, and each level, obviously, must have its priorities. I believe it was a good idea for the two highest representatives of Parliament and the Commission to address the most sensitive issues of the peace process, which, as we know, continues to encounter difficulties. We must fully support this peace process, and the attention we pay to these events denounced in Ms. Morgantini's question is not a prejudicial or detrimental attention to one of the parties involved: it is the strictness of friends, it is strictness with the friendly government of Israel so that these illegalities and irregularities are not repeated, as they harm everyone. From this point of view, this initiative must also be understood positively, as an initiative that seeks to foster the peace process in the Middle East. Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current trade agreement between Israel and the EC is indeed confusing. Furthermore, it is very difficult to determine the origin of the products in question. I therefore maintain that it is desirable to clarify this as soon as possible. However, there are other important factors that we must take into account. After all, we are all in complete agreement that the relaunch of peace negotiations should be encouraged, not hindered. For the time being, Israel and the Palestinians have negotiated their future borders in depth. Any effort by anyone trying to define, let alone impose, the territorial scope of application, even when it involves a third party, seems premature at this point. It seems better to me to await the results regarding the rules of origin of the tripartite working group, which will be set up jointly at the initiative of Israel, the European Commission, and also the Palestinians. I am pleased that the Commissioner also shares my opinion. I hope that this working group will find an interim solution to the problem within the current legal framework, without jeopardizing the peace process.	es
Today, in many states, this is not possible. One of the reasons for the difference in competitiveness between the European Area and, for example, the United States, is precisely this ability to bounce back that exists on the other side of the ocean and which we do not know about. I believe that, since we have gone this far and will continue on this path, which is the path of creating a collective procedure for settling this type of dispute uniformly in the European Union, we must think about ensuring that this does not become the allegorical figure of the guillotine. Mr President, my dear friends, Commissioner, I believe that if we have so far avoided a number of disasters that could have occurred in the absence of the rules that the previous speaker has just mentioned, we owe it more to luck than to our skill. When we deal with the internal market, we must be concerned not only with the most positive side of the project, that is, the construction of the internal market itself, but also with its downside, namely bankruptcies. I believe that we are living in a historic moment. I congratulate the rapporteur for having pushed this work forward with such diligence. Furthermore, I am proud that my home country was involved in drafting this provision, which we hope will be adopted quickly by the Council. I believe that we are about to take an important step here, even if its impact on national systems is not very noticeable. I must unfortunately inform the rapporteur that our group will not be able to support Amendment No 3. We believe that it would have a negative effect on the legal position and protection of citizens. As for Amendment No 6, we presented a similar proposal during the committee debates, and I am rather surprised that the members of the PES Group did not support it. We intend to vote in favour of this proposed Amendment 6, but I repeat, I wonder why you did not approve the text that we presented in committee. I also hope that we will achieve transparency in this context, as well as a comparison that will enable us to determine which procedures will be the best and quickest for our different countries. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, the Commission would like to point out that the proposal for a regulation under consideration this evening constitutes only and above all a new formulation of the 1995 Convention on Insolvency Procedure. Everyone knows that the Convention in question was the result of many years of debate, often difficult, often laborious, and that, as a result, it represents a compromise between the principles of unity and territoriality, that is to say, between the structuring principles of different legal systems of bankruptcy in each of our Member States. The fact that we are aware that developments in the global economic situation and, above all, in the internal market, may require more frequent recourse to bankruptcy procedures, which are often in the nature of cross-border procedures, fully justifies the Union, as such, equipping itself with the necessary binding legal instruments to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structuring principles and with guarantees of rapid execution.	fr
"These two countries are also eligible for financial support under the MEDA programme (B7-4012). During its first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament stressed that the new heading ""pre-accession"" (B7-0) proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget should not be limited to the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe, but should also be extended to Malta and Cyprus. However, due to the Council's refusal to negotiate the necessary revision of the ceiling set under heading 7 (pre-accession) of the financial perspective, the European Parliament agreed, exceptionally, and I would like to stress this fact, to finance this expenditure under heading 4 (external actions) of the financial perspective for the year 2000. At the same time, the European Parliament created a new chapter on the ""pre-accession strategy for the Mediterranean countries"" (B7-04). Within this chapter, two new articles concerning the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus have been created, pending the presentation by the Commission - following the Helsinki European Council - of the necessary legal bases, as well as the revision of the ceiling for heading 7 of the financial perspective. This proposal for a regulation should constitute one of these legal bases! I welcome Mr Brok's report which supports, with some amendments, the Commission's proposals to prepare for the accession of Cyprus and Malta to the EU. The package will provide a total of approximately EUR 15 million for the two countries during this year. However, it is regrettable that the Commission has favoured an annual allocation of funds over multiannual financing. This decision risks having repercussions on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan their expenditure. The financing will ensure the technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the acquis communautaire. Given their lead over the other candidates, these countries should not encounter any technical or administrative difficulties in gaining accession at the end of the five-year programme. Cederschiöld report (A5-0020/2000). As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the previous legislature, I welcome the adoption of this framework decision aimed at strengthening the protection of our single currency. The Union must implement all the means at its disposal to guarantee its protection against counterfeiting. Indeed, consumers and traders are not really familiar with the euro. Counterfeit money could therefore be put into circulation quite easily in supermarkets, bureaux de change and banks, without anyone noticing it immediately. As for coins, the fact that they may have a national side will make them even more difficult to identify. The European Information Centres, which already play a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency, will need to strengthen campaigns to draw public attention to counterfeiting. At a different level, cooperation between Community and national institutions will need to be ensured and an information system will need to be set up to enable the collection and exchange of data on counterfeiting. Criminal law measures are also needed to ensure the protection of the euro from the outset. It is in this context that the European Parliament has presented the draft framework decision aimed at strengthening the criminal law framework for protection against counterfeiting."	fr
However, these values only assume their full significance if they are incorporated into the Treaty in comprehensible detail and ultimately constitute legal rights for individual citizens. Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough in this case. In this sense, the Commission must insist—and I would like to confirm and reinforce this here—that the newly drafted Charter of Fundamental Rights becomes part of the Treaty and creates binding and enforceable rights. In this sense, the Commission must insist on the continuous expansion of the common area of freedom, security, and justice, and in this sense, I disagree with my two previous speakers. Only sensible, feasible, and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational, seductive, and demagogic claims of the far right. But, and I would like to emphasize this, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy on employment and against social exclusion, because unemployment, marginalization, and growing inequality are an ideal breeding ground for anti-European, nationalist sentiment and action. In this context, Mr. President of the Commission, I would also like to consider the globalization you have problematized and how it is perceived by large sections of the population. The feeling of being at the mercy of others, of lacking influence, and of lacking state protection leads, at best, to a turning away from politics and abstention, as in the European elections, and, at worst, to extremist voting behavior. Here, the Union, like all others, has not yet understood how to offer our citizens in the EU the EU as a means, indeed as protection, against the negative effects of globalization. We are in the process of building a house, but too few of our own citizens truly feel at home in this house. Therefore, this is not just about reforming the World Trade Organization and the economic architecture—and the Commission President has tellingly forgotten to mention reforming the financial institutions of the international financial architecture—but also about confidence-building measures for our citizens, who can rightly expect help and support from the EU and within the EU in the unavoidable but painful processes of adapting to the new global situation. In this context, what the Commission says about Europe's strengthening voice is important. You yourself, Mr. President, spoke today of a model about which I unfortunately find too little in the document; you said that we must offer our citizens, both internally and externally, a model of economic, social, cultural, and ecological development that is clearly different from other models, including the US model. In this sense, the US is not only our partner, but also our competitor—not opponents, but competitors—and we must fight to see who offers the best model for our citizens. I hope that what we have said today with such clear vehemence will also be reflected more strongly in the Commission's documents. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the greatest legacy your Commission could leave to the European Union would be an active contribution to the redesign and redistribution of the increasingly convoluted and confusing powers and competences of the Commission, and possibly of the Union itself.	de
Experience in other sectors where observatories have been set up also shows that, in addition to creating jobs of dubious value, these jobs are of no particular use. I therefore urge the Commission to exercise its control functions directly and personally and to work to ensure the positive progress of the LEADER+ programmes. This also involves, among other things, the evaluation and dissemination of the results, as has already been done so far. Mr President, most of the borders that have divided Europe for centuries were drawn artificially, dividing single geographical areas and inducing strong disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion. Our internal borders, or what remains of them, are no longer a cause of war today but continue to produce economic backwardness, social barriers and cultural incommunicability between the peoples of Europe. The Community institutions have a duty to ensure that these scars left by the borders become a memory, since they are in contradiction with the spirit of European unity. The economic and social cohesion that we defend manifests itself, within the framework of the INTERREG initiative, in the form of territorial cohesion and integration of the border areas and peripheral areas of our continent. From the outset, INTERREG has been the seed of a genuine Community policy on spatial planning, as well as a truly polycentric conception of European space. While Parliament supports this initiative, it only regrets that we are being asked to adopt a resolution on the subject before we have even been able to examine the evaluation carried out on INTERREG II; on the other hand, we are aware that it is not right to further delay the implementation of this third edition of the programme, which would jeopardise the outcome of numerous projects, or the continuity of those already underway, since the success of INTERREG is undeniable, as recognised by the local, regional and national authorities that have participated in co-financed projects. Learning together, innovating, sharing projects and good practices, understanding and being tolerant of each other: these are some of the lessons that this initiative has to offer to those who participate. A series of interesting issues revolve around the initiative: the observatory, the principle of concentration, etc. For my part, I would like to focus on the issue of management bodies. I believe it is necessary to identify common, interregional and transnational management bodies, in which all local and regional authorities, as well as economic and social actors, actively participate. Cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border must no longer be repeated. A cross-border culture must be created, but this requires the ability to innovate in administrative cooperation, the ability to imagine how to overcome existing barriers and the difficulties represented by the different levels of competences foreseen in each Member State, in each region and in each municipality. It is not acceptable that a given project cannot be implemented solely because of communication difficulties. During the discussion in committee, we also noted the difficulty of coordinating INTERREG with other annual or biennial financial instruments, such as MEDA, TACIS or PHARE. The motion for a resolution of this Parliament paid great attention to these difficulties, offering the European Commission useful ideas for overcoming them and establishing reasonable deadlines for implementing the necessary changes.	it
"I thank the President, Ms. Fontaine, for expressing her position yesterday, denying the involvement of this Assembly. In that statement, Mr. President, in addition to discrediting the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), Eusko Alkartasuna, and the democratic government of the Basque Country by calling them Nazis, which have an attitude that in another case, Ireland, even deserved the Nobel Prize, they insult representatives of European citizens—as is my case: I represent a segment of Galician society, saying that we are more dangerous than Nazism—and they insult unequivocally democratic organizations with decades of history, in an unacceptable madness that I take the liberty of condemning at this moment. I request, in any case, that our words be heard, because the European Parliament cannot be so implicated in a madness that I clearly describe as unacceptable. Thank you, Mr. Nogueira, for your clarification. I remind you that questions about the Minutes should be referred to the Minutes. In any case, for those colleagues who are unaware of the President's position, I will read the official statement, and it will also be recorded in today's Minutes: ""On 17 February, Ms. Nicole Fontaine, President of the European Parliament, received, at their request, representatives of the Ermua Forum. The Spanish Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament were represented. At the end of this meeting, the representatives of the Forum sent her a document entitled the ""Strasbourg Declaration,"" the terms of which the President can in no way endorse. Strasbourg, 17 February."" Therefore, I believe that the matter is completely settled. Mr. President, I request a correction in the Minutes regarding the vote on Amendment 5 to the Swoboda Report. Please note that Mr. Michel Raymond, Mr. Jean Saint-Josse, and I voted against this amendment. It is noted and will be recorded in the Minutes. Mr. President, not for the record, but for a communication we have before us today, namely, that the Conference of Presidents scheduled for February 23 has been canceled. We must reflect on whether this type of event should continue to be held in this manner. I have the feeling that it is nothing more than a mechanical part of the performance of our duties. What we hear there we could easily read about in the newspapers the next day. And when something else comes up, I don't think it's right that the agendas of the various committees, already excessively busy, should always be shortened because of the show we put on. Therefore, let us consider whether we should not do away with these conferences altogether. Mr. Bösch, I take note of your observation, but, obviously, the holding of this type of Conference of Presidents open to all Members stems from a request from Members, in order to be able to participate in some of them. We should certainly be more selective. In any case, the Bureau will consider your suggestion. (The Minutes are approved.) VOTES Mr. President, we request that the last sentence of Amendment 2, which reads: ""Also invites Member States to promote tourism for older adults,"" be moved forward and included in paragraph 25, specifically aimed at social tourism, at the end of the sentence ""tourism for organized social groups."""	es
The fundamental point of discussion with the Council will obviously be the allocation that LIFE III must be provided with. The common position provides for a financial envelope of 613 million euros for the period 2000-2004, which is insufficient. The Liberal Group is in favour of increasing this amount to 850 million euros. We therefore support Mrs Lienemann's amendment, which notes that the LIFE allocation was not increased during the last enlargement of the Union, let alone the next wave of new arrivals. The sums we are requesting do not constitute a Himalaya of useless expenditure. On the contrary, they are still very modest compared to the needs to be covered. A drop in the ocean, I would say, compared to Europe's structural policies. The environment remains a very poor relation of the European budget, even though it constitutes, above all, an investment. Investment in natural resources, of course, but also in employment, since it has been shown that an active environmental policy creates new jobs, as evidenced in particular by the very great success of LIFE: success with NGOs, businesses, local authorities, third countries. Nearly a third of the 8,500 applications received met the required conditions and approximately 1,300 projects were able to be co-financed between 1992 and 1998. A success that Parliament wants to see, intends to see perpetuated, which is why we also support Amendment 14 outlining the fourth stage of the LIFE project. When it comes to the environment, investment and ambition are, and must be, long-term. The future of future generations depends on this. Mr President, Commissioner, I will no doubt repeat what my colleagues have been saying, but I believe that, for the Council, it is a matter of repeating again and again what we think of LIFE. Therefore, I will also say – as the rapporteur has already done very well – that LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the establishment and implementation of the European Union's environmental policy. This mechanism is absolutely essential because it stimulates truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are taken up and amplified by the Member States. This financial instrument is, moreover, deliberately democratic in being accessible to both governmental organisations and NGOs. That is why, dear colleagues, I will ask you not to vote for the amendments which have completely failed to understand the spirit of LIFE. Indeed, through associations, LIFE can be used directly by European citizens, and for the benefit of actions of general interest. Several million - I did say millions - of NGO members recognise in LIFE the Union's desire to build an ambitious policy in favour of natural heritage. LIFE is, moreover, the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe, to which the Member States have committed themselves, in accordance with the Community directives on the habitats of rare and threatened fauna and flora and on migratory birds, and which allows the establishment of protection for sites of high biological value in our States.	fr
We must ensure that what we do is meaningful. We must not create confusion or jurisdictional conflicts over rights, which would be highly detrimental to freedom, justice, and security. In short, we must establish and observe the highest possible common standards and find ways to safeguard them. But we must also always bear subsidiarity in mind. Like everyone in this House, I aspire to this area of freedom, justice, and security, but I do not want it to lead to excessive centralization, chaos, and confusion. Madam President, Honourable Members, several questions have been asked about the Portuguese Presidency in previous speeches. The President of Parliament made us feel that we do not have much time, which is why my colleague from the Ministry of Justice and I propose to answer objectively all the questions that have been asked here. We will do so at the parliamentary committee meeting we will be attending next week. (Prolonged applause) Thank you very much, Minister. The debate is closed. Mr President, I welcome the Council's oral and written response. Its effectiveness has truly been remarkable. I will spare a few seconds because I would like to propose that the Council continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. There we will have the opportunity to comment on these proposals and to express our concerns to the Commission. I personally welcome some of the responses received, for example, those concerning such sensitive subjects as Schengen or the Europol Convention, which we hope will be reviewed, and I welcome what the Minister of Justice said, namely that we will try to submit to the jurisdiction of the judiciary. I hope the same will be true regarding parliamentary scrutiny. Representatives of the Council, we will be submitting a motion for a resolution to this House in a month's time. I am sure that, with the good humour you have shown today, the first thing you will do, in this new climate of mutual understanding, will be to consider the motion for a resolution that we will submit to you. Question Time (Council) The next item is Question Time to the Council (B5-0003/2000). Question No. 1 of (H-0780/99): Subject: Construction of a nuclear power plant in a region of Turkey with high seismic activity The two recent earthquakes in Turkey, measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, have given rise to grave concern at Turkey's stated intention to build expensive nuclear reactors at Akuyu, at a time when excess energy from the Ataturk dams is being exported to third countries and the EU is using its own resources to help repair the damage caused by the earthquakes. This suggests that Turkey's nuclear programme, which ignores the dangers to the inhabitants and ecosystems of the country and the region as a whole, is a front for a strategy adopted by the Turkish politico-military authorities to acquire nuclear technology that will enable them to develop nuclear weapons, since they are seeking to acquire the same reactors, of Canadian origin, that India and Pakistan possess.	fr
"Madam President, today the Commission presents its strategic objectives for the five-year period 2000-2005 in the form of an extremely generic document from which all the sensitive points have been removed to avoid offending certain sensibilities too much. And so in the first part on the new forms of European government one obviously never reads the words federalism or superstate, while this is precisely what is looming on the horizon when one speaks of a strong European institution, which decentralises only ordinary executive activities and which carries forward a collective vision in a not better clarified whole, in which national governments and parliaments are put in a cauldron with regional and even local administrations, as well as with civil society, all defined, without a minimum hierarchical structure, and I quote ""participants in European policies"". These ambiguities hide numerous misunderstandings, first of all about our values. In fact, to be democratic it is not enough to appeal to democracy. In concrete terms, it is above all necessary to accept that citizens are free to decide at the level that can best guarantee objective conditions for a close, fair and transparent democratic debate, that is, mainly at the national level. Instead, the entire communication from the Commission is built precisely on the opposite postulate, according to which, under the pretext of better defending peoples, their margin for autonomous choice should be increasingly limited through new regulations, new integrated policies and new binding legal structures, such as the draft Charter, wrongly defined as the Charter of fundamental rights. And I stress ""wrongly"" because in reality it will end up reducing these rights. We in the Union for a Europe of Nations group cultivate completely different principles: we intend to defend European countries, but also to respect the choice of peoples. This is not at all about squaring the circle: we must free ourselves from the obsolete federalist schemes of those who continue to draw inspiration from the memoirs of Jean Monnet for any idea on the European theme. On the contrary, we must open the European institutions to the modern world, inventing a dynamic of variable geometry that respects nations. This is the great idea about the new government that we would have liked to have seen in your communication, Mr President. Unfortunately, however, it was not there. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, you claim to be building a new Europe, but unfortunately you lack an essential requirement: trust. In fact, you cannot win the trust of millions of Europeans by not being worthy of it. And how could you be worthy of it after the mad cow scandal, after the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption? You are responsible for the millions of unemployed, the millions of poor, for the precariousness and growing poverty caused by your free-trade and liberal policies to the bitter end, for the forced march towards the single currency. You wanted and organised the elimination of internal borders, thus leaving Europe at the mercy of the explosion of crime and insecurity, as well as the spread of uncontrolled immigration. Today you propose to give all decision-making power to a handful of officials, making the States, local administrations and non-governmental organizations, all of which are accumulated in the subjection to Brussels, mere executors of decisions imposed from above."	it
"The new Commission now recognises the need for such independence for ex post checks, so isn't it logical that it should also apply to preliminary checks? I believe that tomorrow's vote should decisively reiterate this need, already expressed by my colleague Theato, which I fully share. Mr President, a few years ago the previous Commission tried to come to terms with the old, rigid structures. This led to strikes and smear campaigns by narrow-minded unions, after which the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a ""soft"" compromise. This was the stupidity of the old Commission and Parliament was of no help at the time. Reading the chapter on personnel policy in the Van Hulten report, I fear that Parliament will once again fail to live up to expectations on the key points, making only weak speeches devoid of any substance. There are too many rights, too many rules and too little room for management. The backbone and teeth are missing. Where is the beef? And I say it to you too, Commissioner: Please, deliver the beef even if it is British. President Prodi promised a revolution and you too have spoken strongly and positively, but now be careful not to give in on the fundamental points, the most delicate ones! Bring order to the jungle of staff funding! Hold firm on the need for mobility, not as a right, as the report says, but as a management tool! Make sure that training also becomes a management tool! Do not accept the report's request that temporary agents should be appointed to permanent posts! It is the posts that should eventually be made permanent, and not necessarily the current temporary agents who should become permanent officials. Finally, Mr President, as a member of the Bureau until six months ago, I would like to invite you to deal with this issue in the Bureau, so that here in Parliament, in our administration, we at least meet the requirements that we impose on others. We have not done so so far, and you must help to change things. Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Van Hulten for his report, which I voted in favour of. However, I would like to highlight the points on which I disagree. I do not agree with the paragraphs relating to Parliament. This report is about the Commission, and Parliament is a separate issue. There is therefore no need to also talk about Parliament in the debate on the Commission. There is also the issue of tax-free goods. This was an argument used against the Commission by the duty-free lobby, which was upset that the Commission had abolished duty-free at airports. This is also an issue that should not be included in the report. A large part of the report deals with financial control, and that is understandable given that it comes from the Committee on Budgetary Control. However, we must not give the impression that a large part of Community resources is being put at risk by mismanagement by the European Commission."	it
I am pleased with the draft compromise resolution, which we have agreed on together with the GUE, Green, Liberal, and PSE groups, calling on the Commission to submit a report to Parliament within six months on the feasibility of this tax and also to examine financial coercive measures and sanctions against countries that encourage tax evasion or operate tax havens. It is often argued that such a tax would be circumvented, but this is true of any tax, and if this argument were accepted, there would be no taxes at all today. Furthermore, the draft resolution calls for a position paper to be drawn up by the Commission and the Council before the next annual meeting of the IMF. I believe that the European Union must take the initiative here; furthermore, it must propose this initiative to the G7 countries, as the draft resolution calls for, since this is primarily a political issue. If the Union were to take the initiative, it would have a certain impetus, because this debate is taking place everywhere, including in the United States and Japan, and because there is a growing trend throughout the world for the world to be run not by stockbrokers, but by citizens, their parliaments, their governments, and their democratic institutions. I believe that Europe must assume its responsibilities within the framework of this new international arrangement, and I am extremely pleased that this issue is on the agenda for European construction today, in this debate and through this draft resolution. Madam President, I do not have much to say in advance on this subject. The Council has not yet considered Professor Tobin's proposal for a tax on capital movements. This is an innovative initiative which, as we know, has met with support in various sectors throughout the world and among several European political groupings, but so far the Commission has put forward no proposal or initiative on the matter. Since the Commission is responsible for any initiative, the Council can only then take a position on this matter. (NL) Madam President, the Tobin tax is intended to be levied on revenue from very short-term foreign exchange transactions. Such transactions, it is argued, have little connection with real economic data. This was also emphasized by Mr Désir just now. Proponents such as Mr Désir therefore believe that an internationally introduced Tobin tax would, in principle, help curb speculative currency transactions and thus also exchange rate fluctuations, which would lead to higher economic wealth. Given the considerable scale of short-term capital movements, even a very low nominal Tobin tax would generate considerable tax revenue. The growing interest in the Tobin tax and other international sources of finance in the mid-1990s was in fact based on non-economic motives: the revenue that the tax would generate to finance international public programs at a time when demand for such finance was growing rapidly and capital was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. The Commission has recently noted renewed interest in a global tax such as the Tobin tax, which is intended to achieve what could be called a socially acceptable globalisation.	de
However, there is one point of contention. Given the scope of the directive, it may be a minor issue, but it is the focus of the discussion. It concerns the issue of recycling costs. We maintain a fundamentally different position from that expressed in the Council debates last year. There, the issues of free recycling for the last owner and financing were mixed up, and the free nature of recycling for the last owner was questioned. In this Parliament, we unequivocally agreed in February last year—and we Social Democrats support it—that free recycling for the last owner is beyond question! But who pays for the vehicles that must be disposed of? It is clear to us that, with regard to new vehicles, it must be the manufacturer, as this incentivizes the manufacturer to design and build vehicles suitable for recycling. But what about vehicles already on the road? An example: in Great Britain, if Rover were responsible for all end-of-life vehicles, it would be responsible for 5.8 million vehicles in the European Union and would have to immediately set aside €250 million in reserves to cover recycling costs, while a Korean manufacturer that builds similar vehicles has to set aside, as a Deutsche Bank representative said, a paltry amount. These are distortions of competition that have nothing to do with environmental protection, but only affect the investment capacity and jobs of those who build cars in Europe. We therefore propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles, thus ensuring compliance with the cost-free principle. I understand that colleagues from other countries where car manufacturers are not built say that manufacturers should pay all the costs, and the problem of distortions of competition with funds is of no interest to us! But I ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than two million people who build vehicles in Europe and earn their living from it, so that these jobs can be guaranteed in the future. I am in favor of imposing strict environmental requirements, as you know from the vehicle oil program and the debate on maximum exhaust emission values. But, in my opinion, these requirements must be the same for everyone! Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, we need this directive. First, because it clearly sets out the environmental objectives. Second, because it can encourage recycling, and that is important. Third, because it constitutes a clear procedure for tackling heavy metal pollution. This is also an important aspect. The directive provides a European framework, also for countries that already have a system in place and that wish to continue working with it. Therefore, we must maintain recycling rates first and foremost, because this naturally encourages technological innovation, in order to find a solution for recycling materials that we still don't quite know what to do with.	es
First, Parliament must have unhindered access to all Commission documents. On the other hand, we must quickly find an internal arrangement to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents. In connection with the gathering of information, I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that we are concerned about the draft plans for public access to documents. If the concept is correct, it represents a huge step backwards compared to today. It must no longer be the case that financially powerful organizations can obtain information through their representatives in Brussels, while ordinary citizens cannot. It is also unacceptable for a public institution to own copyright on public documents. Furthermore, the duties of all European civil servants must be defined in principle so that officials who feel guilty about their actions can more easily defend themselves against assignments that violate ethical principles or legal provisions. If the Court of Auditors signals that a problem occurs not one but two years in a row, management must be held accountable, and this must also be reflected in their career planning. Finally, there is, of course, a need for better cooperation between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts. Parliament is demanding that the Commission outline its plans for reforming its external aid programmes on 31 March of this year. It is no longer acceptable that Europe, while an economic power, cannot exert political influence because, when it comes down to it, we are unable to provide effective support to areas in urgent need. We cannot accept that the Commission completed a hospital in 1996 which, to this day, does not have a single patient. Since 1996, discharge has gained political significance. It is one of the most powerful instruments of power at Parliament's disposal and must therefore be used judiciously. In all likelihood, therefore, we will grant discharge tomorrow. However, we will not relinquish this weapon without laying a time bomb. Discharge for 1999 will not be granted until the financial irregularities identified by the Court of Auditors have been resolved. This discharge report is, of course, addressed to the Commission. But the European Parliament must also put its internal affairs in order. As long as we do not have a statute, we will lack credibility as a driving force behind the Union's reform package. The reform of the EU institutions is a fundamental prerequisite for the further construction of Europe. Only an open and democratic Europe can be effective and fair. All institutions must now work together to create this Europe. Mr President, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has decided to take the first step and draw up a report on the discharge for the 1997 financial year, even though we had no specific mandate to do so. We did this because we believed that we should begin in this Parliament in the same way that we intend to proceed in the future: by ensuring that European taxpayers' money is in good hands. During the preparation of this report, it became clear that there are serious problems in the areas of expenditure that fall within our budget.	de
"It therefore seemed essential to fill this gap in order to achieve a high and uniform level of training for safety advisers, but also to avoid disparities in training costs and, consequently, an impact on competition between companies in the Member States. The Commission's proposal aims to ensure uniform training for safety advisers. It defines the minimum content of examinations and defines the tasks of the competent authority as well as the requirements to be met by the examining bodies. Our Parliament supported this text. However, it tabled several amendments, most of which were included in the Council's common position, particularly with regard to the need to draw up a questionnaire and declarations concerning the authorization of certain documents within the framework of ""the specifications of the examination arrangements proposed by the examining body"". I also support postponing the date of application of these provisions to three months after the entry into force of the directive for the sake of realism. I will conclude by stressing that harmonising the professional qualifications of these advisers will help to improve the quality of service in the interest of users, and to minimise the risk of accidents that could lead to environmental damage and serious damage that could affect the physical well-being of anyone who might come into contact with dangerous goods. Koch report (A5-0104/1999) Last October, I spoke about the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail. The comments I will make today are not far removed from those I made at the time. They can be summed up as follows: I regret that, in an area as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods, we are always putting off adopting harmonised standards to the detriment of human safety and the environment. I would point out that a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning the transport of dangerous goods by road entered into force on 1 January 1997. This directive included a number of transitional provisions valid until 1 January 1999. It was from that date that we should have taken a position on a proposal from the European Commission aimed at ending these derogations. According to the current procedure, it is the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) that proposes standards in this area, which are then included in the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (better known by its acronym ADR), which applies throughout Europe and whose provisions serve as the basis for the legislation applicable in the EU. CEN was unable to complete its work within the allotted time. Therefore, the Commission proposal we are discussing today is intended to amend the directive to address these problems in the short term, not to end the transitional arrangements, as should have been the case! This is exactly what happened with the transport of these goods by rail, with one difference: a deadline had been set."	fr
"In this case, the Commission proposes obtaining specific information from the Irish authorities on the current status of compensatory measures and on potential problems associated with the mechanical removal of sable grass. We do not consider it appropriate at this stage to propose a suspension of funding under the Structural Funds. Mr President, the case raised by Mrs McKenna is unfortunately not an isolated incident. There are other examples of EU funds being used in a way that has a negative impact on protected areas established for scientific reasons. Can the Commission imagine instructing all Member States that, where they find a breach of European environmental directives or improper environmental assessments, not only should current funding be suspended but any funding already granted should be withdrawn or, in other words, the funds should be reclaimed from the Member States. This is the only way to prevent similar actions in the future. (SV) This is an extremely important question. As you, as Members of the European Parliament, will no doubt be aware, a joint letter was written last year by our predecessors in the Commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies, addressing the relationship between Structural Funds, funding from the Structural Funds, and protection under the FloraFaunaHabitat Directive. The message of this joint letter remains valid. We cannot distribute funds with one hand and, with the other, take countries to court, where they may be fined, so that it is important that there is agreement on this. Of course, difficult judgment calls can arise. However, in my opinion, the most important effect is that countries think more carefully and, above all, submit their lists of Natura 2000 sites, so that we have the opportunity for proper monitoring and control. Ireland, as well as other Member States, still has shortcomings in this regard, but we hope that this pressure will soon produce results. Let me reiterate that the content of the above-mentioned letter is still valid. According to the Rules of Procedure, this is not possible. You must speak outside the Chamber, Madam. Questions to Mr Barnier: Question No. 44 by (H-0020/00): Subject: Partnership and the third CSF for Greece. Compared with the previous regulation, the new Regulation 1260/1999 on the Structural Funds places particular emphasis on strengthening partnership and provides for the participation of autonomous self-governing bodies at regional and local level, as well as the other competent public authorities, the social partners, and any other relevant competent body, not only in the preparation but also in the financing, monitoring, and evaluation of assistance. However, according to repeated complaints from local government bodies, the procedures for the new CSF for Greece have remained unchanged and do nothing to enhance the role of ""partners."" Has the Greek State made any changes to the procedures to expand the partnership, particularly with regard to local authorities and other representative bodies? What is the enhanced role of local authorities in the preparation and management of the third CSF, and what measures has the Commission taken to ensure greater involvement of the partners in all procedures under the new CSF?"	de
"However, before the debates begin or during breaks in the sitting, could it not be opened so that we can enjoy, free of charge, that magnificent spectacle that appears to be behind you? I fully understand that it should be the richness of our debates that illuminates our Chamber; but we would benefit if sunlight could occasionally enter to illuminate our ""bubble"" of democracy. I think it would be very positive if the possibility of opening this curtain were examined. Thank you very much, Mr. Onesta. I welcome any suggestions that would give a more human dimension to our sitting chamber. I would like to make the following proposal. For the time being, we can continue the sitting by leaving the room as it is. In the meantime, I will send for information on whether the change poses any technical problems. If not, we will conduct a half-hour test to see what happens when the President sits against the light. UCITS. (SV) Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my hope is that today Parliament is ready to take the decision to expand and strengthen the financial market in Europe. As a new Member of the European Parliament, I have found it very interesting and instructive to be responsible for this important issue. I would especially like to thank my colleagues for their willingness to reach agreements, the President and the Chamber for their sensitivity to the complexity of this matter, the Commission—especially the Commissioner—and the Council for our good relations, and also the Committee Secretariat for its generous work. There was great unanimity in the Committee, except on one point, on which I hope we will also agree. The issue of UCITS seems complicated, fraught with political and technical risks. I believe there are those who do not even know what UCITS means. However, let me state that this issue truly concerns European citizens, that is, how their savings are managed, the choices available to them, how competition between countries works in the area of savings, investors' demands for security, and their ability to save wisely for old age. The aim is to balance the demands for liberalization to improve the market and achieve greater benefits with investor protection and security. During the 1980s, most European markets underwent considerable liberalization. This was a consequence of the rapid development of national securities markets, especially, for several years. Mutual funds then became an alternative to bank savings. In my own country, more than 60 percent of Swedes invest in various funds. Saving in funds provides security, which is based on the broad base of their investments. The capital and securities markets have continued to develop. The current UCITS directive has become outdated. New types of funds have been introduced in some member countries, which cannot be offered in others."	es
Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it cannot be repeated often enough and intensely enough that what the Council has agreed as the agenda for the next Intergovernmental Conference is politically absolutely unacceptable, and I would add, shameful. We find ourselves in a historic situation in which we are negotiating with 12 Member States or are about to begin negotiations, and in a situation in which the joint growth of Europe can become a reality in the foreseeable future. But how can the Union be enlarged if things are not done properly now, that is, before enlargement? That is why our political group is in favor of the Intergovernmental Conference. We consider it essential and urgent, and we hope that it will truly produce results that will make an early enlargement of the European Union possible. Mr. President of the Council, my political group has noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is not satisfied with the current situation. Therefore, rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will work to ensure that the Union finally fulfills its mission. This is nothing less than the future of Europe, and above all, a Europe that citizens understand as their own, because they can participate in its formation, and because the concerns, problems, and issues that truly move them are taken seriously by politics. Politics behind closed doors, deliberations in silent cliques—all this must end once and for all. Therefore, transparency is absolutely necessary. I believe that, as Presidency of the Council, you should ensure that the train does not continue to roll as it has until now and that people are not left behind on the platforms as if they were illiterate in Treaty matters. We believe it is essential not only to ensure that everything is done to thoroughly inform citizens about the progress and results of the Intergovernmental Conference, but also that they must be included much more intensively in the entire reform process. We also believe that the politicians who make the decisions must finally do something and, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, ask the citizens through referendums how their Europe should develop further. This would truly give us a Europe of citizens and a completely new quality in the democratic legitimacy of the Union. I will address another central democratic issue. As a member of the Assembly that has just begun its work with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I want to state clearly that a solemn declaration of the Charter is not enough for me and my political group. What will citizens say if they are solemnly announced certain rights but cannot claim them individually through the courts? No, I believe this would further deepen the Union's credibility crisis.	es
Madam Deputy, I ask you all - please do not take this as a warning - to only address strictly Community issues. I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are several points of view... I say to the Commissioner that Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government. You can answer the question. Madam Deputy, as I heard that you were vocal, I hope that your voice was strong enough to be heard in Madrid, but I understood that what you were saying was not addressed directly to me. I have given you my answer. I am concerned that the structural funds, and in particular those under Objective 1, are allocated where they are needed. We have criteria that apply and we know here, as a guide, what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive. The fact remains - I am not hiding, but I am obliged to always refer to the general regulation - that I must discuss with the national authorities of each country and with the government of each country. It is their responsibility to make the distribution as objectively and fairly as possible. I need to know anyway, which is why I told you that I could not reply today. As I do not have the answer, I wrote to the Minister of Economy and Finance on 14 December. Now, the time is coming when I will become impatient at not having received a reply and I will pass it on to you when I have received it. I regret that the Commissioner has embarked, once again, on an imaginative, and this time fascinating, intervention. In Spain - I would like to remind you all - the problem is not that we are in an election period, it is that there are only 25 days left before the elections. The Commissioner will be pleased to know that these elections will take place in 25 days because, after that, he will probably no longer be asked these types of questions. Yes, I think it is important to say that Andalusia will receive 50% more under the Community framework and that Spain also has a record in the implementation of structural funds, which means that distribution is carried out in strict compliance with the implementing regulations and is decentralized through regional development plans and the various Community support frameworks. Finally, I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question: do you think the implementing regulations for the structural funds should be changed, or do you find the current distribution criteria acceptable? I find this debate fascinating. I understand that it has a dimension that is not exclusively Community-based. That said, we must accept the fact that there are permanent elections in all the countries of the Union. What pleases me is that, fundamentally, the structural funds are the subject of discussions in Greece and Spain. Earlier, here, we were talking about citizen debates, public debates.	fr
Unfortunately, more than a year after the proposal was presented, the other body of legislative power, the Council, has not yet started to deal with it. I hope that this debate will serve to remind the Member States of the importance and urgency of this initiative. We have recently learned from the Portuguese Presidency that a serious discussion on this proposal is about to begin. The French Presidency, which is about to replace the Portuguese Presidency, also seems willing to give this dossier the priority it deserves. The Commission sincerely hopes that Parliament and the Council will rapidly complete this important dossier, which in our view is the most effective response to the concerns raised by cases such as those discussed here today. As regards transnational worker participation, there is some evidence that in at least one case companies have breached the transnational information and consultation agreements they had concluded with their workforce at European level, or at least it is possible that they have exploited some ambiguities in the current legal and contractual framework. The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to follow up on this. However, I would like to reassure those who fear that their rights in this area have been infringed that the appropriate enforcement and redress tools are available to them, in particular through the competent national courts. The Commission is aware of your request for an immediate review of the European Works Councils Directive. As stated in the report that we will adopt in the coming weeks, we recognise that the Directive does have some loopholes. However, my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, has already stressed on other occasions that other considerations will have to be taken into account when deciding on a possible immediate review of the Directive. Firstly, any review of the Directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless we wish to suspend the application of the fundamental principle of respect for the autonomy of the parties involved in negotiations. Secondly, an immediate revision would significantly complicate the situation for the other open dossiers in this field, such as the European company statutes and the proposal for consultation and information at national level. The successful conclusion of these dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the European Works Councils Directive and even provide, to some extent, a solution to the problems identified. That is why, in this context, we feel it is more appropriate to proceed with the revision of the European Works Councils Directive only after these two dossiers have been concluded, and after having more carefully assessed the application of the Directive. Our action is not limited to the legislative field. In order to encourage and support dialogue as a key element in successfully adapting to change, the Commission is also developing the recommendations of the Lillehammer report, by preparing a European observatory on industrial change. We are also working on another idea offered by that group of experts, namely the report on managing change. Finally, I would like to address some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution presented to Parliament.	it
"I would like to see some changes in the Assembly, especially after the conclusion of the new Convention in May. There must be greater equality between the ACP partners and the European members and I want to get rid of the ""them and us"" syndrome. First, I would like to see a Joint Parliamentary Assembly of elected members from the ACP countries and not of ambassadors or government ministers present as delegates. I think that is the new Convention. Second, the new Convention provides for regional meetings in the six areas concerned, which would allow us to be more specific in our work. The regional assemblies should send reports to the Joint Assembly. We had a regional discussion in Nassau in the Caribbean and it was a very productive experience. We will also have another in Abuja in West Africa. I want the Assembly to stop being just a forum for discussions and become a laboratory for improving the conditions of all people in developing countries. I want civil society to be given a greater voice. But to do so, we need to put an end to the problem of corruption, and we need to tackle it with the utmost determination. We need to reward those nations that strive to uphold the standards of good governance. We need to be equally firm with those that are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow for the pluralistic governments we demand. I am very pleased with the outcome in Zimbabwe. European taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being used for fraudulent purposes. A new wind of change must blow across Africa and new standards must be set and respected. The Joint Assembly must play a leading role in monitoring compliance with the principles of good governance, human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission. I believe that as equal partners the ACP and EU elected delegates are up to the task and I ask you to approve the report. Mr President, I would first like to congratulate Mrs Corrie on an excellent and comprehensive report. Respect for human rights and the fight against poverty must be the basis of any development policy considerations. The reduction in resources in the area of development aid in many Member States and in the European Union is in stark contrast to the intention to fight poverty. As regards the crucial issue of funding, with a view to the future, the Joint Assembly must be provided with additional resources to be used to send electoral observers at the request of the ACP countries. In future, the European Union, when defining development projects, must, on the one hand, focus on several fronts and, on the other, better coordinate its position with the individual States, in order to work more efficiently and use funds more effectively. We can cite as an example the area of education, which deserves and needs special promotion in the future in the ACP countries. The rapid development of the potential of education and technology on the Internet has revealed the existence of entirely new tools for bringing developing countries, with their still modest means, closer to globality, but not to globalization."	it
"The European Parliament certainly cannot be blamed for this failure. It is the governments of the Member States that have so severely restricted the scope for action. This presents the European Parliament with an almost insurmountable task. We should accept the idea that every available opportunity must be seized to achieve better legal assistance. Paradoxically, I could say: It would be best if we spoke as little as possible about this report. The more we make it clear that these are only very small steps, the more organized crime rubs its hands together, and the more clearly the blatant disproportion between organized crime and the acute lack of judicial cooperation becomes apparent. I urgently appeal to the Council of Ministers to finally acknowledge reality. Above all, it should recognize that crime is inversely proportional to codification. The goal is to provide judicial authorities – namely judges and prosecutors, but also the citizens concerned – with tools to combat crime without undermining fundamental rights of defense and general principles of human rights. Otherwise, we will only be combating the symptoms, not the causes. I therefore primarily advocate for the further harmonization of criminal law in the Member States of the European Union. In my opinion, this is the only way to combat crime in a cross-border and targeted manner. However, as long as this harmonization is still pending, we must be consistent in enabling legal assistance. To this end, I submitted an amendment stating that legal assistance may only be provided if the authorities initiate criminal prosecution for acts that are punishable under the domestic law of the requesting party and that of the requested Member State. Incidentally, the content of my amendment is reflected in Amendment 43, which also sets this cumulative condition. This condition is essential because, in my opinion, the principle of legality in criminal law, ""nulla poena sine lege,"" must be respected. Consequently, any request for mutual legal assistance concerning an act that is hypothetically not punishable in the requested Member State is contrary to this principle of legality and, consequently, also to the fundamental principles of law in the requested Member State. It is therefore extremely important that this cumulative condition be adopted. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that, in my opinion, Mr Di Pietro has done an excellent job. He has presented a report that, given the limited options available, offers every conceivable guarantee for the protection of individual human rights and fundamental freedoms. If we want to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we must make greater efforts towards judicial cooperation. Mr President, my group welcomes the drafting of a convention to regulate the daily practice of mutual legal assistance in criminal matters. The regulation is intended to establish the rights and obligations of states or citizens among themselves, or in the relationship between citizens and the state. The current draft is complex: It deals with agreements between member states, but also has far-reaching consequences for the relationship between citizens and state authorities."	de
This is the position adopted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and it is an element that must naturally be included in our future analysis. There is some hope for the third round of negotiations, given the proposed plans being prepared, involving representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom, particularly in the areas of security and constitutional structure. These plans are expected to be presented at that round through the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. This will take place in a context already following the elections in the north of the island, scheduled for April 18. Furthermore, the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union, following the example of previous Presidencies, has decided to appoint a representative to liaise with the various stakeholders on this matter. The representative has already contacted them and, in close collaboration with the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, has followed the work of several rounds. In particular, we intend for the European Union to maintain a permanently active stance in this regard, all the more so given that Cyprus is, obviously, a candidate for European Union accession with a fairly advanced negotiation process, which naturally raises some hopes and determines that the European Union will play a significant role in this context. The approach we have been following in this debate and our participation in it has essentially consisted of taking advantage of a certain climate of easing tensions created by the conviction, commonly shared, it seems to us, that further negotiations are necessary and that the continuation of the negotiations and their continued pace are also, in themselves, elements of hope for the conclusion of a final solution. There is, moreover, another important element, already mentioned at the beginning of my statement, related to Turkey's commitment to contribute to the preparation of the north of the island for accession. We believe that we should not only read the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council with some care and attention, but we should also monitor the Turkish authorities' willingness to contribute to resolving this issue. I myself was in Ankara, where I had the opportunity to speak with Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit on this matter, and, although we are aware of the difficulties, the specific sensitivity, and the very idiosyncrasies of the Turkish approach to this issue, I believe that a window of opportunity is opening that cannot be missed. To achieve this, several factors must be combined, one of which—and it is worth noting—has to do with the very dynamics of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union. This is an essential element for the future of this issue. On the other hand, we believe it is important—also in relation to the way the European Union addresses the core of this issue—to encourage the exchange of information between the Commission and the Cypriots in the north of the island, without this implying—it should be made clear—any kind of official recognition.	es
"When the United States landed in Somalia, from which it had to shamefully leave, it was certainly not to secure control of the oil routes, but to restore hope. ""Restore Hope"", do you remember? In short, do you not see that it is in the name of humanitarian law that the greatest atrocities are being committed today? Finally, you spoke to us about using the great means of crisis management, not to wage war of course, but to safeguard peace. But this has always been the argument of the architects of preventive wars. Can you guarantee that there will be no preventive war against other states, especially those whose elections do not support the policy decided by the other states of the Union? Mr High Representative, these are the issues on which our concerns are centered. You say you are against war, but you are certainly not the first warmonger to swear it. May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the grandiloquent principles that you have just set out to us. Mr President, the development of a European identity in defence and security obviously does not leave the three new members who joined NATO last year, namely Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, indifferent. As candidate countries for accession to the European Union, they wish to be fully involved in this important initiative from the very beginning, from now on. However, the Council, meeting at the Helsinki Summit at the end of last year, chose not to take this wish into account. Only vague promises of consultation and cooperation were made in the Finnish capital. I would therefore like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, to what extent Prague, Warsaw and Budapest are or will be involved in the definition of European military crisis management plans. The question is all the more pressing in the light of the critical attitude taken by the Polish side. In short, the Polish reservation is as follows: avoid American isolationism and European separatism. Polish Foreign Minister Bronislav Geremek logically formulated this position in a more diplomatic way, stating that the construction of a European defence identity cannot be at the expense of NATO unity. On the contrary, the European defence identity must strengthen NATO. This is a position we fully share! Minister Geremek is certainly not the only authority among the new NATO members from Central and Eastern Europe to disagree with the crucial process underway. His position was supported by the Czech Defence Minister who, in the autumn of last year, stated: ""The security of Europe is not divisible. Security cannot be limited to a small group of countries, while others are forced to passively watch or carry out decisions."" The positions expressed bring back my question to Mr Solana. Poland's demand is simple: to be involved in decisions that concern it. What is the response of the current EU Member States to this legitimate demand of the candidate countries? B (ES) Mr President, I too would like to welcome the presence of the High Representative and his willingness to answer Members' questions during this second appearance, since during his visit in November - certainly not for reasons attributable to High Representative Solana - this was not possible, although it is right to recognise that he had taken note of the questions and that he had undertaken to answer the questions put by Members as quickly as possible."	it
It would be of great benefit to Tibet, and to all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, and the Government of the People's Republic of China would also gain a great deal of credit if it responded to these attempts to initiate a dialogue. Question No. 31 of (H-0795/99): Subject: Commission's rejection of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour in the EU According to press reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal by the European Ombudsman, Mr. Jacob Söderman, to grant citizens a guarantee of good administrative behaviour in the European Union (EU). The Commission itself approved the idea of a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, but did not accept the detailed proposal made. Instead, it put forward a set of additional guidelines for better service. Is this information correct? Why is the Commission acting in this way, and how does it explain the resulting discrepancy between talk and action regarding reform of the EU administration? Does she consider this event compatible with the five-point programme agreed in September with the European Parliament, and is she prepared to present a detailed proposal for a code of good administrative conduct on which Parliament can also express its opinion? I call Mr Patten, on behalf of the Commission. It seems to me that the press reports to which the honourable Member referred are misleading and imprecise. The Commission approved at first reading in November 1999 a code of good administrative conduct for inclusion in its rules of procedure. The Commission is currently consulting its staff representatives on the document, a process that will be finalised in the coming weeks. The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading. It should be noted that the new Commission followed up immediately on the European Ombudsman's decision of 28 July 1999 in its own-initiative inquiry into the code of administrative conduct. The Commission would like to emphasise, in particular, that it took into account all the European Ombudsman's draft recommendations in drafting the code. The code will deal exclusively with relations between the Commission's administration and the public. It will be adopted by means of a legally binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The document has been drafted with full consideration of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the Office of the European Ombudsman. In accordance with the provisions contained in the Treaties, the Commission itself is responsible for drawing up its own rules. However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and ask when these directives will finally enter into force. I would point out that they date back to 1997. The information reported by the press was misleading. I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman.	fr
This is why I want to highlight some issues that I believe the Commission should have at the forefront of its attention. We count on the Commission to take into account the points related to additionality. We are unhappy that these figures appear to have been somewhat hidden within the overall figures for the United Kingdom. We count on the Commission to also ensure that funds are matched to projects. We count on this to challenge the UK Government, to ensure that the private sector, which is surely the largest target of Structural Funds spending, is involved in planning. Finally, we ask the Commission to ensure that Structural Funds money is spent transparently. There are too many things in this Parliament that are not transparent. This is an issue that will foster friendship between the Commission and Wales. Mr. President, our committee deals with these issues from very different perspectives, and, first of all, I will speak from the perspective of research. We consider it very positive that the rapporteur has incorporated into his own conclusions our committee's proposal on the need for research infrastructure in the countries covered by cohesion, by locating higher education institutions and other training centers in such a way that they provide better service to the inhabitants of less developed areas and facilitate the permanence of qualified individuals in their areas of origin. This is possible through measures adopted by public authorities, and this method of territorial distribution in the location of higher education is undoubtedly an efficient policy for smoothing development. Another issue we wished to draw attention to, particularly from the perspective of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission to have taken more account of the effects of the growth of services, e-commerce, and internet use when planning the coordination of the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds. In the past, poverty and wealth depended on the structure of economic activities. Wealthy regions used to have the greatest number of jobs in the industrial sector, but today these areas can become burdensome or even poor. In such cases, new investments must be made in the so-called IT and service sectors, as these are the sectors of the future. This aspect has not been sufficiently taken into account by the committee responsible for preparing the report, so, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, I draw the Commission's attention to this matter. Finally, as the Committee on Energy, we would have liked to see more emphasis placed on the need to subsidize renewable energy sources from the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds. This would have allowed us to increase the use of renewable energy sources by coordinating the two Funds. This would have offset the lack of financial resources for the energy program through the granting of these considerable financial aid funds. Mr. President, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Mr. Schroedter for his contribution to this issue and for explaining to colleagues that I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Mr. Flautre, who succeeded him on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill.	es
Paragraph 3: Mr. President, I believe there is a translation error in the Swedish text; it would have been amusing if the European left had expressed its concern about a possible increase in taxes on capital gains. We voted as we intended, but there was a translation error in the Swedish text, and I want to put that on record. We know that the Commission will soon reform the Common Fisheries Policy. This proposal for a Council regulation is the first in a series that will make this reform a reality. The collection and management of fisheries data is essential for the sound management of the Common Fisheries Policy. This data must be reliable, independently produced, and accepted by all stakeholders in the sector, politicians, and those responsible for implementing the CFP. The text of the proposed regulation has been amended relatively substantially in the Committee on Fisheries. All the Members of our group voted in favor of these amendments, both in committee and in plenary. Amendment 1 clarifies the text significantly. Indeed, the data collected should not be used solely for scientific purposes. Scientists must process this data and transmit it to the relevant political authorities responsible for decision-making. However, it is essential that the collection method be carried out in a scientifically justified manner. Amendment 2, for its part, modifies the Commission's initial proposal. The Commission's proposal, in fact, requires the preparation of very detailed studies, vessel by vessel and company by company. In addition to the extraordinarily high cost of this proposal, the heavy management burden could lead some administrations to use this complexity as an excuse for not providing information in a timely manner, and could provoke feelings of distrust among professionals in the sector if such heavy additional bureaucratic burdens are imposed on them. Regarding the second part of the amendment, it is important to better account for and characterize job losses in the sector. The management of a common fisheries policy, let us not forget, must include a social dimension in terms of statistical analysis. Amendment 3 allows for the addition of an important dimension: the collection of environmental data. The particularly serious effects of not taking this type of data into account can be measured, for example, by the decision banning driftnets, which is completely unjustified from an environmental point of view, as it affects one of the most selective fishing gears available. If this environmental dimension were not integrated into data management, the Commission could unilaterally prohibit the use of this or that fishing gear at will. Amendment 4 clarifies the obligation imposed on scientists to process and transmit all data to the competent authorities, including national and regional authorities, so that they can contribute to the decision-making process.	es
If Parliament wants to monitor effectively, the evidence must be available, and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to remedy this. One more word on ex post control, the DAS. The Van Hulten report also says this in part: I think it would be good if we gave numerical marks by category and by sector for the way in which the budget is implemented. The general impression at the moment is that everything is bad in the European budget. However, we have clearly observed in recent years a trend towards improvement in the agricultural sector and a deterioration in structural expenditure. Is this possible? I suggest that the Commission set a deadline for the implementation of the reforms. If we welcome new Member States, it is intolerable that there is no order in our own institution. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, thank you to my colleague, Mr Van Hulten. This is his first report to the House. This deserves congratulations, although I regret that he did not present his report in his mother tongue. Ladies and gentlemen, this report was difficult to prepare and perhaps comes too late. This is due, in my opinion, to the bickering between the two large groups sitting in the Committee on Budgetary Control. Let us be honest. The second report of the Committee of Independent Experts arrived in September. We are now four months later. In the meantime, Mr Van Hulten has been inundated with amendments, more than 100 in the first round. He went back to work and rewrote his report, taking into account a large number of suggestions, only to receive almost 100 more amendments in the second round. This explains the late presentation, I fear, of this excessively detailed and voluminous report. Furthermore, according to my information, the Commission has just approved a report on the reform of the Commission, which will be sent for consultation in the various institutions and therefore also to Parliament, I hope. Perhaps Mr Kinnock can shed some light on this this evening? Dear Mr Van Hulten, the Greens and Regionalists Group of the European Free Alliance will support the amendments in plenary tomorrow that seek to further improve this report. It makes no sense to repeat word for word in your report the many very valid recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts. If we vote against certain amendments or paragraphs tomorrow, it will certainly not be because of their content, but only to make your report a more readable summary. In any case, it must be made perfectly clear that my group fully supports the recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts. In any case, I am eagerly awaiting the document approved today by the Commission. In any case, I am eagerly awaiting the White Paper, which is due to be published in February.	fr
Mr President, we are faced with a proposal that seeks to incorporate into Community legislation an ICCAT recommendation - as has been said, from 1998 - which should be binding from June 1999 and which only reached Parliament at the end of last year. The Commission's legislative laziness on certain issues should not surprise us if it were not for the fact that we are faced with a recommendation issued by one of the major international fisheries organisations and which concerns the protection of a resource that is now seriously threatened, tuna. The Mediterranean - in particular some of its areas - is a very important breeding ground for bluefin tuna, of enormous commercial value. For this reason, ICCAT has recommended that the Adriatic be considered a closed area to fishing and has made the conditions governing the capture of age-zero specimens more stringent. As the rapporteur says, both measures are fully and extensively justified and therefore all that remains is to ask for their approval. However, I agree with Mr Gallagher who feels he has to express his frustration at the delay with which the Commission is putting its mechanisms in motion and converting recommendations into Community legislation. We are still waiting, for example, for the proposal for a regulation on the ban on imports of bluefin tuna from Honduras and Belize, a recommendation which dates back to 1996. From what I understand, it seems that last January the Directorate-General for Fisheries sent a note to the Directorate-General for Trade and that the latter has already started the preparatory work. However, four years to implement the ban on imports from countries which are known to favour flags of convenience is a completely unacceptable time limit, Commissioner. We have listened to the explanations given by the Commission to illustrate the long internal process required to transpose a recommendation and the image we have received is that of exasperating bureaucracy. As regards the only proposal that has been put forward to streamline the procedures for the legislation under discussion, which would exclude the Council and Parliament, I wish to express reservations. It is clear, however, that we must find a solution to this problem already in the context of the Commission's report on regional fisheries organisations and, in any case, as soon as possible. I do not think that anyone in this House would object to the principle of the protection of juvenile fish. In fact, it is often said that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy must be to protect and conserve the living resources of the marine environment. That is all very well. And there is no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial importance. As an amateur fisherman, I too would like to go back to the 1930s, when fishermen in the port of Scarborough in Yorkshire were catching tuna weighing up to 830 pounds - I do not know what the metric equivalent is. I therefore support the ICCAT conclusions and the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues. However, I would not like us to sit here debating and twiddling our thumbs while Rome burns. The common fisheries policy does not work. What has been said about conservation is certainly inspired by noble principles, but in reality the quota system is leading us directly to environmental catastrophe.	it
The Helsinki European Council had the courage to take some decisions and I believe that, from various points of view, they have already taken into account what I defined as a glimmer of possibility at the beginning of my initial speech. It is not by exploiting tensions that we will obtain concrete results in this negotiating phase, which is a delicate phase. It is, on the contrary, with a view to discreet work, work in support of the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in this area, that we must continue to move. The European Union has had an unequivocal position on this matter, honourable Members, and it seems pointless to me to want to give a different interpretation to any sentences that may appear in the Council's speeches or in any other position taken. In this Chamber we are not fighting for what is politically correct, we are fighting for the right choices at international level and to support the concrete and coherent positions taken by the Council over time and which the European Commission has also followed with great attention and in a pragmatic way. When, in this period, we hear about the need to involve the community of the Northern Cyprus area in some exchange of information, especially in the perspective of a future accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, we must realize that we are trying to find practical formulas that will allow us to overcome the obstacles that we encounter on the road to a political solution. This is not a matter of subterfuge, nor are we in any way trying to create, through practical solutions, a model that constitutes a recognition of a political nature. I believe that in this regard the Council of the European Union has provided clear evidence over time that this is not its position. Decisions have been taken with a great sense of responsibility on the part of the Council. The Helsinki conclusions are, in our opinion, very clear in this regard. The way in which we have dealt with the Republic of Cyprus within its process of accession to the European Union is something that the Cypriot authorities themselves recognize as extremely positive. It is useless to give or try to give a different interpretation to our intentions. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my warm thanks for this debate, in which I have felt encouraged and confident and which shows that the European Parliament largely shares the policy of the Member States and the Commission. I am happy to provide some clarifications requested. Firstly, on headings 4 and 7, the issue is very simple: in Berlin, as part of the broad Agenda 2000 package, a special heading was established for the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe which have begun a process of transformation, and for them alone, namely the infamous heading 7. Malta, Cyprus and Turkey were not covered by it. Mrs Schroedter described this as inconsistent. Perhaps she should turn to the then President of the Council, who is not far from her, and ask him why this alleged lack of consistency.	it
As for the Commission, I hope that it will be able to join in the compromise reached in Parliament and aimed above all at ensuring this balance. To underline this aspect once again - given the difficulty of the situation - Parliament has decided for now, for ease and safety, to enter the funds for the EQUAL programme in reserve, so that at a later stage it can be convinced of how the resources are being spent. I believe that this was the right choice. Parliament's position throughout this procedure is unclear and not even the regulation helps to clarify it. Precisely for this reason I believe that entering the funds in reserve was the right choice. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an incontrovertible fact that the INTERREG initiative contributes to the commitment to economic and social cohesion of the Union. However, I would like to underline the particular importance that INTERREG has in the Balkan area, where the political upheavals and war events of recent years have had a significant economic impact on the surrounding countries, and in particular on my own, Greece, the only Member State of the Union located in that tormented peninsula. For Greece, for the other countries bordering the region, Italy and Austria, but also for Europe as a whole, a social and economic restructuring of the Balkans that will bring political stability to this area is of primary importance. To date, some Balkan states have received funding under the PHARE and OBNOVA programmes, while others have not. In the new programming period, in view of enlargement and taking into account the funding provided by new regulations and financial instruments, such as ISPA and SAPARD, it appears absolutely essential to adequately coordinate the funding of the three INTERREG areas with other funding intended for third countries. We therefore welcome the relevant references included in Chapter 7 of the European Commission text on the definition of the general guidelines of INTERREG. The commitment to coordination, and therefore also to efficiency in programming, must equally concern all the various programmes, and if I make this observation it is because, in the previous period, the MEDA programme highlighted some difficulties that must now be overcome, in order to guarantee equal treatment for all third countries participating in the programme. Finally, Mr President, I would not like to fail to point out that the new definition of the cooperation zones between States did not take into account the particular geographical situation of the Mediterranean, which would have instead justified the creation of a specific zone for coastal and island areas. We therefore ask the Commission to pay particular attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation in a forthcoming review of the definition of the zones. I conclude, Mr President, by pointing out that the Union must persist in this type of initiative aimed at eliminating disparities between regions and ensuring their harmonious development. And, since today is Valentine's Day, as a former mayor of a provincial town, I propose that we all declare our love for the regions of Europe, for those that are in such great need of our love. Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, the development of rural areas can and must take into account three issues: maintaining jobs, protecting the territory and, last but not least, preserving local culture, which is of the utmost importance!	it
Under these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain demands of principle that will not prevent the big trusts from doing harm. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of tightening up the rules on port State control and classification societies. However, we must also stick to the facts. The Erika was inspected four times in the last two years. It is therefore not the number of checks but their intensity that must be ensured. In the debates of recent weeks, I have heard it said: the Member States do not have enough money for checks! I cannot accept this argument. If the Member States decide in agreement with us that 25 per cent of ships must be inspected under port State control, then they must also provide the necessary personnel! In the event of an inspection, it is not enough for the inspector to simply go on board to see if a fire extinguisher is missing; tests must also be carried out on the materials, because it is clear that the ship in question broke down due to excessive strain on the materials. Such phenomena can only be detected with very thorough checks. We must ensure that port State checks do not only cover external aspects, but also include tests on materials. Secondly, I agree with what the Commissioner has said, and I encourage her to continue along this path. If it is found that one or more classification societies have issued fake appraisals, these societies must be removed from the list of authorised societies; only with this deterrent can we prevent others from behaving in the same way. Dear Mrs Roth-Behrendt, the TÜV for vessels already exists, and it is the classification societies! There are also series of them, and you know several of them, as do our French colleagues; but we must take a good look at which societies do not meet the pre-established criteria, and these must be removed from the list. One last point: we should make it clear to Malta that, if it wants to join this Community, when it joins it will have to apply a standard in the registration and control of the flag State that truly meets the criteria we have established, because the environment is common to all, it cannot be divided! Mr President, Commissioner, the Erika sank right near me and is still there, with 20,000 tonnes of fuel that we don't know what will happen to them. It could also have sunk elsewhere. It sank there by chance, and Brittany, where I come from, certainly does not have to apologise for being a peninsula because of its geography, given that it is Brittany that often suffers shipwrecks. First of all, I think of the 26 Indian sailors who are not mentioned and who were rescued. There could have been victims in this catastrophe and maritime safety concerns above all the lives of men. They have now left but it is a miracle that they were saved. We start again like 20 years ago with Amoco, one accident on the north coast, one on the south, one on the west.	it
On the other hand, at European level, various measures could be studied to improve relations between hotels and tour operators, such as a regulation governing their relations, the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund, etc., in cooperation with representatives of both sectors. In the past, the Commission requested quantitative data on the damage suffered by businesses due to bankruptcies, in order to form an opinion from the European hotel and restaurant confederations and travel agencies, Hotrec and ECTAA, and to draw up and draft a regulation governing their relations. Since then, however, no progress has been made. It is therefore necessary, Mr President, Commissioner, to establish measures that would improve the quality and competitiveness of European tourism, but also ensure, as far as possible, the functioning of businesses. They must also aim at the rational use of natural and cultural resources, as well as tourist infrastructure, thus contributing to the sustainable and balanced development of tourism. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate Mr Viceconte and, as a Cretan living in a tourist region, I ask you to consider tourism not only as a pleasant holiday but also as a job creator for a Europe that needs them. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the recent change of attitude adopted by the Commission towards tourism has attracted the attention of those who, like me, have followed this important economic activity and its introduction into the Community world in recent years. Everyone is aware that this is fundamentally due to the close cause-and-effect relationship between tourism and employment and to the recognition by the European Union, following the conference held on this subject in 1997, of the enormous potential that tourism represents for employment. This is why the Commission communication we are debating today is timely, as is, of course, Mr Viceconte's report, which contains 34 conclusions, including 15 requests to the Commission, for which I congratulate him. In these 15 requests, the Commission is invited to adopt concrete measures and actions without neglecting the environmental aspect and cultural protection, particularly in the outermost and island regions. Four requests are addressed to the Member States, in particular the need to coordinate actions with regional authorities and to establish measures favourable to tourism SMEs, particularly in terms of taxation and access to financial instruments in order to encourage job creation in sectors that use a lot of labour, such as tourism. Finally, we must recognise that once the lack of a legal basis, to which many of us aspire in order to have a common tourism policy, has been overcome, we must be realistic and develop a strategy in this area, as the Commission, with the help of this Parliament, has emphasised regarding its relationship with employment, in which young people and women, training and quality, and the new information society must receive particular attention. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr Viceconte for his report, which helps to draw attention to a sector that is too often overlooked.	fr
It is insufficient, and I am glad that Mr. Barnier has mentioned here an idea that I very much like and that, moreover, I expressed to the press in Bordeaux, namely, the establishment of a strengthened European civil security policy. If we want the European citizenship we desire to exist, if we want this mandate, which our President, Mrs. Fontaine, has attributed as its hallmark the rapprochement of the Union and the citizens of Europe, to be effective, I believe that the urgency must be palpable for our fellow citizens. Therefore, I believe that a Eurocorps Civil Security, the establishment of genuine Blue Helmets for civil relief, present in places of difficulty, within the Union, since we currently do not have an emergency procedure, but also outside, if the need arises, in Venezuela or elsewhere, would be something we should advocate for. I therefore wish to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he will find an active ally of this idea, which I consider generous and European. Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in Europe we are relatively safe from hurricanes, compared to the frequency with which they occur in other regions of the world. Even so, the storms of the last week of December demonstrated what their consequences can be and that they can still cause us major problems. Those who traveled to Strasbourg by car or train will have seen how violent the storm was, even in Alsace. I would therefore like to express my condolences to all the citizens and regions so severely affected by the storm, and at the same time, in this House, emphasize the importance of supporting these regions and their inhabitants. We all know that other regions of Europe may be similarly affected in the future. Now it is necessary to remove all the felled firewood as quickly as possible. We all know, indeed, that even more serious disasters can occur if firewood remains abandoned in the forest for too long. It is also worth remembering, for example, that the bark beetle finds fallen trees an optimal environment for propagation and laying their larvae, which can have further consequences that are still impossible to assess. It is therefore essential to remove damaged wood before the warm season arrives. The true extent of the damage suffered in the forestry sector will only be appreciated in several decades. We all know, indeed, how long it takes a tree to grow. It is a process of decades, not years. I would also like to point out, furthermore, that forestry is not, of course, associated solely with timber production, but in some regions is above all an essential factor in maintaining forest reserves. I am therefore very proud to announce that Austrian foresters have also volunteered... (The President interrupted the speaker) Mr. President, I express my deepest sympathy to all those affected by the storms.	es
"We are also developing another proposal made by this expert group relating to the ""Managing Change"" report. I will conclude my speech with the other concerns raised in the draft resolution submitted to this House. As regards strengthening the link between competition policy and social policy, allow me to remind you that the merger regulations contain a provision allowing workers' representatives to be heard by the Commission in the relevant procedure. From a general point of view, the Commission recognises that the various bodies must properly take into account all aspects of this type of operation, including their effects on employment. Thus, for example, the public authorities, and in particular the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid which came into force on 1 January 2000 and are designed to ensure that public funding remains linked to the beneficiaries of regional aid and, consequently, to jobs linked to the investment. To this end, the granting of any regional aid is conditional on the maintenance of the investment concerned for a minimum period of five years. The same provision has been added to the Structural Funds Regulation. This means that it applies to all investments co-financed by the Structural Funds. Social cohesion and the interaction of actions carried out at Community level is at the heart of the next summit, which will be held in Lisbon. I know that we will return to these issues in the future, as we must consider how best to adapt our actions and reform them to respond to economic and social progress in Europe. Thank you very much, Commissioner. Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I understand that you have a point of order. If this is a personal statement, would you be willing to wait until the end of the debate? At that point, I will be happy to give you the floor. Mr President, this is a matter of public honour for this Parliament, not a personal statement. This morning, the President of Parliament, Ms. Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to give me the floor when I wanted to speak on a point of order. This is unfortunately not the first time that Madam President has displayed this unacceptable behavior towards me. In doing so, she violated Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure, which stipulates that requests to speak on a point of order have priority over any other request to speak. She also violated Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure, which gives all Members the right to speak on a personal matter. In my case, these were observations that refuted remarks made by another Member, Mr. Vidal-Quadras. This partisan behavior by our President should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. I will gladly accept her apologies at any time. Thank you for your statement. We will certainly ensure that we inform the President. I can assure you that, as far as I know, the President does not like to interrupt votes and start a debate. So the Assembly probably wanted to continue voting. But I thank you for your comments."	fr
"It will be composed of qualified auditors, and its independence must be and will be guaranteed by a new provision that will be added to the Financial Regulation. The new service will be accountable to me and will be supported by an Audit Monitoring Group chaired by my colleague, Mrs. Schreyer, whom I am pleased to see in this chamber this evening. As Commissioner for Budgets, my responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors. This Audit Monitoring Group will ensure rigorous and effective monitoring of internal audits. I would like to emphasize strongly that the modification of our control systems will in no way mean a relaxation. The proposed modification aims to improve the effectiveness of the systems, both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable results. I can also assure Parliament that we are not moving towards what is sometimes called a ""big bang"" approach. The prior approval of financial control for each spending department will only be abandoned if a department's internal control system proves to be entirely adequate. I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to echo the fundamental criticisms of the current centralized financial control function expressed in the two reports of the Committee of Experts. That Committee clearly stated the need to abolish centralized prior approval. It was also clear on the need to separate internal audit from financial control. Furthermore, I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors issued in 1997. The Court will, of course, be able to give its opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation, but it is worth recalling what Mr. Karlsson said in this Chamber last month: ""The Commission's internal control,"" he said, ""is not sufficiently vigorous to prevent incorrect transactions."" Thus, the Financial Controller has issued a positive prior approval in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularity that have been discovered recently. At the same time, the internal audit function is not carried out in a coordinated manner by certain bodies, notably by the financial controller himself, by the financial inspectorate, and by certain units managing directorates-general. Originally, the centralized prior approval system was undoubtedly intended to ensure vigilance, but over the years, it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions. I do not think there is any real disagreement between us on this point. I gather from paragraph 10 that the underlying concern of Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition. This will most certainly be what characterizes the change, as Members will be able to read in the reform strategy document. Our objective, that of the committee, that of the Court of Auditors, is not to abolish financial control, but to get rid of centralized financial control and do better. Before moving on to another area, I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained until the new independent internal audit service is established in a few months."	fr
It took the Council and the Commission two years to present this proposal. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to reach a decision now in March. Delaying the matter or even risking damage to the euro would be irresponsible and also a betrayal of the citizens who will be using the new, unfamiliar banknotes. Counterfeiters are expected to operate primarily in countries outside the euro zone, where awareness of the new currency is less widespread. Therefore, the protective measures also cover these countries, whose views have been given great weight. For this reason, the proposal can be described as solidarity-based and reciprocal in its consideration of the various interests, which is also mandatory. Now the Council must meet in March and make a decision. I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for listening to me. Thanks also to those who contributed to the swift treatment of this issue. I am thinking in particular of the PSE Group. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Charlotte Cederschiöld, on this report, which is an excellent starting point for strengthening criminal protection against counterfeiting in view of the introduction of the euro. The euro will enter circulation on 1 January 2002 and will then become one of the world's most important currencies. Due to its global importance, the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting. This draft framework decision therefore lays down a series of minimum rules and attempts to harmonize criminal law in this area and make its implementation by each Member State simpler and more effective. Furthermore, it provides for criminal protection of the euro even before it is put into circulation, thus closing a legal gap in some Member States. I would like to expressly support the rapporteur's view that it is necessary to extend this criminal protection to national currencies, which can continue to be exchanged even after they have been withdrawn from circulation. Each Member State must ensure the introduction of effective, appropriate, and dissuasive criminal penalties for the acts criminalized by the draft framework decision. As for the proposal to set a maximum prison sentence of eight years, I do not think there will be any problems with my country, which, although our penal code currently provides for a maximum sentence of five years for counterfeiting, has already indicated its willingness to make such an amendment. Secondly, I would like to appeal here, as our rapporteur has already done for the reasons she has indicated, to the few Member States that still have some reserves of money to dispose of them so that a decision can be taken on the matter as soon as possible. Mr President, this draft framework decision represents the first joint proposal for a criminal law regime applicable simultaneously in all 15 Member States. In doing so, we are taking further steps towards the goal of developing and shaping the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, as envisaged in Tampere.	de
It is clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem. I welcome the legal basis that has been established and the comprehensive approach of the new provisions, which I hope will correct this situation. We must ensure that nothing enters the food chain or compound feed that could lead to situations like those we have already experienced in the future. No one wants a repeat of the situation faced by farmers due to BSE. We must introduce the strictest possible provisions, and we must ensure that they work. It is of the utmost importance for producers, as well as for consumers, that we restore confidence, and the only way to do this is to rigorously tackle and resolve the problem. BSE has not disappeared. We can find it in some countries. I do not want to point the finger at any particular country, but many countries are currently facing problems similar to those we had in the United Kingdom. The problem will remain for some time. We must ensure that the entire system of identifying the origin and tracing the animal from birth to slaughter and throughout the entire food chain is part of this confidence-building mechanism. If we fail to achieve this, we will face enormous problems in the future. Finally, I have long believed, because I come from a farming background, that if we had fed animals properly and if the feed had been made from the right compounds, BSE would never have occurred. It was never the farmer who was responsible; it was the feed producers who caused this problem, and we have an obligation to ensure that it never happens again. Mr President, I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to address an issue on which there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, namely the fight against TSEs. I would also like to thank Mr. Böge for the work he has done on this matter. Considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council, pursuant to Article 152 of the Treaty, on the prevention and control of scrapie. This proposal addresses all the dangers of TSE in all animals and at all stages of the production chain. I am here today to hear your views on the first step in this process aimed at establishing a truly comprehensive Community system for the control of these diseases. In the proposal before us, I propose removing all the Community provisions currently in force relating to scrapie in sheep and goats and transferring them to the framework of the proposed directive. Detailed provisions would then be introduced into that framework. I have learned that Parliament welcomes this initiative to formulate a single text, as evidenced by your interventions this afternoon. I look forward to discussing any further improvements that Parliament may wish to suggest within the framework of the proposed legislation, especially following Mrs. Roth-Behrendt's reference to her own report and opinion on the matter.	es
As a result of this unusual procedure, Parliament is refraining from attributing responsibility for the 1997 provisions where it lies, namely with the former Commission. It was the 1996 accounts that brought down the former Commission, and the 1997 accounts are just as damning. There is therefore no reason to grant discharge. As regards the decision to close the accounts, we will abstain from voting, and finally, as regards the motion for a resolution, we would like to stress the many recommendations that have rightly been made, and we will vote in favour. Mr President, the discharge decision for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the previous Commission had already resigned by the date set for that decision and was now only dealing with current business. Now, Mrs van der Laan, to whom we should pay tribute for all the work she has done, calls on us in her report to grant the Commission a discharge for 1997. One might wonder why the current Commission should receive a discharge for the implementation of the general budget of the previous Commission - Mr Camre also mentioned this - especially since the discharge for 1996 was refused. But that is how it is. Since taking office, the new Commission has had to assume responsibility for past actions, but also for past failings. Since the system of collegiate responsibility that prevails within the Commission allows us to take a total of three decisions on discharge, namely to grant, postpone or refuse, the fact that four Commissioners who were members of the previous Commission are now back in this body has no further impact. This question should have been raised when the new Commission was sworn in. If Parliament approves the proposal made by the Committee on Budgetary Control this week and grants discharge, the Commission would be wrong to regard this decision as a blank cheque. I believe that the third part of Mrs van der Laan's report, the motion for a resolution, is the most important. The obligations it contains, set out under eight different headings, are an integral part of the discharge. Our decision depends on its implementation. During the discharge for the following financial year - 1998 is already under consideration - Parliament will have to check very carefully whether it has not congratulated the Commission a little too prematurely. We will have the touchstones when the Commission presents its reform programme. The discharge for the financial year 1998 will allow us to see whether efficiency, transparency, accountability and an open attitude towards the discharge authorities prevail. Mr President, we all know that Parliament has decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending the internal reform commitments that the new Commission would adopt.	fr
Three-quarters of these are children under the age of five. This is not due to food shortages, but rather to what we have spoken about several times today, namely increasing poverty. Food safety and the protection of biodiversity must come before commercial interests. In my view, patents on living organisms serve the sole purpose of controlling the world's food supply, especially for commercial reasons, and nothing else. In the report which I hope the Commission will prepare, I would also like to see something on the subject of women. In every context, not least in development cooperation, women seem to be completely absent, which is not at all the case. Mr President, today's debate underlines the strong need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than simply recording aid flows. The level of aid is certainly an important aspect and all rich countries, as a whole, should increase it. This should serve, not least, the purpose of combating poverty, with particular attention to development potential. On the other hand, the level of aid is only one of many instruments that can have a huge impact on the development of poor countries. A number of colleagues have highlighted today some important areas, in addition to aid, where conflicts and contradictions between different fields of action are of great concern. This concerns, for example, trade policy, agricultural policy and fisheries policy. Other important areas are of course the flow of private investment, cooperation in research and technology and the way in which the global community manages and finances certain global issues that affect us all. These global issues include climate change, biodiversity, health problems and so on. This is further confirmed by globalisation, that is, by the new economy that is emerging. In this new economy, the links between different fields of action are becoming stronger and stronger. What we are discussing today is partly, in my view, the Union's contribution to the debate on the potential and risks of globalisation, on the rules of the game that must exist to ensure adequate opportunities for poor countries. The report, the snapshot of the interconnections and contradictions between the various sectors of intervention that Mrs Maij-Weggen has requested is of course of vital importance. I wonder why the Commission has not done more. The Commission is new, it must be given time, but the absence of this snapshot indicates that there are strong tensions within it. I can only hope that Commissioner Nielson will be able to gain consensus in future discussions within the Commission. Beyond this type of report, I would also like a more positive analysis, which should be a continuous analysis. This analysis should not be limited to checking the flows of aid, but should instead focus on all the different types of aid and transfers that have an impact on poor countries. I am referring to technologies, trade aspects, cooperation in the field of research, etc.	it
However, AIDS is such a major problem in Africa today that more people die from the disease than are killed in conflicts. I hope the Minister will take the time to address this particular point. The US already has medicines, but it is unwilling to sell them at a price that the people of Africa can afford. I would like to ask the Minister what he will do about the emerging situation in Ethiopia. The country is suffering from drought and crop failure, and in six months' time, it will face exactly the same problems as a few years ago, when thousands of people died in famine. At the same time, the war between Eritrea and Ethiopia continues unabated; the European arms industry supplies plenty of weapons, and then we come and supply the food. Mr. Member, you must understand that, firstly, I disagree with your interpretation of my colleague's statement at the meeting of the Committee on Development. There is no contradiction between these positions; quite the opposite. In a presidency's program, we cannot, except in a fit of megalomania, undertake something like an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginable situations relating to all major problems, particularly in the context of external relations. It would be easy to do so, as you will surely understand. One need only take a development glossary and copy out all the questions one by one. We are responsible enough to recognize that we can only include those issues that we can deal with within the framework of our presidency and within the capabilities of the governments at Council level—and we must always be aware of this. We must understand that there are limits to the possibilities for implementation here, particularly with regard to the national indicative programs. The honourable Member referred to the problem of Ethiopia, which is included in the framework of the national indicative programs, but as you know, there are various measures at Community level to combat AIDS, and in this respect you are right, Mr. Moreover, I believe that Europe has nothing to worry about when it comes to development aid policy, for the simple reason that our conduct in this area bears any comparison with the United States. The honourable Member's question then moved on to the problem of the negative effects of armaments. This is a problem of wider political importance, which probably goes beyond the scope of the original question, but which the Council will of course discuss in the future if it so wishes and decides to address it in a specific context. Is the Council aware of the social problems caused in developing countries by EU food exports at prices below producer prices? Does the Presidency intend to take any action on this matter? Since the author of the question is not present, Question No 13 lapses. I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and, on behalf of the Presidency of the Portuguese Government, extend a personal greeting. Please allow me to express my appreciation for his eloquence and his in-depth knowledge of European affairs.	de
This situation is caused by both regional policy and the Union's economic and social policy in general. Broad sections of the Union's population strongly denounce this policy as dangerous and anti-grassroots. Unfortunately, the new guidelines point in the same direction, and there is no indication that their implementation will change this. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say a few brief words here to underline two points which these reports remind us of and which play a key strategic role in our vision of the Union. The first is the crucial and central importance we continue to attach to the principle of economic and social cohesion. We express our concern at reports which indicate that the importance of this objective is increasingly diminishing in the Commission's views. We continue to believe that economic and social cohesion is a central objective of the Union. Secondly, I agree with what I have already heard from a colleague here on the subject of islands, and I would also like to draw attention to the outermost regions. In the future, we would welcome more courage in addressing the issue of outermost regions, as is the case with my home country's archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira. I take this opportunity to ask whether the Commission can explain the reasons why the Commission's report on the outermost regions, which Parliament has been awaiting for some time, has been delayed. Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, and also for her willingness to include our suggestions in the report. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the aim of guidelines is to offer Member States guidance on how to achieve the reform objectives within the framework of programming. However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission's specifications in this regard represent more of a catalogue of possible measures within the policy areas. Providing direction and setting priorities, however, is their real purpose. I agree with the rapporteur that the Commission document unfortunately contains too few recommendations to the Member States on administrative simplification, and I underline calls for negotiations to focus on promoting a favourable environment for labour-intensive small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of finance, including arrangements for venture capital and private finance, on start-up aid, including new information technologies, and on investment in innovative sectors. I particularly support my group's amendment to paragraph 10, which is intended to ensure appropriate involvement of the private sector in project planning and implementation. I would be delighted, Mrs Schroedter, if you would include this amendment in your positive considerations, particularly from the perspective of subsidiarity. Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs we unanimously took the view that supporting Structural and Cohesion Fund interventions to improve employment opportunities for the unemployed and to promote equality between men and women is of strategic importance and a priority. Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take this idea into account, even though there is ample evidence - as we shall see later in the Berend report - of how these funds are doing a really great job of helping less developed regions to bridge the gap between them and the most developed regions in Europe.	de
To underline this—the situation is a bit complicated, of course—Parliament has, for the time being, placed the Equal program in reserve, for convenience and security reasons, so that Parliament must be convinced later on how the expenditure will be carried out. I think that's a good thing. Parliament's position throughout this procedure has remained somewhat unclear. The position in the Rules of Procedure is also not very clear, and that is why this reservation is very positive. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it is indisputable that the INTERREG initiative fosters the effort for economic and social cohesion in the European Union. But I would like to underline the special importance of the INTERREG program for the Balkan region, where political changes and military activity in recent years have had serious economic consequences for neighboring countries, and especially for my country, Greece, which is the only member country on this troubled peninsula. For Greece, for neighboring countries Italy and Austria, and for all of Europe, the economic and social reconstruction of the Balkans, which will bring them political stability, is a matter of vital importance. To date, the Phare and Obnova programs have funded some Balkan countries and not others. Under the new program period, with a view to enlargement, and taking into account the provision for funding from new resources and financial regulations, such as ISPA and SAPARD, it is absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of the three aspects of INTERREG with other funding to third countries. We therefore welcome the references to Chapter 7 of the European Commission's text on the adoption of INTERREG guidelines. Efforts to coordinate and, consequently, to achieve greater planning efficiency, must concern all programs equally. I say this because in the MEDA program, during the previous legislative term, there were some problems that will need to be overcome in order to treat all countries participating in this program equally. I would like to conclude, Mr. President, by noting that the new planning of transnational collaboration zones has not taken into account the unique characteristics of the Mediterranean, which would justify the creation of a special zone for maritime and island regions. We therefore ask the Commission to give special consideration to the issue of maritime and island collaboration in a forthcoming review of the planning of these zones. I conclude, Mr. President, by emphasizing the need for the European Union to insist on such initiatives that aim to eliminate the inequalities between our peripheries and their harmonious development. And, since today is Valentine's Day, as a former mayor of a peripheral city, I propose that today we all declare our love for the European peripheries, which need it so much. Mr. President, dear Commissioner Fischler, development in rural areas can and must respond to three approaches: specifically, the preservation of jobs, the care of the landscape, and, last but not least, the care of local culture, for this is indeed important.	es
I will therefore judge on the actions. In the meantime, I approve and encourage this desire clearly expressed in your communication. However, two points are essential: the simplification and application of Community law. In 1998, there were 123 referrals to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition, and 25% of environmental directives are not applied or transposed. The events of recent days show us how essential this is. Community law must not remain unapplied because it is too complex or too fussy. The Union must not fall into this trap, and here again, I regret that your communication does not go into more detail. You are realistic about the fact that the welfare state will no longer be able to provide the right answers to the problems we face, including unemployment. I regret, however, that a clear option was not put forward. The emphasis should have been placed on rejecting any welfare policy and, on the contrary, on promoting initiative and responsibility. You do not emphasize the aging of our population, an aging that will have fundamental impacts on the structure of our society, not only from an economic point of view but also in terms of public health. It is, in fact, a silent revolution, and from this point of view, I expected more from your communication. Finally, you emphasize European research as being at the heart of our future. However, you do not tell us what resources you wish to implement. Ethical principles are also at the heart of this research. Your communication says nothing about this. Mr. President, you want to better inform the citizen. Start by strengthening ties with Parliament: we are the representatives of these citizens. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot but agree with the general thrust of the five-year programme and the programme for the year 2000, illustrated this morning with such passion by President Prodi. In both documents, the emphasis was placed on the need to define new forms of European government and to implement, to this end, a new Commission agenda, defining the most immediate priorities in pursuit of the objective of full employment, through more effective coordination of the economic and social policies of the States and - I would like to stress this - above all of the nations participating in the Monetary Union, which must be helped to constitute the first example of enhanced cooperation. To this end, I will limit myself to stressing the importance of three priority choices, among others, which should inspire, in addition to the Commission's agenda, the work of the European Union in the coming months, also in the formulation of the action programmes of the governments of the countries of the Union. Firstly, the promotion and participation in the definition of joint projects for the creation of an integrated network of services in the transport and energy sectors, with the support of the European Investment Bank. Secondly, the adoption, as binding parameters in the formulation of action programmes on employment, of investments to be made in the various countries and through Community projects in the priority sectors of research, innovation and the qualification of the human factor.	fr
The Commission pointed out in committee that it intends to present a novel food directive in the future. However, this should not prevent us from harmonizing the directives now, so as to avoid legal uncertainty arising from different directives. We therefore assume that you will also accept our amendment concerning genetically modified organisms. The fact that Directive 70/524 still contains the old text is due to the fact that the Seed Directive was presented to Parliament in 1986, and we negotiated with the Commission until 1988, while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994. Clearly, Parliament did not attach the same importance to genetically modified organisms at that time as we did later, when I was rapporteur. Therefore, Commissioner Byrne, we believe that you will accept the amendments we have tabled, including those concerning the legal basis. If that is not the case, we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee in order to then negotiate with you on this sensitive issue, similar to what we did with the Seeds Directive. I would like to point out once again that the text we have now drafted is valid as a compromise for both your Legal Services and ours. We therefore do not need to renegotiate the text; we simply need to incorporate it into this directive. I am eager to hear your comments on our proposals, Commissioner Byrne! Mr President! Commissioner! Is the regulation of additives in feedingstuffs a matter of competition or consumer policy? For the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee, it is a matter of competition. We must certainly take account of the competitiveness of the feed industry by harmonizing the regulations for substances authorized before and after 1988. A rise in feed prices must be prevented, and therefore Amendments Nos 4 and 5 by Mr Doyle should be supported. First and foremost, however, as Mr. Graefe zu Baringdorf put it in his report, this is a consumer policy issue. Food safety must have absolute priority in all discussions about animal nutrition. When we talk about transparency in the food chain, this applies from the pitchfork to the dinner fork, and so consumer protection logically begins with animal feed. Antibiotics, growth promoters, and genetically modified organisms added to animal feed ultimately find their way into the human food chain. As a consequence of the dioxin scandal, it was clear to all of us that we must finally step out of this dirty corner. Regulating additives in animal feed is a step in the right direction. According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty, we are obliged to eliminate the causes of danger to human health. The emphasis is clearly on causes. Consequently, we must turn off the tap on the original sources of pollutants – harmful additives in animal feed. Otherwise, I believe we're just treating the symptoms but not addressing the causes. The public is particularly critical of the use of GMOs. We must address the public's growing awareness of GMOs and regulate their use in feed accordingly. First, if an additive consists of or contains genetically modified organisms, it may only be approved if it is safe for human health and the environment.	de
Mr President, this initiative is gaining in importance as the economic and social problems in Europe's cities worsen and their citizens increasingly feel that the administration of their city or district is moving further and further away from them. Added to this are the profound social changes resulting from the enlargement of the European Union. We must therefore make timely efforts to promote the economic revitalisation and social cohesion of our cities. Tackling these problems is also a matter of urgency, given the significant influence cities have on the surrounding region and their historical and cultural role. However, the success of this project requires the commitment and participation of all citizens, as well as the mobilisation of less active social groups and those particularly affected by the economic and social crisis. We would like to stress the importance of the balanced participation of women and their organisations in the planning and implementation of programmes under the URBAN initiative. As the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we would also like to point out that funding must be provided for infrastructure measures that facilitate women's professional activities, particularly with regard to reconciling professional and family responsibilities, and more generally for facilities that promote intergenerational solidarity and social solidarity. The effective implementation of this initiative could have a multiplier effect, perhaps inspiring similar projects at regional and local level. This would make it possible to further enhance its political significance, because women must finally feel the practical impact of European policy in their daily lives. Mr President, in our committee we welcomed the Commission's proposal to improve the integration of local communities and ethnic minorities, as well as increasing security and crime prevention, as priorities for the URBAN programme. In committee, we considered it necessary that the economic and social revitalization of urban areas must go hand in hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities, so that measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia must be an integral part of the programs to be financed under URBAN. We considered increasing citizens' sense of security, and thus combating everyday urban crime, to be a key task in the revitalization of urban areas. Our committee has established that innovative and effective crime prevention and control at the municipal level requires differentiated measures; these include the integration of crime prevention into urban planning, measures to prevent juvenile delinquency, the reintegration of offenders, and models for effective cooperation between various actors at the local level, such as the police, the judiciary, or social services. As a committee, we adopted our recommendation unanimously because it was very important to us to continue URBAN—which has been successfully implemented in the past—because we believe that only with such programs will we succeed in achieving long-term, peaceful coexistence among all residents of the European Union. For this reason, we warmly welcome such programs. Regarding the largest of the four Community initiatives, INTERREG III, I would like to draw attention to the concerns of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.	de
Why did the Council not inform us? Why did the Commission not inform us of this formal request from Macedonia? Mr President, Commissioner, from a political point of view, the Balkans are not simply a dark cave. One only has to look at the considerable positive developments that have taken place in the Republic of Macedonia in recent – difficult – years. The appalling spiral of ethnic violence in neighbouring Kosovo has not spilled over into Macedonian territory. Paradoxically, although it is true, the war in the Kosovo Polje camp has had precisely the opposite effect: a clear reduction of the dangerous gap in trust between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority. In the eyes of the Macedonian majority, the Albanians have behaved with great loyalty towards the common state during the international outbreak of the conflict in Kosovo. In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have generously fulfilled their obligations as neighbours towards the tortured Albanian population of Kosovo. This unusual outcome of the conflict in Kosovo can therefore rightly be called the second internal political birth of the Republic of Macedonia. The balanced and commendable report by Mr Swoboda is very concretely linked to this surprising and happy outcome. In other words, the European Union knows what position to take towards Macedonia. It must help this region, which has recently become a place of refuge for a great many refugees, to properly play its role as a promoter of the Stability Pact in the Balkans. Mr President, I have been dealing with Macedonia for eight years, and I take the liberty of contradicting Mr Dupuis. What we are doing is not hypocrisy: we have come at the right time, and I believe that the Macedonians are happy about it. I ask you not to be so hostile and to moderate your statements: I think we should approach the issue in a more positive light. Macedonia was not at war, but it has suffered from the conflict in neighbouring countries and from sanctions and is still suffering from the consequences of sanctions rightly imposed on neighbouring countries. It was greatly affected by the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war. It should therefore also be said that Macedonia has shown surprising continuity in its democratic developments: it is a country that has to deal with difficult problems of inter-ethnic relations within its borders and is solving them with ever better results. I would like to explicitly emphasize that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on minorities and the way it has dealt with the problem, and that the involvement of 30 percent of the Albanian population in government life and politics and at the social level is a prerequisite for peaceful coexistence in the country. I am pleased that the demand formulated in Mr Swoboda's report is being followed up at the beginning of March, namely that a European delegation should finally be established in this country too, that we should finally be considered as the European Union. I believe that the start of these negotiations on the stabilisation and association process is the logical consequence of fruitful and positive development in the country.	it
"I think Mr. Swoboda's report is excellent, and I fully endorse it. Mr. President, I too would like to congratulate Mr. Swoboda on his report. It is welcome that so many people here support the approach he has chosen. It is about tackling stability in the region structurally, and that is also the content of the agreement with the Republic of Macedonia that we are discussing today. While the actual implementation of the Stability Pact has yet to get underway, the Commission has worked quickly in developing the new instrument, the Stabilization and Association Agreement. This will begin the contractual stabilization of the countries of the former Yugoslavia. It concerns the countries that are not yet eligible for a pre-accession agreement. The current agreement is actually a kind of ""pre-pre-agreement,"" but with the prospect of future membership. This integration of countries through active treaties is a very good instrument, provided the agreements stipulated therein are vigorously implemented, so that the hoped-for stabilization actually occurs. Macedonia remains a potential powder keg and, as such, has a history. However, it has the ambition to shed this image. This requires internal stability. The new government will be approached about this, and the agreement can provide an agenda for reforms, including the direct participation and equal rights of the Albanian minority. The country now needs, above all, calm to establish internal order and find the path to greater prosperity. We, the Social Democrats, appeal to the opposition to act in accordance with this view. It must support the much-praised Macedonia model. But the country also, and above all, needs external stability. What use is internal stability if the environment is unstable? This stability is necessary in relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania, and Bulgaria. The region must acknowledge that Macedonia exists and will continue to exist. External stability means open borders and regional cooperation. Minorities and majorities must be given space for human and cultural exchange. Macedonia's stability is closely linked to developments in neighboring countries. The Kosovo problem is well known; the international community has a massive presence there. The Albanian factor appears to be underestimated. In the Union's view, the time is not yet ripe for a Stabilization and Association Agreement with that country. But when? The very arguments for concluding an agreement with Macedonia but not yet with Albania fill us with so much concern that a wait-and-see attitude towards Albania by the Union is truly unacceptable. What is the Commission's position on this issue? Yugoslavia is also a weak point in stability and thus a threat to a stable Macedonia. We must wait and see what happens there. The mood in Belgrade is becoming more difficult to assess by the day. However, we support the Council's decision to shift the focus of sanctions. This at least represents a serious attempt to finally support the opposition, which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations. What further steps will the Union take in this direction if the opposition's demand for early elections is granted?"	de
Secondly, it is clear that the reform will require some new investment in training and technology; thirdly, it is clear that much preparation will have to be made for enlargement, and these initiatives already have an impact on the availability of resources. On the other hand, as we take on new tasks - which the Council and Parliament will certainly ask us to do - we will have to identify the so-called 'negative priorities' and eliminate them in order to create new spaces. A key feature of the reform will therefore be the introduction of a more rigorous procedure to link the setting of priorities to the allocation of resources on the basis of an activity-based management system. I would like to stress, however, that while internal discipline on setting of priorities will certainly be introduced by the Commission, it can only be truly effective if Parliament and the Council support it and take an equally rigorous approach to the requests made to the Commission. The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of the Van Hulten report. I conclude, Mr President, by thanking the House for its attention to this necessarily long speech, and by extending my heartfelt thanks once again to the rapporteur, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the other committees which have expressed their opinions. We hope that we can soon begin working side by side with Parliament to finalise the strategic package of reforms and, most importantly of all, to be able to collaborate with Parliament in finalising the implementing measures which will be necessary over the years for such a complex reform. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. (The sitting closed at 11.15 p.m.) Middle East peace process (continuation) The agenda is the continuation of the statements by the Council and the Commission on the Middle East peace process. I am very grateful to the President of the Council for the statement on the Middle East which he made this morning at the start of the debate and for having been able to listen to some of the analyses carried out by Minister Gama, who has just returned from the region. My only regret is that my commitment to open the European Agency for Reconstruction on Monday meant that I could not take part in the trip to the Middle East, although, as I said before - but that is another story - circumstances meant that I stopped at Munich airport and could not get to Thessaloniki. That is life. I hope that Members will forgive me if I cannot stay until the end of the debate, as I would do in normal circumstances. The debate was scheduled for this morning and on that basis I had decided to meet the visiting delegation from the Balkans this evening. I therefore hope that I can count on the House's understanding on this occasion. I assure you that I do not intend to make this a habit. Like Parliament, I welcome the efforts made by the United States in relaunching negotiations between Syria and Israel, despite Syria's decision to say that it needed more time before resuming the talks, which were due to start today. There is reasonable hope that the foundations for a peace agreement can be laid in the near future.	it
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have brought you a little present. Here is a piece of naphtha sent by an inhabitant of the island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me: ""At every tide, the beach is covered with crude oil leaked from the Erika. At every tide, volunteers, soldiers and firefighters remove huge masses of this black, viscous and dense tar. When will we have a clean beach again and when will this devastating accident end?"" Yes, this Erika accident, like that of the Russian ship in Turkey, is unacceptable and intolerable in an age when high technology is skyrocketing. It is even more unacceptable because it occurred twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, when we had said and repeated many times that it would never happen again. It is undoubtedly the responsibility of politicians, and therefore ours, to guarantee the safety of maritime transport. We must really guarantee citizens that a disaster like this will never happen again. Listening to you, Commissioner, one feels a little frustrated because those who have already dealt with these issues know that the Commission and Parliament had prepared, in 1992 I believe, a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals contained in the resolution drawn up today by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. Because it is true that it must be said and repeated: the Erika is one catastrophe too many. For this reason, it is urgent that the European Union undertakes a drastic revision of its directives on maritime transport, to make them more restrictive and to establish a clear and precise regime of the responsibilities of cargo owners. For example, Shell and British Petroleum refused to have their oil transported by the Erika. Why is the responsibility of the charterer, Total, not recognised in this case? Your proposals also need to include the obligation of double hulls and the ban on degassing at sea. A European body of inspectors must be set up so that they can effectively and efficiently check the condition of ships. It is also urgent that the European Union commit to reforming the IMO. After all, what is the point of drawing up restrictive directives if most ships do what they want when they sail the oceans? Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address a heartfelt thought to all the volunteers, friends of nature and birds who spontaneously and generously respond and rush to the aid of birds soaked in diesel fuel, organising their rescue with the means available. I am a first-hand witness to this exceptional work. You are certainly aware that around 200,000 birds will die because of the oil spill, which is an ecological disaster of enormous proportions and virtually without precedent. You are also certainly aware of how difficult it is these days to conserve species and how difficult it is to conserve habitats. In this regard, Commissioner, you have said nothing about how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of nature and ecosystems. Once again, there will be no clearly identified responsible parties. In the meantime, it is always nature that gets the worst of it."	it
We are at the beginning of an era of creating a new law, in which the right to exploit intellectual property will clash with the public interest in its dissemination and exploitation by the general public. Mr. President, I thank the rapporteur for this excellent report, which nevertheless concludes that our adherence, as a Community, to these two WIPO treaties must not be limited to a simple institutional evolution, however important that may be: the possibility for the European Community and the WIPO Assembly to work together. This ratification is also necessary with regard to the enlargement of Europe. But behind this Community adherence lies an objective that, in my opinion, is still too virtual and yet too offensive to some Member States. It is the affirmation of a European cultural policy on which I hope we, Parliament, the Commission, and the Council, can agree. Those who refer to cultural policy are referring, among other things, to the defense of the role of creation, the recognition of authors, and the production of a demanding culture. And even more so today, when Europe must adopt a new policy on copyright and related rights, it is urgent—as has been emphasized on several occasions—to define and redefine what an author is. We remain too vague on this matter, and from now on, new technologies force us to make this effort at clarification. Mr. President, Commissioner, the signing of the WIPO Treaties represented a considerable positive step in the global development of the information society. These Treaties crystallize a decades-long copyright tradition and constitute a balanced and well-thought-out solution for regulating copyright and related rights. However, the entry into force of the Treaties and their final form will depend both on this recommendation and on its implementation by the interested parties. The WIPO Treaty has already entered into force in the United States with the help of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act, a legislative measure that has helped preserve the delicate balance of the WIPO Treaty. The European Union, too, must make progress in adapting its laws to the provisions of the WIPO Treaty. It is also worrying that the positions adopted by the previous Parliament do not support the balanced system of the WIPO Treaty. The opinion adopted at first reading on the Copyright Directive was severely distorted, and the balance is shifting in a direction detrimental to Europe. The recommendations proposed do not improve the position of culture in Europe; quite the contrary. The amendments proposed by Parliament would be limited to improving the possibilities for established media companies to transfer their former shares of over 80 percent to a new framework through rigid and scaled copyright laws. I am not referring here to Ms. Charlotte Cederschiöld's recommendation, which in itself is a wonderful proposal, but to copyright as addressed by the previous Parliament.	es
"(IT) On behalf of the Italian communists, I wish to express my deep dissatisfaction with the contents of the document that, according to expectations, was supposed to formulate the strategic objectives for Europe up to the year 2005. Employment: For years, the link between economic growth and increased employment has not corresponded to reality, yet it is once again being proposed as a recipe—one that has proven useless—for solving the extremely serious problem of unemployment. And yet the President is a seasoned economist. Pensions: The document states: ""The responsibility for modernizing social protection systems will continue to fall to the Member States."" Yet, in the case of Italy, the Commission intervened repeatedly, repeatedly calling for a rapid modification of the pension system, aimed at reducing rights and benefits. And yet, President Prodi, due to the important guidance he gave the Italian Government in those years, knows how many and what sacrifices our fellow citizens have been asked to make and made in order to join the euro, and he is aware of the important role Italy plays in European development. For this reason, we cannot accept calls for further pension cuts. There is an agreement on this issue that provides for its review in 2001. It should not be revised one day earlier or one day later. Moreover, the cost dynamics in this regard are completely under control. Therefore, the Commission must refrain from this unacceptable ideological approach and from these statements that create instability and uncertainty among citizens. I mentioned the case of Italy not only because the President is very familiar with it, but also because, based on EU data (Eurostat), it is clear that for Italy, welfare spending—currently at 25.9%—has not only been lower since 1990 than the EU average (28.2%), but is also far lower than the average of countries considered exemplary, such as Germany (29.9%) and France (30.8%). Europe's role: first, we must reaffirm that Europe rejects war as an instrument for resolving international conflicts; then we can talk about the Union's ""military"" role. Agriculture and health: our view of the issue differs from that of the Commission: for us, there are no consumers, there are citizens who want to eat healthy food, with products whose purpose is not competitiveness, but rather healthiness, quality, and respect for the environment, elements that, moreover, create jobs. (FR) The proposed measures and the program presented by Mr. Prodi are extremely vague, and social issues are, once again, absent. Furthermore, the word ""social"" seems to be banished from the Commission's vocabulary, while liberal and North American references abound. Renano Prodi embraces the highly controversial concept of ""good governance""; controversial because it favors dirigisme over the proper functioning of democracy, and because it refers to the notion defined by the IMF, whose ideological content is totally dominated by liberalism and monetarism."	es
Coherence and action are needed. The next Lomé Convention must specify investment in education and encourage regional cooperation and the participation of local authorities. The participation of local authorities is of the utmost importance. And, in a much broader framework, I consider the conversion of the debt of poor countries into poverty eradication and sustainable development programs, as well as the control of fraud and corruption, to be priorities. We must move forward with concrete and coherent actions. The populations of poor countries are beginning to despair. I ask the Commission to take steps towards East Timor's urgent accession to the Lomé Convention, as a way of promoting, among other measures, the eradication of poverty and accelerating its economic, cultural, and social development, in order to strengthen its internal democratization. Finally, I congratulate the Council Presidency on the upcoming Europe-Africa Summit and call on all participants to make contributions to the implementation of practical actions to promote peace, democracy, and the eradication of poverty in underdeveloped African countries. Thank you, Commissioner. The debate is now closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00. Stabilization and Association Agreement with FYROM The next item is the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr. Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the recommendation for a Council decision authorizing the Commission to negotiate a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 - 1999/2121(COS)). Mr. President, dear Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a country that has gone through truly difficult times, a country that, thanks to its own efforts, its will, and undoubtedly the support of the international community, has experienced very positive progress. If, consequently, the European Union, the Council, and the Commission propose—I dare say this term without a doubt—to conclude a stabilization and association agreement for the first time in southeastern Europe, in the Balkans. Parliament will, I suppose, join this proposal tomorrow. This will be thanks to, or in recognition of, the fact that FYROM/Macedonia has worked hard to enjoy a good position economically, but also, and above all, politically, with regard to the war in neighboring countries and in relation to its own ethnic minority. Having an ethnic minority of 33 or even 35% in one's own country is no small feat considering the environment in which this country finds itself. The country and its politicians, although certainly different, have always done very good work, and this deserves our recognition. The Commission is proposing that we conclude an agreement with the Council. I would like to make a few observations regarding areas where there may be differences of opinion, although I would also like to particularly highlight and acknowledge in this context the work and interest shown by Commissioner Patten for FYROM/Macedonia and the entire region. First: the regional approach. In my opinion, the regional approach is, if I understand it correctly, important and necessary.	es
Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty would indeed prove insufficient in the worst-case scenario. In this regard, it is necessary—and I would like to confirm and reaffirm this here now—for the Commission to persevere in its efforts to ensure that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights to be drafted is incorporated into the Treaty and establishes binding rights that are enforceable before the courts. In this regard, the Commission must also persevere in the ongoing consolidation of the common area of freedom, security, and justice. Consequently, in this regard, I maintain a position opposite to that of the two speakers who preceded me. The only way to respond to the irrational, misleading, and demagogic statements of the right, the far right, is by contrasting them with the principles of immigration and the right to asylum. However, I wish to emphasize this, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy on employment and combating social exclusion, since unemployment, marginalization, and growing inequalities constitute an optimal breeding ground for anti-European nationalist sentiments and actions. Mr. President of the Commission, I would also like to review in this context the problems you have raised regarding globalization and the perception of it held by large sections of the population. The feeling of powerlessness, lack of influence, and lack of support from the State lead, at best, to distancing themselves from politics and abstaining from elections, as occurred in the European elections, and at worst, to extremist electoral behavior. In this context, the Union—something that not everyone understands—must offer our EU citizens the EU itself as a means, as a protection against the negative effects of globalization. We are building a home, but too few of our own citizens truly feel at home there. Therefore, not only is a reform of the World Trade Organization and the economic architecture necessary—and it is significant that the President of the Commission forgot to mention the reform of financial institutions, of the international financial architecture—but it is also necessary to adopt confidence-building measures for our citizens, who are entitled to expect help and support from the EU, and within the EU, in the face of the inevitable but painful processes of adaptation to new global circumstances. In this context, what the Commission can say about strengthening Europe's voice is important. Mr. President, you yourself spoke today of a model to which, unfortunately, I find too few references in the document. You said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural, and ecological development, within and outside the Union, that is clearly distinguished from other models, including the American one. The United States, besides being our partners, is also our competitor in this regard—not adversaries, but competitors, and we must compete to determine who can offer the best model to our citizens. I hope that the statements we are making so forcefully today will also find greater relevance in the Commission's documents. Madam President, Mr. President of the Commission, your Commission's greatest legacy to the European Union could be your contribution to restoring and redistributing the Commission's powers and responsibilities, which are becoming increasingly intertwined and confusing, and which could perhaps even be extended to the Union.	es
The authors of this question are not proposing any solution, but are calling for a new tax, for more bureaucracy, for a measure that goes against market mechanisms, and are bringing an inter-group concept before the plenary session, bypassing the relevant parliamentary committee, in contradiction with several of Parliament's decisions. In my view, and I say this clearly, this question is ideologically motivated and not solution-oriented. I repeat that I consider this to be the wrong path. Why do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so questionable? Firstly, as the Commissioner also confirmed, because it represents a very heavy burden on the capital markets. A reduced tax would also have serious repercussions for the capital markets, because such a tax on speculation would significantly reduce the profitability of investments. Furthermore, such a measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial markets. This would run counter to the principle of the free movement of capital, which is at the heart of the internal market. Secondly, speculative capital is difficult to identify. Third, tax measures can easily be circumvented if they are not introduced simultaneously in all countries, as there are then many safe havens. Fourth, this measure is hardly technically feasible, creates a significant bureaucratic and administrative burden, and is difficult to monitor. The measure we should take concerns part of the resolution before us. This concerns strengthening banking supervision. It concerns clarifying liability for transactions. It concerns a regulatory framework at international level. It concerns examining national laws to determine whether they correspond to the Basel Committee's rules and whether these can be further disseminated. I have a major problem with a crucial point in this resolution, which we also cannot accept as it stands. This is point 9. If we have followed the Commissioner correctly, we know that the Commission's knowledge of this matter will lead it to say no to the Tobin tax. If the knowledge, the debate, and the arguments are as we present them and as they seem justified to me, I believe it is irresponsible to mobilize the Commission for six more months and thereby create uncertainty on the financial and capital markets. The capital market does not expect us to create uncertainty; it needs clarity. That is why we reject point 9 and request a separate vote. Madam President, the debate on the taxation of short-term financial transactions is not new. We have been discussing the Tobin tax proposal for 20 years, and yet this issue is still relevant because we really need concrete and sincere answers based on scrupulous research. We need to know to what extent a taxation of short-term financial transactions is actually desirable and feasible. Today, this question has indeed taken on a new dimension, since every day, USD 1,500 billion travels around the world 24 hours a day, in search of attractive investments, and at most 3% of this sum is linked to the real economy.	fr
The recent dioxin scare in Belgium and before that the BSE crisis in Great Britain, as well as the ongoing controversy over the safety of genetically modified foods, have contributed to undermining consumer confidence in food. If the Commission succeeds in rebuilding confidence in the food production chain, it will simultaneously rebuild confidence in the European institutions themselves and demonstrate that they are capable of protecting the rights of European citizens. I am therefore pleased that the issue of food safety, public health and consumer confidence have a prominent place in the Commission's work programme for 2000. However, I have been disappointed by the nature of the proposal for the creation of a European Food Authority in the recent White Paper. At present the proposal is more of an advisory agency to the Executive, rather than an independent body with legislative and decision-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration, which has already established its credibility in this field. In addition, future legislation will have to address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European Food Authority and national authorities, for example the Irish Food Safety Authority. This body, together with the recently established cross-border food safety body in Ireland, is already doing good work. It would be a tragedy if these efforts were undermined by shortcomings in EU legislation. My fear is that such shortcomings in EU legislation could lead to jurisdictional wars between national and EU bodies which should be working together and not against each other. That is something we must guard against. Madam President, today's presentation by President Prodi was necessarily just a brush stroke. We expect the details year by year, for example with regard to the social action programme which is to be presented this year. We will also look at it from the perspective of social and employment policy and subject it to a series of tests. We will see to what extent it is possible to create an equilateral policy triangle, combining economic policy, employment policy and social policy. At the moment, social policy is lagging behind economic and employment policy. In the context of the employment strategy, we will look at deepening and broadening the strategy following the review carried out under the Portuguese Presidency and in the context it has proposed. On the social dimension, we will look at whether a deepening of the internal market with a social component is proposed. The explosion of mergers, disposals and takeovers that we are seeing as the market strengthens means that we need to update the matrix of directives on information and consultation of workers adopted in the past, but we also need to complement them with a new general framework of information and consultation provisions and an update of the directive on European works councils. We also need a code of conduct for companies to ensure that they actually work in partnership with employees to manage change.	it
On average, the Commission has 2.9 staff to manage USD 10 million of aid, compared to 4.3 in the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in the largest Member States. This is a serious problem: there are too many financial instruments, each with its own characteristics and, in particular, a number of different budget headings. It is difficult to reconcile this with the requirements of an effective management system. To address and resolve these problems, the Community must engage in real dialogue with the Member States and the Parliament. It is absolutely essential to address the issue of coherence in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means engaging in discussions in the appropriate institutional context, i.e. with the Council and the Parliament. The lack of concerted action between the 15 Member States and between them and the Community also needs to be addressed. By focusing the Community's development policy on internationally agreed strategies and objectives, we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States. This is pretty much the line outlined earlier by Mr Amado, President-in-Office of the Council. Nowadays, when we talk about policies, we are engaged in a process of convergence. This is part of the solution. We are engaged in formulating new policy orientations and we need to identify priority areas for Community intervention. Everything has become increasingly complex, and this is also true for development cooperation. No donor can address the entire spectrum of issues alone, ranging from macroeconomic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting issues, such as gender, environment, good governance and institutional reforms. It is important to find flexible mechanisms that allow for a division of labour according to the skills and capacities of different donors in each developing country. This should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sectoral policies for Community intervention. This is what we aim to achieve. In order to identify priority areas for Community support, the specific characteristics of the Community in relation to Member States and international institutions need to be taken into account. I will mention just a few: our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation; our neutrality and the protection of the general interests of the Community; the fact that we represent a critical mass and that we are able to undertake interventions of a relatively large scale compared to what individual Member States can normally do. And then there is our concrete presence: basically, I think our greatest asset is precisely the fact that, as a successful attempt at regional cooperation ourselves, we are seen as a neutral and welcome partner in this global experiment, a role that no one else can claim. It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework. The Commission must take up this dual challenge by presenting a proposal for a general political declaration in the coming months.	it
The situation has now escalated to the point where the Pentagon has banned American forces from returning to northern Mitrovica. They have since been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish, and Swedish troops. It is easy to despair in the face of violence and hatred, but it is vital for Kosovo, the Balkans, and Europe that we do not fail here. The Stability Pact imposes major obligations on us. This issue therefore becomes a test of the credibility of the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Currently, Kosovo suffers from a severe shortage of suitable personnel. Last autumn, Bernard Kouchner called for a civilian police force. I am therefore pleased to hear that Mr. Javier Solana will be bringing together interior ministers this weekend to discuss the police issue. I hope these talks will focus primarily on Kosovo, so that the desperate situation there can be ended. As far as the Balkans and Kosovo are concerned, I also hope that the Council will support Parliament's and, as I understand, the Commission's call for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo. Mr. Solana, the situation in Kosovo has taught us many things, such as the creation of military capacities for crisis management, which has already been put into practice. Another, at least equally important, experience, however, is that preventing a crisis is more important than later firefighting operations. For this reason, the EU also needs independent and credible means of conflict prevention. As far as the Commission is concerned, Commissioner Patten has already undertaken several commendable initiatives in this direction. I am thinking here of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations, as well as the creation of headline goals for non-military operations and a Commission crisis center. My final question to Mr. Javier Solana is: What concrete steps are planned for conflict prevention? How is this organized in Mr. Solana's office and coordinated with the work of the Commission? Mr. President, Mr. Solana, you enjoy the full support and confidence of the Liberal Group, but we would like to remind you of the enormous responsibility that now rests on your shoulders. I am thinking, firstly, of the important humanitarian, peacekeeping, and peacemaking tasks that lie ahead. But I am also thinking of your responsibility to ensure that the new European cooperation in the field of defense does not drive a wedge between NATO and the EU, or between the USA and Europe. Such a division would only benefit those tyrannical and despotic states that threaten freedom and human rights. I believe you have noted the concerns expressed by some members of the American Congress here in Parliament last week. You must allay these concerns, Mr. Solana. You yourself said that we can achieve something if we work together across the Atlantic. Disunity weakens us and thereby prolongs the suffering of the oppressed. Therefore, dear Mr. Solana, maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and also consider Norway, Turkey, and Canada.	de
Respect for and the inviolability of human values, the rights of minorities and the rights of all citizens living in the European Union are the foundations of the principle of the rule of law in the EU. This is why the Convention on Fundamental Rights should also be legally binding and not relegated to the role of a mere declaration. Equally important is our support for the democratic forces in Austria; none of us has the intention of isolating this country. We know perfectly well that a large part of the Austrians respect these values, as they have demonstrated, also publicly, through their protest, which did not take place outside the borders of Austria. There are certainly also many voters who wanted to give voice to their strong desire to see a radical change of direction in Austrian politics. In my opinion, Parliament should support these democratic forces. I also call on the Austrian President to make every effort to try to form a government based on these democratic forces. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to underline the value of an attitude such as that which the chairman of our group, Francis Wurtz, mentioned a moment ago. I appreciate the statements of the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have refused official contacts with the Austrian Government if Jörg Haider's party were to be included. This emphasis of ours is all the more important because, as is well known, we substantially disagree with the policies pursued by this Europe: with its economic and social policies, with its democratic deficit, with the involvement of these same countries in the dramatic war in the Balkans. This disagreement underlines even more today's appreciation: an exceptional element, because the danger of a rebirth, in Europe, of an irrational and neo-Nazi component is exceptional. This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe. We are talking about ourselves, not Austria. We know the social causes which, with unemployment and uncertainty, contribute to fuelling tendencies in that direction; we know the cultural causes - xenophobic, racist - but we cannot fail to point out in the inability and unwillingness of these far-right forces to come to terms with Nazism, the possibility of building an explosive mixture in Europe. He speaks of the Alpine arc, he speaks of all our countries: conditions are being created in which a danger to democracy and European civilisation can be reborn. The position taken by the Presidency has shown itself to be aware of this civilisational drama. Europe shows that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe encounters a soul. Now, however, it should be consistent in its actions, and the first to be consistent should be the Commission which, instead, has demonstrated here an opacity and a lability that make the value of the position of the Presidency even more evident. This is the correction that must be imposed on the Commission's action. Madam President, colleagues, in the fundamental democratic principle of respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, against any new or old fascism, Nazism or communism, and given that all the previous speakers have spoken of the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we see, today, this sovereignty denied by this very Parliament.	it
It is true that the problem of the timber sector is terribly complex. You have indeed spoken of releasing funds for timber storage because it must not depreciate. On the other hand, the municipalities that were not affected by the storms will also suffer losses, since the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze logging for four years. So these municipalities that have not suffered losses will still see their revenues decrease. All this to tell you that the problem is eminently complex and I thank the Commission again for pushing the analysis of this situation as far as possible. I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that there is, of course, an economic disaster, but that the real ecological disasters are still to come. You said it yourself, Commissioner, these disasters, these storms are not always natural and we believe that they are the first signs of climate change. Therefore, we must review our policies to take this fact into account. Mr. President, anyone who arrived here by car, train, or plane will have seen the extent of the damage caused, particularly in France, by the unprecedentedly violent hurricanes that struck Europe at the end of last month. Faced with a disaster of such magnitude, what can the elected members of the European Parliament do? First of all, I would like to pay tribute to all my fellow mayors and local elected officials who, on a daily basis, have had to reassure the population, organize solidarity, and cooperate with public services. They have earned the trust of their fellow citizens. I would also like to thank the emergency services and armed forces of the EU Member States who, as part of exemplary intergovernmental cooperation, have come to support the efforts of their French colleagues. I would also like to reflect on the paradoxical situation in which we find ourselves with regard to emergency aid. If this disaster had occurred in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims, but in our countries, nothing of the sort is possible due to the lack of an adequate credit line. We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and states from helping businesses affected by the disaster, in the name of an overly narrow application of Community competition rules. I am thinking in particular of the fishing and shellfish farming businesses that have been particularly hard hit. As you said, Commissioner, it must be possible to compensate for forced shutdowns and for investments that have to be completely redone to be able to call on the FIFG. Beyond that, I believe that the mechanical application of the POPs is no longer appropriate in the devastated coastal regions. I therefore ask the Commission to abandon this and, on the contrary, to help maritime professionals make the new investments that are urgently needed. Mr. President, dear colleagues, the storms that ravaged France on the night of December 26 and 27 caused, as has been said, 90 deaths and 75 billion francs, or 11 billion euros, in damage.	fr
The Council's draft contains serious deficiencies, particularly with regard to legal protection. According to rapporteur Di Pietro, the draft contains even significant deficiencies. The Convention allows for a chain of requests for mutual legal assistance, with authorities and criminal justice systems from other Member States being assigned to each link. This chain is structured in such a way that no single judge can monitor it as a whole. Accompanying measures are needed, such as the obligation for investigating officers to appear as witnesses upon request in every criminal case in which their documents are used. My group also finds it problematic that the Council's draft disregards the principle of proportionality. In any case, the scope of application is not limited. Thus, this Convention is not only applicable to combating serious crime and organized crime. Nowhere does it even state that it refers only to criminal law. It is therefore entirely conceivable that the European Union will soon use a sledgehammer to crack a nut, and citizens' rights will vanish into thin air. Mr President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, which we are discussing today, contains minimum rules that are essential for effective and rapid cooperation between the various judicial and investigative bodies. It concerns service of document, the exchange of information, the temporary transfer of detainees, the return of property, the examination of witnesses by videoconference, investigations, including so-called covert investigations, telephone tapping, and much more. That is the minimum that could be agreed upon, although it must be said straight away that if certain amendments, such as Nos 32 or 81, or Nos 70 or 71 in their revised form, were to be adopted, the Convention as a whole would amount to a mere exchange of communications or information and could really be thrown in the wastepaper basket, which is why we would vote against it. I hope that colleagues from the various political groups will use their common sense and reject these amendments. The fact that it resulted in only a convention, not a framework agreement, is also a defeat for the European Parliament. Commissioner Vitorino will surely have gathered from all the various contributions how necessary it is to create a framework of common rules, rather than continuing with this disjointed regulation, these small agreements for individual areas such as investigations and the like. Rather, it is absolutely essential to create a minimum of secure, Community-wide rules, while, of course, increasing the guarantees as much as possible—also in view of enlargement. I can only imagine what would become of this Community, of these agreements, or of legal relations if, for example, a fascist country like Turkey were to join the European Union: I would be truly perplexed. We need, as everyone has emphasized, a corpus juris and, particularly in procedural law, common rules that guarantee a common rule of law throughout the Community. It is clear that this is a matter that must primarily be addressed by the Intergovernmental Conference, and that Parliament can only make a limited contribution to this objective, since everything depends on the Council and the Commission. I believe that this first six months, with the Commissioner responsible being Portuguese and Portugal holding the Council Presidency, offer an excellent opportunity to give initial impetus to this common objective.	de
However, I have noted your comments and will consider them further. Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me a question about the establishment of a positive list. This is one of the issues we are addressing in the annex to the legislation, and we intend to establish a positive list for substances intended for animal feed. At the moment, the list is, I would say, negative and is being completed as required. The establishment of a positive list is one of the issues raised in the annex and given a date, namely 2002. We have identified the rapid alert system for animal feed as a gap in the legislation. The rapid alert exists for food, not for animal feed. This is unfortunate and incorrect, and we believe it is important to highlight this, to establish legislation to close this gap, and this will be done. Work in relation to BSE within Member States and the establishment of random tests to assess infectivity levels in Member States is ongoing. I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has already asked me this question, and I replied that I thought it was progressing rapidly. However, I understand that the matter is at the stage of consultation between services within the Commission, and that work is currently underway. I hope that the next time you ask me, I will be able to provide you with more detailed information. Mrs Jackson highlighted the fact that there are 24 new pieces of legislation and 20 amending pieces of legislation. She also asked whether this adds to the overregulation. I would say that the pieces of legislation we have identified are intended to fill gaps in the current legislation. This is less about establishing new regimes or additional regulations, although that is part of it, than about identifying where the gaps and weak points are in the chain from stable to fork and filling them. Reference was made to the candidate countries, something we bear in mind. Food safety standards and, of course, other safety areas are obviously of crucial importance with regard to enlargement, and this is an issue to which I drew Mr Verheugen's attention. Commissioner, the ignorance of some Member States has plunged Europe into a major food crisis, and I am once again irritated, unfortunately, by the complete and repeated absence of the Council as you present this interesting report. I would really like you to tell me how you intend to ensure that this new authority, whatever its detailed name, will have influence over the Council, which will have its say within this authority, which will give the orders. It goes without saying that we cannot impose anything in terms of content, but I nevertheless insist on the fact that after Maastricht and Amsterdam, Parliament retains its right, and even develops it.	fr
"In today's debate, many words have been used that correspond to essential concepts of our time: globalization, the knowledge society, the relationship between the old economy and the new economy. All these words and the concepts underlying them can simultaneously correspond to opportunities and problems. And the imperative before us is to transform problems into opportunities and, above all, to avoid at all costs transforming opportunities into problems. Clearly, to achieve this, there are two essential issues in all spheres. First, a very strong investment in people and a crucial concept mentioned here today by so many of you: lifelong training and education are an investment in people, a crucial issue for all these issues to be transformed into opportunities for all. But, in addition to investment in people, there is also a need for regulatory capacity on the part of public authorities, whether national states, the European Union, or global authorities, to make indispensable entrepreneurial and personal initiative compatible with the conditions of social justice and equity. This is true in the sphere of globalization. Globalization is something that allows for greater increases in wealth, international trade, and productivity. But deregulated globalization, as it exists today, or globalization in which large sectors of the world's population lack a strong investment in people, is also a factor of exclusion, of division, of widening the gap between rich and poor. This is true in the knowledge society, which can provide new equality of opportunity, but it can also be a factor of increasingly clear separation between those who have access to it and those who do not, as occurs in the relationship between the old and the new economy. Furthermore, this is not the first time that a technological transition has changed the paradigm of society and the organization of the economy. And what has always happened in these moments of profound transition is that the problems of the old economy, particularly those of employment, are always resolved by resorting to the new economy and its instruments. I'll give you an example: in Europe, we have a textile industry, and we must continue to have it, but we will only have it if we can apply the technologies of the information society and the knowledge society. It is extraordinary that, at this moment, in the sectors of the so-called ""new economy,"" there is a shortage of almost 80,000 people suitable for existing jobs, just as there are millions of unemployed. This means that we have not yet been able to use the instruments of the new economy to solve the problems of the old economy, which will never be solved with the logic of that same old economy. Finally, I would like to answer a question that has been asked of me: whether I speak here on behalf of fifteen or fourteen countries. The answer is simple: I speak on behalf of fifteen countries. And one of the things that the Portuguese Presidency has guaranteed is Austria's full participation in the functioning of all the institutions of the Union."	es
"Mr Andersson will certainly be familiar with the phenomenon known as prohibition and also with the consequences it had for the activities of the American mafia. So much so that in the end it was decided to abolish prohibition. It is obvious that we must protect the health of the public, but not by prohibiting alcoholic beverages, because that obviously serves no purpose. Mr President, what is really at issue here is the revenue from the Swedish state monopoly on alcohol. When the Swedish Government says that it needs it to cover its health costs, it shows that we are dealing with a distortion of competition, since other countries have to finance their own health costs without having a monopoly on alcohol. My question is: are you also aware of studies which state that moderate consumption of high-quality alcoholic products such as French wine or Bavarian beer can even be healthy and that it could therefore even relieve the Swedish budget. I understand that Mr Posselt was referring to the fiscal aspects of the matter. And if I am not mistaken, the high excise duty on alcohol in Sweden dates back to 1638 and since then a large part of the state's tax revenue has come from the sale of alcohol. It is also known that there is currently a state monopoly in Sweden, which in itself is a violation of Union law. So, as far as the healing power of alcohol is concerned, that is what Mr Posselt was referring to if I understood correctly - I agree with him one hundred percent. In my opinion, a good bottle of wine can be very good for your health and in terms of social contacts it can be extremely pleasant. Perhaps Mr Posselt, Mr Andersson and I could meet up at the Parliament bar one of these days and have a glass of aquavit together. Mr President, I have followed the Commission's response with interest regarding the need to implement the Single Market legislation. I wonder if the Commissioner can tell me whether he considers his answer compatible with the fact that the Commission has not taken the French Government to the Court of Justice because of the application of the French ""Loi et Vin"" law which effectively prevents the application of single market legislation to the sale of alcohol in France. Can we expect the European Commission to bring an action against France before the Court of Justice? I would like to answer the Honourable Member's question very briefly, as the matter is currently before the Commission. The Commission must decide whether the matter is closed or whether it should be brought to the attention of the Court of Justice. My answer may not be satisfactory at the moment, but I would like to reassure the Honourable Member that the Commission will take a decision within a few weeks. I ask for the Honourable Member's understanding for this small delay in the Commission's decision. Commissioner, are there public health reasons which justify different tax rates, for example for Scotch whiskey rather than French Bordeaux wine or for my colleague's Bavarian beer?"	it
"The truly substantial difference concerns the charging of waste disposal costs. My colleague Bouwman has already touched on this aspect. There are two experiences in this area. The Baltic Sea experience, which is therefore not only a national experience but an experience of the entire Baltic basin, according to which, by largely including the costs of disposal in general port charges, the disposal of ships' waste at sea is no longer encouraged. Once paid, it is better to provide for waste disposal in the port. The second system is based on the pure ""polluter pays"" principle: ships that unload waste are required to pay an additional amount. This second system has proven ineffective, otherwise why would the Mediterranean be so dirty? Why is the North Sea so dirty? Because the ""polluter pays"" principle, without adequate controls, does not work! This is why a large majority in the committee - not a large majority and now the representatives of the minority opinion will speak - reiterated the thesis approved at first reading by Parliament without any conflict, namely that the best system is the no special fee system, since, in a certain sense, it offers ships an economic incentive not to throw waste into the sea and to deposit it in the appropriate port collection facilities. This is the crucial point. We are willing to reach an agreement with the Council, but up to now the Council has refused any serious agreement with us. I therefore appeal to this House to recommend the adoption of our amendment in which we ask for up to 90 percent of the costs to be covered by port charges. In this way we would have the possibility of reaching an agreement with the Council in conciliation, either on 75 percent or on another percentage. I also appeal to the Commission: Madam Vice-President, be careful which side you intend to take! I believe that, in the interests of environmental protection and of a sustainable and thriving tourism industry in many countries of the Community, an effective system is better. Please support our no special fee system, perhaps then we can reach a reasonable compromise with the Council in conciliation. Mr President, I am pleased that you are chairing this debate, because I know that, as a Bavarian, you always pay a lot of attention to issues relating to ports and the sea. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Theo Bouwman, for his work and his cooperation in preparing for tomorrow's vote. Tomorrow we will have to decide on a couple of points. Firstly, we know that the transport of people and goods by ship is the most environmentally friendly mode of transport compared to other modes of transport. At the same time, however, we also know that ships contribute significantly to marine pollution, through waste, cargo residues and sludge. Ship fuel is heavy oil and we know that 1-3 percent of this heavy oil remains in the form of sludge, which is usually discharged into the sea."	it
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, who has spent several hours in this Chamber working with the Members of the European Parliament, whether he has gained any idea of their worth in terms of remuneration. Honourable Member, as this debate on the European Parliament's fees is not exclusive to your country and even extends to my country, I have a precise idea of how much the fees of Members of the European Parliament amount to. I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem. Mr. President, I appreciate the answer. I would like to ask a complementary question that bears some similarity to Mr. Sjöstedt's. We are both Swedish. In our country, the largest tax is the municipal tax, since services are local and plentiful. There are problems related to trust in politicians, and, to a no lesser extent, in European politicians in Parliament. How do you think trust in us politicians would be affected if we were granted the right to use services in the places where we live—schools, welfare, etc.—but, at the same time, we didn't pay taxes, didn't contribute? How do you think a system of this nature would influence trust in us? This is a question, Mr. President-in-Office of the Council, that I don't know if you are obliged to answer because it is truly philosophical. But if you want to delve into the realm of philosophy, go ahead! No, Mr. President, I am not tempted to enter the realm of philosophy. These are fundamental issues related to the very foundation of the status of Members and their role within the framework of political society. I do not wish to enter into that kind of debate because it seems to me that it could—to use a French expression—prejudice the interpretation that the Portuguese Presidency makes within the framework of the negotiations, in which it is immersed, on the status of Members. I would like to ask that you allow me not to make any comments in advance. As the time allocated for Question Time to the Council has expired, Questions 11 to 35 will be answered in writing. Question Time to the Council is now closed. (The sitting, adjourned at 7:05 p.m., resumes at 9:00 p.m.) Address by Mr. Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the European Parliament, I have the great honor of extending a warm welcome to Mr. Václav Havel, President of the Czech Republic. I would also like to extend a welcome to Mrs. Havel, who has taken a place in the gallery. Madam, you are welcome. (Applause) This is not the first time we have welcomed you to our Parliament, Mr. President. You already spoke before the House in Strasbourg in March 1994, almost six years ago, and many of us have very vivid memories of it, namely those of our colleagues who were already members at that time. Indeed, just after the Maastricht Treaty came into force, you spoke out in favor of strengthening European values, creating a European ethical dimension, and opening the Union to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.	es
I am not saying that we should not increase the level of specialisation of workers in the sector - of course we should - but first we must allow jobs to be created. The availability of unskilled, temporary and seasonal work is very important in some economic sectors of the Community. Tourism contributes to regional development in rural areas that are trying to diversify and to that of urban areas that are trying to highlight the importance of their cultural heritage. Taking all these aspects together we can really do something in Europe and perhaps we can extend the tourist season by staggering holidays on our continent. We must not forget that with enlargement we will have the opportunity to increase the number of tourists coming to Europe to visit those monuments of our cultural heritage that for many years - about forty - have not been open to the public. We are losing market share, and I think something must be done to make us more competitive. So I hope you will help us. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are dealing with a very important sector, which directly employs more than 10 million people in the EU and which helps the more or less disadvantaged regions, as well as the most remote and island areas, to get by. Tourism creates an additional number of jobs, helping to consolidate employment, especially for the most vulnerable sections of society, namely women and young people. In the light of these data, I think that the lack of a European policy for tourism constitutes a serious contradiction. The absence of a legal basis makes it impossible to adopt measures in this sector. The occasional use of Article 308 (ex 235), which requires unanimity, has prevented the approval of a five-year programme worth ECU 8 million for all fifteen Member States. : The measures adopted sporadically in the past have been fragmented and ineffective, and their provisions have been dictated by parallel policies in the areas of, for example, consumer protection, the environment, transport, taxes, etc.; these were policies that not only did not help tourism but actually hindered it, since their application often implied a cost for the tourism sector, without any detailed consideration of how to help or encourage it. I must stress with regret that today, in the context of the restructuring of the Commission's services, tourism is only a sector - and not a directorate - within the Directorate-General for Enterprise. In my opinion, our tourism should instead be supported and the pillars for such support could be the following: adding a chapter dedicated to tourism in the revision that will give a legal basis to the sector; developing a common tourism policy that will support the sector without disrupting the functioning of the relevant market; coordination between tourism policy and other parallel common policies that directly or indirectly influence it; study of the sector and adoption of medium and long-term measures to help the competitiveness of the tourism product.	it
The history of the Joint Assembly clearly demonstrates a positive development in this regard. While ACP countries were previously represented at meetings by members of government, senior officials, or ambassadors, today more than three-quarters of our interlocutors are elected parliamentarians. We must celebrate when we soon reach 100% representation, as the new agreement seeks. Progress in democratization processes, which, unlike the various outbreaks of crises, occur discreetly, unfortunately goes too unnoticed. A specific element of ACP multilateral collaboration is regional cooperation and integration. This will fulfill one of the Parliament's long wish lists. The Joint Assembly will soon hold meetings at the regional level. We have already heard this. Strengthening regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts for ethnic, economic, social, or religious reasons; in other words, it can have a preventive effect. For the same reason, the European Parliament has promoted civil society participation in decision-making processes and the management of cooperation from the outset and has highlighted the significance of decentralized collaboration. The intensification of contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners, provided for in the new agreement, represents a further step in the right direction. Only a trace of sadness remains that the European Development Assistance Fund is not yet integrated into the EU budget. I hope we will not have to wait another 25 years until we achieve our goal in this regard. Mr. President, allow me to congratulate Mr. Corrie on his report. The Lomé Convention has attested to a genuine partnership between the EU and the ACP countries for more than 25 years, and the fact that it has continued despite the overwhelming pressure against it from many organizations, including the WTO, represents a true triumph. However, it is obvious that the new Convention should not be evaluated by its mere existence, but by how it can contribute to the EU's commitment to eradicating poverty and achieving international development goals. If we apply this criterion, we will realize that the new agreements have several shortcomings: for example, the agreement is quite disappointing for ACP countries that suffer short-term fluctuations in their export earnings. In December, during a marathon round of negotiations, an agreement was reached to provide aid to island, landlocked, and least-developed countries when they suffer losses of at least 2% in their export earnings, while the 10% threshold would continue to apply to other ACP countries. However, at the end of the negotiations, the EU claimed that it had never given its approval to include island and landlocked countries among the candidates deserving of aid based on the 2% threshold. This change has had devastating consequences, especially for the Windward Islands, which is possibly the only ACP country that will actually lose out under the new arrangements.	es
And all this must be done with the European citizen in mind. It must be done with the men and women who work and live their daily lives in our countries in mind. The extraordinary summit in Lisbon must fundamentally reconfirm in the European citizen the idea that the European Union remains faithful to a society aimed at promoting integration and social cohesion. Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency has the merit of focusing the debate on issues which, while not new, are set in a new way with courageous objectives, starting with the urgency of addressing the issue of competitive capacity based on innovation and permanent technological democratisation, given that the technological development of the United States is the result of a very dynamic private initiative but also of the military sector and a certain protectionism. It is also necessary to evaluate the case of Japan, from which Europe could draw lessons on the organisation of work, on the responsibility of the State and companies - and also of the worker himself - with regard to business objectives. We must draw inspiration from these two models for useful aspects such as entrepreneurial capacity and work organisation, maintaining the best of Europe, its social model suited to a post-industrial economy. The fact is that Europe needs 32 million jobs to reach the levels of the United States, we need an increase in female employment, the integration of marginalised groups, the strengthening of social cohesion (a problem that the Structural Funds have not yet resolved), the inclusion of five million long-term unemployed, largely due to industrial reconversions, we need new specialisations because access to technology is not a tacit guarantee of quality of employment and entrepreneurial initiative. We need greater participation and responsibility from the social partners, new actors, as stated in the Pintassilgo report, to create pacts for employment and business competitiveness. We need to resolve the problems of poverty and we need a social model suited to the new conditions. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your proposal is courageous, although it does not depend directly on you but on the Fifteen. As regards the question of Austria, I would very much like this country to be part of the group of States that will make this proposal of yours a reality. However, if it did so, Austria would be deceiving and lying to the voters of part of its government. I hope it will do so, however! Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the statement that we live in a globalised world is a statement that our fellow citizens, regardless of their level of education or their ideology, have heard many times. However, more rarely do we hear what the role of Europe should be in this context of the information society, globalisation and technology. I happen to think, Mr President, that this is probably because perhaps we Europeans have a perception of Europe that is sometimes a little distant from our closest concerns and interests. The first concern of European citizens, after health, is probably work.	it
"I hope that what we have said so forcefully today will also find greater support in the Commission's documents. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the greatest legacy the Commission could leave to the European Union would be to reorganise and redistribute the increasingly chaotic and confusing powers and competences of the Executive and perhaps of the Union itself. You have taken a courageous first step by stressing, rightly, the need to focus on so-called ""core activities"". As you yourself said today, this means identifying the tasks, policies and programmes that are marginal or irrelevant to the Commission's primary vocation. Many current European Union policies and programmes have probably already passed their use-by date, or have proven difficult to manage or ineffective at European level. The challenge today is to find the courage to delegate as many non-core activities as possible to a lower level of government, be it national, regional or local. If we are to convince the sceptical European public of the merits of further European integration, we must be able to demonstrate that we are as committed to the downward delegation of unjustified European competences as we are to the granting of new powers to the European Union. We must not allow the critics of European integration to argue, as they do now with some justification - we have heard this from Mr Bonde - that the proliferation of Community responsibilities is a one-way street. We must demonstrate that it is a two-way process, in which Union policies and programmes that are not fully justified on the basis of subsidiarity and proportionality are being delegated and abandoned. If we can match these aspirations with concrete action in the coming years, we will make an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole, and, as we have heard today, you will benefit from a broad consensus in this Parliament. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I fully support the logic of the proposals by my colleague Heidi Hautala regarding the strategic objectives of the Commission for the next five years. For my part, I will speak on a subject that has not been addressed, although it was foreseen, namely the Commission's work programme for the year 2000. I am aware of the limitations of the operation: working within the framework of the Treaty in force, we must abide by its rules. I am thinking in particular of an important subject, namely the fiscal issue, but I do not want to talk about fiscal aspects. Instead, I will begin by welcoming some of the proposals in the programme for the year 2000. I am thinking of all the ambitious and important proposals on food safety and also on shipping safety, following the two oil spills that hit the coasts of Brittany and Turkey. It is good that the Commission is reacting quickly on this. On the other hand, in other areas I believe that we could be more ambitious and move forward more quickly. I would like to put forward a series of positive proposals regarding, for example, social issues, the environment and the follow-up to Seattle."	it
Among the most vulnerable, it is important that I speak on this point, are migrants and refugees. Thus, the almost systematic conditions of detention and the criminalization of asylum seekers are no longer acceptable. Every asylum seeker must have the right to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensive effect. Last week, somewhat by chance, I witnessed at Roissy-en-France airport a scene of unusual violence in which two young women, undoubtedly clandestine, were returned to Conakry. They were treated like the worst criminals. They were naked, dragged along the ground by their hair, and escorted by a horde of CRS (Refugee Refugees). The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this kind of barbaric acts. Our role, on the contrary, is to accompany, reassure, and assist those fleeing dictatorships. The Commission proposed the creation of a European refugee fund. Parliament was very much in favor of it. Instead of vacillating over the budget allocated to this fund, I believe you can decide to implement it. The Presidency and the Council can implement what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though Tampere constituted an important base. Similarly, we cannot be content with observing the rise of xenophobic currents in Europe, the trivialization of discrimination, without adopting significant measures. Harmonization of anti-racism legislation is essential. What meaning do you intend to give to Article 13 of the Treaty? What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in pay between men and women? How do you hope to work towards the eradication of homophobia, racism, and sexism? We must take the best of what is already being done in each of the countries of the Union. When six European countries grant the right to vote, their president can afford to extend that right to vote and eligibility in municipal and European elections to all non-EU citizens who have resided in European territory for more than five years. Thus, the regularization of undocumented immigrants in some countries, including yours, must become an example for others, since these undocumented immigrants currently constitute a mass of people weakened by the merchants of dreams and a workforce subject to personal services and economic exploitation that turns them into modern-day slaves. More generally, this Presidency must initiate a change in the behavior and relationships of our fellow citizens with minorities and immigrants. Immigration is too often synonymous with insecurity and violence, and the responses are purely repressive. How do you intend to make our fellow citizens understand that today, as always, immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth, whose role is and will continue to be indispensable in the demographic context we know today? What action is necessary to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and guarantee genuine protection for asylum seekers? Mr. President, there is a great lack of transparency in the areas of security, freedom, and justice. The European Union is an economic marvel, but we are in no position to pontificate when it comes to the treatment of refugees. The level of racism in our society is terrifying.	es
We would, however, like to stress the essential need to adopt the strategy for the new millennium as soon as possible, which will give new impetus and continuity to the work carried out under the previous action plan. Furthermore, in the area of judicial cooperation, important progress has been made on the euro's criminal law protection, and a framework decision of fundamental and strategic importance is currently being discussed in the European Parliament. We believe that, in order to be credible, the euro's criminal law protection requires that we avoid a proliferation of instruments and, therefore, make a joint effort to be able to adopt a single instrument in March covering all the issues to be addressed, both those consisting of initiatives already presented by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself has expressly identified as necessary. In this area, it is important that measures for the mutual recognition of judicial decisions be implemented, and we believe that, thanks to the work already done, steps towards the mutual recognition of decisions will soon be taken, at least in the area of the seizure of goods. Finally, with regard to Europol, which only began its effective work in 1999 and prompted the Council to adopt a series of instruments, known to Parliament, to enable it to operate, a fundamental question still remains, relating to the democratic and judicial control of Europol. These issues are, of course, given a new dimension by the political option adopted at Tampere to broaden Europol's remit and, above all, to give it an operational dimension. The French Presidency has submitted to us an important working document setting out various scenarios for discussing and resolving the issues of democratic and judicial control of Europol. The Portuguese Presidency will take the initiative to present a working document on the Eurojust network shortly. Although it is clearly not necessary for judicial oversight of Europol to be carried out through Eurojust, it cannot currently be ruled out that this may become an alternative course of action in the future. Therefore, it is now particularly important that the Council debate on the development of Europol and Eurojust take place simultaneously, so that the appropriate conclusions can be reached simultaneously. I believe that in this area, and in the dialogue that the Council and Parliament must inevitably have on the development of Europol and Eurojust, we have the opportunity to find an institutionally acceptable solution for relations between the Council and Parliament in relation to Europol. We know Parliament's positions and we know that Parliament knows the positions of the Council's legal services. By resolving the issue of democratic oversight of Europol, I believe that this problem will find a definitive solution, and also a solution that mobilizes and strengthens interinstitutional cooperation between all. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Council, I must first say that, without wishing to compete emotionally with the Ministers, I am not moved but confused by having, for the first time, two personal friends in the Presidency, and I sincerely hope that this does not undermine the separation of powers, which is essential to the functioning of our Union.	de
The road has been very long, especially due to the legal problem that arose regarding the extent to which the Community could be considered to have full jurisdiction over intellectual property issues. This problem has been overcome. Today, we must essentially give our assent to two treaties: the Intellectual Property Treaty and the Treaty on Performances and Phonograms. Regarding the former, it appears to effectively resolve the claims of authors of artistic and literary works, while creating the framework for protection in matters of distribution, rental, and presentation of their works to the public. Regarding the latter treaty on performances and phonograms, we must emphasize that for the first time, the exclusive rights of performers and artists for production, distribution, and rental to the public, as well as the right to fair remuneration for broadcasting, are recognized by an international treaty, also signed by the Community. Within this framework, it is worth noting the great progress that the treaty represents in the area of the right of reproduction. Although, as the Commission points out, the treaty texts do not contain special provisions regulating all the additional issues that arise with technological development, it can nevertheless be stated that within this legislative framework being created, performers enjoy broader protection than that derived from the Treaty of Rome or even from Community directives. An interpretation of Article 7 of the Treaty leads us to the conclusion that the application of protection against reproduction does not only mean protection against the reproduction of the performances themselves or of the performances incorporated into phonograms, but also protection against copying, whether partial or total, permanent or ephemeral, as well as protection of all types of production. However, it would be useful to address some points that should be the focus of future work at WIPO or other diplomatic conferences. First, this concerns the right of distribution, as referred to in Article 8, paragraph 1. The possibility given to States, from the next section of the same article, to regulate the exercise of the aforementioned right is dangerous and constitutes one of the most negative aspects of the Treaty, since there is nothing to prevent Member States from approving special conditions for exercising this right, something that will have negative consequences for artists. Regarding the right of rental, the interpretation of Article 9 leads us to the conclusion that only artists or performers enjoy the exclusive right of rental, as long as it is provided for in national legislation, and I believe there is a difference here compared to Article 13. Finally, I would like to say that the ratification of these treaties opens horizons for the right of property. For the 21st century, the century of knowledge and the intangible economy, intellectual property will be a fundamental form of property and, in many cases, more important than traditional property.	es
"Mr. President, the place of women in politics is an important issue that deserves better than the politically correct overtaking we are witnessing. Undoubtedly, not many women participate in politics. It is not true that the predominance of men in party apparatuses is the only reason that should be invoked. In France, 95% of those elected are city councilors. Most of them are not affiliated with any party. In departmental bodies, the first party in France is that of those elected without a label, those who represent various parties of the left or right. To be elected as a local councilor, it is enough to want to be elected, and the possibility of assuming national responsibilities often depends on the establishment offered by these mandates. Our Group wishes to promote fair representation of men and women in the bodies of the European Union. That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether expressed in favor of women or even so-called social minorities. Minority politics, by downplaying the profound unity of the human family in favor of establishing superficial divisions, dangerously threatens the cohesion of society and the balance of our democratic model. On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why wouldn't we also establish quotas based on age or ethnicity—quotas for Catholics, workers, or people who wear glasses? Applying social quotas for the most modest categories would be no more absurd than creating quotas for women. With this philosophy, it would no longer be necessary to organize elections or administrative competitions. It would be enough to determine the composition of ministries and chambers through statistical calculations. Quota politics can only increase voters' lack of interest in politics and give them the impression that everything happens behind their backs. On the other hand, this policy demonstrates a profound contempt for women. It is not through the mechanical game of a certain quota that women should access political or administrative functions, but through the recognition of their own merit and skills. Ladies, would you have so little pride as to be willing to hold a ministerial portfolio or a parliamentary sash for the mathematical contingency of a quota? Women are worth much more than a quota. It is by restoring the principle of ""meritocracy"" that we will improve the quantity and quality of women's presence in the decision-making process. I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their interventions and the important statements they made before the European Parliament on such a crucial issue as the one we are debating today. The presence of women in decision-making positions is above all a matter of democracy. All citizens, men and women, need to recognize themselves and feel truly represented by their elected officials and their leaders."	es
For this reason, we warmly welcome these programs. I would like to refer to the positions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs regarding the largest of the Community initiatives, namely INTERREG III. It is essential that a considerable number of social measures also be promoted within the framework of INTERREG III. Given the fact that 50% of unemployment in the Union is structurally determined, and given the particularly sensitive situation in border territories—I wish to refer only to possible unwanted migratory movements—this is not only reasonable but also imperative. However, the measures that can be promoted and are mentioned in Annex II of Guideline A seem to hold much promise in this regard. However, the Commission communication completely lacks instructions to the Member States containing these integrated approaches to aspects of social and employment policy. For this reason, I would like to pay special attention to the gradual adoption of vocational training measures, especially in areas affected by high levels of long-term and youth unemployment. Guideline B should also be open to employment policy promotion measures, especially in connection with the introductory strategy for the candidates for accession. With regard to employment policy measures, I believe it is generally necessary to establish the Joint Cooperation Committee at the regional level, because only at the regional level are there the experience and familiarity that are precisely necessary for these measures, so that they do not fade into something abstract. We can always criticize the fact that INTERREG—as I also believe—still remains excessive in terms of administrative burden, but we must always criticize it, although this seems almost inevitable to me in the case of the Commission's promotion programs. However, I would like to point out that this is fatal precisely here. For employment policy, we should strive for the simplest possible measures so that the social dimension in this EU regains its rightful importance. Mr. President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism considered, among other things, the report on LEADER+ and, in this regard, agreed to support the decentralization process in the management of actions, considering that such a process can be effective if two conditions are met: that local action groups are representative of the general interests of the local community and that the Commission's oversight mechanisms are used to prevent territorial and local political authorities from using LEADER+ resources to maintain civil organizations and groups linked to those powers. It is requested that equal representation of three components be guaranteed in the decision-making bodies of the projects: political representatives and public administrations, businesses and economic operators, and social actors, including trade unions and non-governmental organizations. It is especially emphasized that, in all these bodies, there must be a balanced representation of men and women.	es
It is for this reason that the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on the information and consultation of workers in November 1998. We thank Parliament for its support for this proposal since then. Unfortunately, more than a year after the proposal was presented, the other branch of the legislative branch, the Council, has still not started work on this proposal. I hope that this debate will help to remind Member States of the importance and urgency of this initiative. We recently heard the Portuguese Presidency state that a serious debate would soon be launched on this proposal. The next Presidency, which will be held by France, also seems willing to give this dossier the priority it deserves. The Commission sincerely hopes that Parliament and the Council will quickly finalize this important dossier, which, in its view, constitutes the most effective response to the concerns raised by cases such as the one that brings us here today. As regards the involvement of employees at transnational level, there are some indications of at least one case of infringement of transnational consultation and information agreements between companies and the European workforce. It may be that the companies concerned have taken advantage of certain ambiguities in the existing legal and contractual framework. The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to determine the outcome. In any case, I would like to inform anyone who believes their rights have been violated that they have adequate means of enforcement and redress, including through the relevant national courts. The Commission has heard Parliament's call for an immediate review of the European Works Councils Directive. As indicated in the report it will adopt in the coming weeks, the Commission accepts that the directive has certain shortcomings. However, as my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, has already pointed out on various other occasions, the decision whether or not to revise a directive immediately is not an easy one. It depends on several considerations. First, a revision of the Directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting party autonomy ceased to apply. Second, an immediate revision would risk delaying progress on other pending dossiers in this area, such as the European public limited company and the proposal on national information and consultation. The success of these other dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the EWC Directive and even provide some possible solutions to the problems identified above. Therefore, the Commission believes that it would be better, in this context, to proceed with the revision of the European Works Council Directive after these two other dossiers have been completed and after a more thorough assessment of the application of the Directive. The review does not stop at legislation alone. To encourage and support dialogue as a cornerstone of successful change, the Commission is putting into practice the recommendations of the Lillehammer report by preparing the creation of a European observatory of industrial change.	fr
The neighborhoods where these people live should benefit from these projects. If we succeed in doing this by defining three priorities, then I believe that these families, these people, these European citizens will believe more in Europe, and that is ultimately crucial, because cities are playing an increasingly large role in European life. Mr President, before my colleagues Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou have their say—after all, all three of us responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow the debate with equal attention—I would like to turn to URBAN and INTERREG. Many of you have raised this issue and expressed your views on it. First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs of the committees, all the committees, but also the speakers from the political groups and each and every one of you for the quality of their contributions and the interest they express in these two initiatives. This applies in particular to Mrs Arlene McCarthy's comments on URBAN, and I would like to thank her not only for her work and the report she has presented, but also - and why not mention this too - for what we owe her, what you owe her with regard to this initiative, as well as for what we owe your Parliament in general. I shall not forget that the European Parliament voted and wished to maintain this initiative to regenerate urban areas in crisis and to promote sustainable urban development, which also includes the integrated approach to tackling economic, social and environmental problems that we favour. There is also agreement, as Mrs Arlene McCarthy set out in her report, on the effectiveness of this instrument, resulting from the financial concentration and critical mass of interventions; on the horizontal mechanism, which we believe is particularly suitable for disseminating results and intensifying the exchange of experience and good practice; and, finally, on the growing role of local authorities in the preparation and implementation of programmes on the basis of a solid partnership. After reminding you of the similarities between the Commission's proposals and those of your Parliament and expressing the interest with which I have followed the contributions, I would like to respond to some of the criticisms and suggestions that have been made, apologising in advance for not being able to mention every speaker personally. However, I am sure that everyone will recognise what I have said. I should first like to refer to the URBAN programme and its ceiling of 50 towns, which some of you have described as arbitrary. I understand your concerns. I have therefore instructed my departments to prepare for a reasonable increase in the number of cities eligible for URBAN funding. This requires certain guarantees regarding concentration – I am thinking here in particular of intervention areas with at least 20,000 inhabitants, and in exceptional cases, more than 10,000 – and critical financial mass. We must maintain the level of €500 per inhabitant so that the European Union's intervention is both effective and visible, and not perceived as a scattergun approach that citizens and municipalities can no longer understand.	de
To ask for greater appropriations for this element in these conditions, as paragraph 20 does, contributes to the irresponsible and ideological budgetary excesses to which this House is accustomed. Finally, we note the desire expressed both in the Commission document and in the report by Mrs Decourrière to use INTERREG for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans: I do not believe that the Structural Funds should be used to repair the damage inflicted by the Americans on Serbia during the criminal and ineffective bombing. It should be up to Washington, and not us, to assume responsibility for a conflict unleashed to serve its own interests alone. For these reasons, the French delegation in our group was unable to support the Decourrière report, choosing to abstain at the time of the final vote. Procacci report (A5-0025/2000) Mr President, I voted in favour of the Procacci report on rural development, not only because I agree with the LEADER programme in its most important aspects but also because it is the other side of the URBAN programme, which we spoke about earlier. Just as older people in cities are very lonely, older people in rural areas are becoming the only population, because young people are going to the city: they are fascinated by the lights, by the pubs too, and the countryside and rural areas remain empty. I therefore believe it is very important that this European Union project should find universal support and be further strengthened. The LEADER + Community initiative, while giving continuity to the previous ones, has some special features. Firstly, the reduction of around half of the funds available, although the period is longer. In the meantime, new objectives have been included, notably the financing of the Natura 2000 network and all rural regions become eligible. Although this Community initiative is aimed at rural development, it is unacceptable that it does not address agriculture and agricultural production in a coherent manner. Without agriculture, the rural world does not exist and consequently any rural development strategy must be based on the endogenous potential of agriculture while increasing other activities, upstream and downstream, to avoid the desertification of the rural world. For this reason, we considered it essential to improve the relationship with the proposals we have presented to expressly include agricultural activity and farmers in the rural development strategy, to request an increase in funding in order not to jeopardise the continuation of the programme in the rural regions previously covered and to argue that the new programme must continue to give priority to the most disadvantaged regions. Our position on LEADER is the result of our general assessment of the overall agricultural policy conducted by the Union. Both LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, applied in the 1990s, were an essential component of the new CAP resulting from the 1992 reform and, together with other individual measures, constituted the so-called second pillar of the rural development policy implemented by the Union. Their real objective was to alleviate and conceal the disastrous consequences of the new CAP, as well as to disorientate small and medium-sized farmers, and certainly not to develop rural areas and maintain the agricultural population there, as was instead hypocritically proclaimed among the objectives of these programmes.	it
However, I would like to warn you against the illusion that the inconsistency is the product of some kind of mechanical deficiency in the system. It may be, but that inconsistency is only a small part of what we are discussing now. Most of these inconsistencies have to do with known and well-established differences in interests between men and women, etc., and therein lies the problem. Mr. Mulder has said that no farmer will start producing anything whose price is too low. That is true for our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective. In those countries, farming is not just for earning a living, but for living, and that is the difference. Subsistence farming is not based on any price calculations; it is based on the hope that it will rain during the next season. That does not apply to all agriculture in developing countries but to an agriculture aimed at reducing poverty, in which we must intervene more and better than we have done so far. From that perspective, what I'm saying is very pertinent. Other issues have been mentioned: livestock in Namibia, tomatoes, and powdered milk in the Caribbean. Let's not be excessively masochistic. There's a limit to the usefulness of everything. All the cases mentioned are characterized by the fact that we have addressed them. Intervention prices have been regulated, and the problems we had with cattle in West Africa and Namibia were resolved by reducing support for intervention. These were real problems, but we have resolved them all. As for the issue of cocoa, or chocolate, I repeat that 5% of it has to do with creating a livelihood in neighboring countries. What we're talking about are local cocoa nuts, which are as important to the people who harvest them to earn a living in Burkina Faso as coconuts are to farmers in Ghana. This isn't a clear case of inconsistency; it's more a case of competition between suppliers. What has been said about sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated. Within the framework of overseas countries and territories, the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem, but it may well be that what we are mentioning here has more to do with promoting the interests of some European companies than with generating income in the Caribbean. Be that as it may, this is an issue we are addressing. I have undertaken to try to create the right balance in all these issues, and I will allow myself to mention the achievement of the trade cooperation and development agreement with South Africa. I will say, in all modesty, that this example is something that indicates that the Commission is prepared to make an additional effort to achieve coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of commercial interests. There is no doubt that we have done everything necessary to resolve this problem, and I sincerely hope that we will now have a period of tranquility and peaceful implementation of that agreement in the coming years.	es
"And this requires generating a growth dynamic that guarantees, for the European Union as a whole, a sustained average annual growth rate of at least 3%. I therefore believe it is necessary to stimulate a culture of dynamism and entrepreneurial initiative and a culture of strengthening social cohesion. All of this is absolutely necessary: technological change and institutional reforms. If it is necessary to learn more quickly from good practices, it is also necessary to create new, appropriate practices and innovate in terms of political methodology. And Europe, of course, today has the organized institutional processes to develop these policies, to achieve an economy and, above all, a society based on innovation and knowledge, through the design of a European policy for the information and knowledge society, the construction of a European-wide educational society, and the development of a European science and technology area open to the world. In conclusion, Mr. President, we must guarantee a combination of policies that boost growth and employment, ensure macroeconomic stability, and the consolidation of the euro. that foster growth and the transition towards a society and economy of innovation and knowledge. Through the role of structural policies and reforms, serving citizens, we will have a closer Europe and, of course, a stronger Europe. Mr. President, I would like to join in all the congratulations on the ambitions of the Portuguese Presidency at this extraordinary Summit. I particularly welcome the intention to achieve real coordination of socioeconomic policy in all its scope. However, I would like to ask for attention to three specific points. The first point is the issue of corporate governance. The Portuguese Presidency has explicitly put the social dimension of innovation on the agenda, but it seems to me that this dimension is too far removed from the intentions regarding the promotion of new businesses. In my opinion, this social dimension must be integrated into this new European business, whether it is a large multinational or one of these small ICT start-ups. Therefore, I would like to reopen the debate on corporate governance, focusing on the broader concept of the company as a ""stakeholder society,"" including the role of the social partners and all those involved. On the last page of the Presidency document, I find the proposal to launch an ""observatory for industrial change."" I predict a significant role for such an observatory and would like to see this pursued vigorously. I would like to ask UNICE, the European employers' organization, to show a little more commitment and enthusiasm in this regard. I was annoyed that in their documents for this Summit, they mainly presented lists of demands on the administrations but failed to highlight their own commitment and their role in the entire process. I think we need to give it a try: they should collaborate with these activities. Another point I would like to mention briefly is fiscal coordination, because I don't think I have time to address all three."	es
However, before the opening of debates or when the session is suspended, there is nothing to stop you from drawing back the curtain to admire for a moment, free of charge, the magnificent spectacle that apparently lies behind it. I am pleased that the House is illuminated by the richness of the debates, but in my opinion it would be even better if, from time to time, the sun could shine directly on the Chamber. It would therefore be appreciated if you could check with the ushers whether it is possible to open the curtain from time to time. Thank you, Mr President. I am grateful for any suggestions aimed at making our meeting room more liveable. I would like to make the following proposal: for the time being, let us continue the work in the room as it is. In the meantime, we will check whether this is technically feasible. If so, we will do a half-hour test to see what effect it has on the President against the light. OICVM Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I trust that Parliament is ready to take a decision today that will strengthen the European financial market. As a new Member of the European Parliament, I found it extremely interesting and instructive to take on the responsibility of such an important issue. I would particularly like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their willingness to compromise, for the attention shown by the Chair and the Bureau to the complexity of the matter, for the good contacts established with the Commission, not least with the Commissioner, and with the Council, and for the dedicated work carried out by the secretariat of the parliamentary committee. The degree of agreement in the committee was remarkable, except on one point for which I am confident that a solution can be found. The issue of UCITS can be considered technically complex and politically risky. I think that some people do not even know the meaning of this acronym. But let me make it clear that this is an issue that really concerns the European citizen, because it concerns the way in which their savings are managed, the options available, the ways in which countries compete for different forms of savings, the needs of savers in terms of security and the opportunities for European citizens to save wisely in preparation for old age. These are all issues that require a careful balance between the need for liberalisation for a better market and higher returns on the one hand, and the need for investor protection and security on the other. During the 1980s, most European markets underwent a drastic process of deregulation. This resulted in the rapid development of national money and bond markets over a period of several years. Collective investment funds have become an alternative to bank savings. In my country, over 60 percent of Swedes have placed their savings in funds of one kind or another. Managed savings provide a certain level of security precisely because of the size of the investments made by the funds. The capital and investment securities market has continued to expand and the UCITS Directive currently in force has become outdated and no longer up to date.	it
In my view, this assessment should be contrasted with a picture of economic stagnation and low growth - equal, for the 1990s, to only 1.9 percent per year, despite some peaks that we have not been able to consolidate. Consequently, if we do not want to relive the failures of the past, we must take advantage of the current situation to improve economic performance and promote a new policy of transition towards higher levels of growth for our economy. This is the challenge that awaits us. In this respect, the Commission has essentially suggested that we stick to our past positions in relation to economic policy, limiting ourselves to establishing the fundamental fiscal and monetary principles for our economy, looking with confidence to the markets and hoping for a miracle from them without foreseeing further intervention by conscious social actors. In Europe, according to the rapporteur, this is precisely the attitude that has made us fail in the past - and not just once, but repeatedly - and entails the risks of downsizing that the ECOFIN Council is currently discussing. These risks include the correction of the US economy and the future path of oil prices and long-term interest rates in the Union. If one of these risks materializes, how will we respond? With more liberalism or better preparedness than when the last downturn occurred? My proposal asked Parliament to suggest an active economic policy in two ways. On the one hand, it recommended taking the Commission's excellent econometric analysis and asking the Council to turn it into an action plan with some quantifiable and interconnected targets for employment and economic growth, targets that would transform our commitment into an operational and credible full employment policy. One of the cornerstones of this plan was to increase the level of investment in capital creation from 19 percent - the level reached over the last decade - to at least 23-24 percent of GDP, both in the public and private sectors. In order to allow the public sector to take the lead in investment policy, the Council would have to sacrifice some of its most sacred cows. It should have revised its negative attitude towards the large trans-European network infrastructure programmes that have been gathering dust in drawers for too long, allowed these programmes to be adequately financed through EU bonds, and accepted an interpretation of the concept of budget deficit that would allow governments to borrow for investment without falling victim to the restrictions of the Stability Pact. This was the first key aspect of my proposal. The second aspect was to embrace a large number of proposals for structural reform, privatisation and deregulation and to facilitate the transition to a knowledge-based economy which, as we know, is the cornerstone of the Presidency's proposals for the Lisbon Summit. Experts have repeatedly said that the structural reform plan in conjunction with an expansion programme of investment and growth could awaken the European economy from its state of inertia, while unilateral policies are doomed to fail.	it
"There are also very concrete issues at stake, such as transport capacities. These things must be coordinated more quickly within the European Union. Another example: the large-scale cattle slaughter in Mongolia. We know that funds are available in the European Union through the TACIS and ECHO programs. But why aren't we helping? Because there are too many bureaucratic obstacles. The European Union's external representation must better reflect our need for a stronger future European foreign policy. In short, operational implementation is paramount. Relations with Russia are of utmost importance. We must not let the criticism of Russia's Chechnya policy expressed in the Council of Europe be overlooked. To our extreme regret, we must note that press freedom is not yet guaranteed in Russia. We invited the journalist Babitsky to visit us next Thursday, but the Russian authorities are not allowing him to leave. I hope the European Commission will lodge a vigorous protest with the Russian authorities about this. Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, when a parliament debates priorities in the legislative process, everything becomes a priority. For me, the most important priorities are employment and thus economic growth, as well as quality of life and thus environmental protection, food safety, and consumer rights. I would now like to make a few comments on the economic and social sphere. One of the Commission's high-priority initiatives is the e-Europe initiative. Yesterday, we debated the Lisbon Summit on the economic and social renewal of Europe. I emphatically called for common growth targets so that we can achieve full employment. Full employment does not mean the complete end of all forms of unemployment; there will always be cyclical unemployment, workers looking to change jobs, and young people looking for their first job. However, full employment will be achieved when there are no longer any long-term unemployed, when every young person is offered at least one training opportunity six months after entering the labor market. This is possible if we invest more in what Mr. Guterres yesterday called ""human capital,"" that is, in basic education and, above all, in lifelong learning. In this context, the e-Europe initiative comes at just the right time. In the future, jobs will increasingly have an IT component. But we, as in the United States, lack specialists in this field. Therefore, the US Senate has approved the issuance of a total of 500,000 visas for highly qualified foreign workers over a four-year period. We must train our own specialists and ensure that they stay in Europe. A Commission document found that half of the young graduates who complete postgraduate studies in the United States end up staying there. To retain our specialists here, to attract the best specialists, and to train more, we must invest massively in research and development. The only two countries that invest a larger share of their GDP in research and development than the US, Finland and Sweden, are also the only two European countries that can compete with the Americans in communications technologies. That would be an example for other European countries to follow!"	de
How can we explain to workers who are victims of the rationalizations of global Monopoly that they must be prepared to change jobs several times in their working lives, when the great business leaders, having lost the windfall of a takeover, leave with a €30 million severance package? For years, we have been told that it is necessary to liberalize the economy. In liberalized sectors, we are witnessing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions that inevitably leads to monopolistic situations. All these stock market battles are built on nothing more than anticipated profit growth of 15%, 20%, 25%—in other words, levels that are unrealistic in their longevity. The uncontrolled increase in financial and real estate assets means that risks are also on the rise. The main risk facing us in the medium term is not inflation, but deflation caused by a collapse of speculative bubbles in the international financial markets. I conclude, Madam President, by saying that the next five years will be crucial. New rules for globalization are needed; investments in the real economy, in humanity, are needed; the visible hand of the States, the visible hand of the Commission, must guarantee the social dimension of the market economy. Madam President, Mr. President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the strategic program presents, in my view, two obvious weaknesses. It is pointless to draft a new economic and social program without having exhausted the old one. Specifically, I am referring to transport policy or regional policy. In both areas, you have excellent Commissioners in the persons of Mrs. Palacio and Mr. Barnier, yet you still give them too little importance in your strategic document. Why do I say this? In the case of transport policy, it is crucial that it be defined at the level of the European Union with a rational approach from an economic and environmental policy perspective, and this must be done before the accession of new states. If the President of the Commission would listen to me, I would be very grateful, but I can see that I will have to resign myself. I will give you three examples. First, we need reasonable liberalization of the railway sector, since we want to shift freight transport from road to rail. This makes sense from an economic and environmental policy perspective. Without liberalization, it will not be possible to make progress in developing a reasonable transport policy. The same can be said in relation to the area of air safety in Europe. Citizens cannot understand why we liberalize air transport, but instead keep airspace divided into 15 different sectors, controlled at the national level, with the resulting economic disadvantages for airlines and environmental pollution. In this regard, you still have work to do. Commissioner, regional policy is too little mentioned in your document. The social and economic cohesion of the EU is a crucial task for the Community. If we fail to fulfill it, citizens in disadvantaged regions will fear enlargement. We must make it clear to them that over the next five years we will promote their outreach to the wealthier regions, allocating reasonable resources to support disadvantaged regions.	es
There remains the fixed point. The fixed point is the means. Well, you are standing here before a Parliament some of whose members still remember what I would call the White Paper syndrome—that is, that magnificent initiative by Jacques Delors that was thwarted by the accountants of the Ecofin Council. We don't want the same misfortune to befall you today, because the project you are proposing is so promising that it can provide impetus and offer Europe the future perspective demanded by our colleague Goebbels. However, you need the necessary means to do this, which I fear you are somewhat lacking today. Your task, therefore, is to raise the necessary resources, which, however, will not be possible within the narrow framework of Agenda 2000. Your colleagues will therefore have to be persuaded to provide funding for the proposals you will put forward. One example among many—and this is one of the important measures you have proposed—concerns the information and knowledge society. Without a doubt—and you've explained this clearly—the social divide is a fundamental problem we must combat. This must not be compounded by what I would call the digital divide. Who do you intend to offer this information and knowledge society to? An increasingly older or aging population, a population that remains poor despite everything, and, unfortunately, a population that is increasingly less well-educated? Therefore, we must start at the grassroots level if this knowledge society is not to be limited to the profit-seeking of a few successful start-ups, which are certainly necessary. But that is probably not your goal. Unfortunately, one area is missing from your program: public services. Public services have played a fundamental role in the history of our European social model. While we no longer live in the era of monopolies, the Commission has initiated a process of liberalizing several public sectors, opening them up to competition in order to modernize and make them more efficient. However, we cannot stop there. What is now needed is a more precise definition of the future, in this context of competition and the information society, of the most important public service tasks to be performed by both public and private companies in this sector. In this regard, more sustainable measures are needed, which are not yet included in the Commission's work programme, but which you could initiate. I believe this would send an extremely important signal. This knowledge-based society is ultimately based on research and development, and I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Commission's initiative to create a European Research Area. However, the Commission and Parliament need the Council to provide this European Research Area with the necessary resources. The Framework Programme is not sufficient; it must be further resourced and its main objectives modified. This is certainly a major task, but we are counting on you. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President-in-Office of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have spoken of a political deficit.	de
"The restructuring of companies is part of the principle of free determination of investments, and must therefore be defended. However, events that are clearly in contrast with these principles are increasingly occurring. Among these today is a case that, at first glance, may seem sectoral and insignificant in scope but which, if allowed to pass without any authoritative intervention by the European Union, will become an unwritten rule that will cause difficulties for many Member States and the Union as a whole. An American company - Goodyear - with production sites in Italy, Germany, England, is, from its point of view legitimately, reviewing its production and relocation. It is doing so, however, perhaps, not respecting the Community rules on the matter: certainly, not giving reasonable notice and not taking care of the obligation to account for the use of public funding, both Italian and European. In Italy, Commissioner Liikanen, Goodyear is not proceeding with restructuring, but with closing a plant that, with its production, covers 14 percent of the market and that Goodyear itself has defined as ""with the highest qualification of its workers"", a plant that was opened by investing European money for a total of 85 million euros. Closure without warning, therefore, and without any desire to discuss the fate of the plant and its workers, despite the fact that with the public funds used in that plant there is little that is private and much that is public. It would be serious if every non-European company learned, in fact, to use Europe like a bus, where you don't pay for the ticket, you don't pay for the collaboration, you cash in for having used the vehicle and you leave without having to answer to anyone. Europe must guarantee freedom in all its forms, including that of using one's own money for one's own purposes of freedom, not to have it used by others at will, others who claim to cash in and refuse to discuss, at the time of divorce, even on the terms of divorce, while keeping in mind that this is a unilaterally declared divorce. Commissioner Liikanen spoke earlier of restructuring that must not be done in an ignorant manner. In this case, unfortunately, those who undergo it are unaware and those who implement it appear to be unaware. I would like to point out to Commissioner Liikanen that it is not easy to go to national courts. Of course, it is always possible to do so, but when jobs have been lost, when industries have been closed, going to court, with a slow justice system like the Italian one, leads to a result that is certainly not comforting. Commissioner Liikanen, we expect an authoritative intervention. Of course, as a Parliament, we expect to be able to collaborate on the resolution you mentioned - we are very ready - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this issue, which certainly cannot be concluded and passed as it has almost passed. Mr President, honourable colleagues, for the second time in four months we are discussing the restructuring of companies in Europe. Today, as then, the starting point for the debate is offered by the reorganisation of large companies, combined with the loss of jobs."	it
"To this end, important Community initiatives—which our committee has always supported—are emerging from Bergen, aimed at rebuilding the biomass of spawning stocks, reducing and adapting fishing efforts to resources, protecting juveniles, species, and their habitats, and adopting technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fishing. These aspects are key to the future of fisheries, along with effective control systems. But we must not allow ourselves to be carried away by maximalism in this area, as Mr. Katiforis initially suggested in his draft report. I am referring to this now because I will not have time to speak later. I would like to point out in this regard that the numerous amendments tabled and adopted in our committee and the flexibility shown by Mr. Katiforis enabled the adoption of his report in our committee. As fate would have it, my report and Mr. Katiforis's report on fisheries and the environment coincide in this very plenary session, and at the same time, our committee's oral question—which we will examine tomorrow—on the extremely serious consequences for fisheries of the oil tanker accident, the Erika. Maritime transport and industrial and urban pollution, as well as waste, have a negative impact on fisheries. Their problems do not stem solely from overfishing. Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:00. Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0017/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament ""Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment"" (COM(1999)363 - C5-0176/1999 - 1999/2155(COS)). . (EN) This House has in the past debated the problems of resource management and environmental protection in the fisheries sector. This particular communication from the Commission is part of the Commission's overall strategy to improve the integration of environmental considerations into other Community policies. The Commission's overall strategy is to direct fishing activities toward economically and environmentally sustainable levels through the management of scarce resources, thereby preventing depletion caused by overexploitation and/or environmental degradation. The alternative for successful management lies in downsizing the fishing industry as resources dwindle and the demand for fishery products is increasingly met by imports. I am aware that a Spanish newspaper has described me as an enemy of the fishing industry because I have said such things. Of course, I am only an enemy of the fishing industry to the extent that someone would be an enemy of the fishing industry who recommends not cutting down the branch on which they are sitting. This is an inadvisable policy. In particular, the communication calls for controlling fishing pressure to benefit commercial stocks and marine systems, improving nature conservation measures in the marine environment, gradual coastal zone management, better training, transparent information, and a greater contribution of scientific research to fisheries management. All these priorities will be pursued at Community level and in various international forums in which the Community participates."	es
We need joint, interregional, and transnational bodies in which all local and regional authorities, as well as all economic and social stakeholders, are actively involved. Parallel projects developed on both sides of the border must no longer be allowed to exist. We must create a cross-border culture, and this requires innovative approaches to administrative cooperation that can overcome existing borders and the difficulties arising from the different systems of responsibilities in the individual Member States, regions, and municipalities. It must not happen that a project cannot be implemented due to communication problems. During the committee discussion, we also noted that there are problems coordinating INTERREG with other funding instruments such as MEDA, TACIS, or PHARE, which run for one or two years. In its draft resolution, Parliament attaches great importance to resolving these problems; it submits proposals to the Commission for solutions and sets reasonable deadlines for implementing the necessary changes. Mr President, the reason I have spoken in this debate is that the URBAN initiative has been quite successful, particularly in Ireland. I am therefore very keen for the European Union to continue its contribution in this area. It is a sad fact that hundreds, if not thousands, of communities in the European Union have to suffer from extreme poverty and disadvantage. Even in very wealthy Member States and large cities, large numbers of people live in ghettos with inadequate housing, low levels of education, underdeveloped physical infrastructure, and rampant drug addiction and all that goes with that. I believe that the European Union must stand by the Member States to demonstrate that it can be of help in supporting European citizens and also that the Union is doing something for these citizens and their families. The programme has been hugely successful in Ireland, and I am, of course, aware of its success in other countries. In the beginning, progress was slow, and this slowness was due to the need to let the local population develop these programs themselves. It is crucial that they contribute their own initiative and their own expertise about local conditions to the development of these initiatives. It would be very easy to have these programs developed quickly and on time by external experts, but this approach would undermine the entire purpose of the URBAN program. Before I conclude, I would like to raise one more point: We should insist that wherever the funds are being channeled and wherever this program is being developed, everything is done within the framework of a serious URBAN development policy. Unfortunately, this is not the case in Ireland. I welcome the innovative approach of the EQUAL program and its goal of integrating discriminated groups into the labor market. I consider the development partnerships to be a very clever concept, even if they are experimental in nature. However, I have two important concerns about the development partnerships. They should also be made accessible to smaller groups so that they can develop, implement, and monitor the programs. We need a high degree of flexibility for this program. In the past, I have repeatedly emphasized the need to use simple language instead of technical jargon to ensure comprehensibility for everyone.	de
The Brok report is an excellent instrument in this regard; indeed, it is regrettable that, as it is a public debate, it is influenced by the political position taken by the Council and the Commission and that no more can be said about this excellent report. In any case, future developments depend not only on you, but also on us to the extent that we provide you with decisions and opportunities. Returning to the Brok report, Cyprus and Malta are the last islands in the Mediterranean and, if I am not mistaken, in the whole of Europe that have not yet joined the Union. This has a symbolic value because the Mediterranean and its islands - I am an islander myself - are the region where those who live there and those who come there in the summer from northern Europe to spend their holidays meet. From this point of view, the island of Aphrodite, as Cyprus is called, and the island of pirates, as we kindly call Malta, are two pearls that should be integrated into the Union soon. They have high incomes and excellent trade relations and, ultimately, they will be the test of the political will of the Union. In conclusion, I have no reason to go into further detail given the unanimity that reigns in the Chamber, but I would just like to make a point to the President-in-Office of the Council. I believe that his speech was not impeccable, but I hope it was a translation error and I await his reply so that I can have an answer. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully to your speeches and in particular to some rather emphatic statements on the Cyprus question, in defence of what is now the law in Cyprus and which the European Union obviously recognises, given that it recognises the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council on the matter. In this regard, Mr Wurtz, there is no ambiguous silence on the part of the Council: it takes full responsibility for the interpretation it gives to the situation existing in Cyprus. It was, moreover, this situation and this interpretation that prompted him to adopt the decision we know about in Luxembourg at the end of 1997, and to take the first steps in the process of accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union. Regardless of more or less emotional positions on this kind of question, I would like you to realise that the routine of international negotiations usually forces governments - and when I say governments I mean all governments - to give a somewhat more flexible interpretation. It is true that we need more emotional positions to project the questions we are dealing with onto the human level, but we must also realise that it is thanks to the rationality of political positions and flexibility in negotiations that we can find solutions that allow us to overcome the great controversies that have given rise to the tragedies of the past. Leaving aside the guilty - we are not here to make an inventory of the guilty, the United Nations resolutions are clear on this - I believe we should exploit, without emotion and with greater rationality, the opportunities that the new situation offers us.	it
The sixth report from the European Commission draws some very valuable conclusions. I will summarize two of them, which have already been recalled by the rapporteur, one positive, the other negative. The first is that significant progress has been made in territorial and social cohesion throughout the Union and that Community funds have played an important, although not decisive, role in reducing regional inequalities. The negative is that the considerable effort that has been made has proven more effective in bringing the GDP and productivity of European regions closer together than in bringing their employment levels closer together. It is therefore necessary to better coordinate structural financing and job creation. This, Commissioner, is the first mandate for the next period. I therefore ask, Mr President, my distinguished colleagues to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as have other colleagues, not to lose sight of the conclusions of its sixth periodic report with regard to programming for the period 2000-2006. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and also for the way in which the proposed amendments were taken into consideration during the committee's examination. The sixth periodic report provides a basis on which to assess the achievement of the objectives of the European Union's regional policy. The report shows that, despite all efforts, growth is uneven. Extremely rapid growth continues in central Europe. Similarly, the most dynamic centres continue to grow faster than the European average, while many regions in the north and south of Europe are experiencing significantly slower growth. A thorough analysis of the reasons why regional policy does not deliver the desired results in all regions is now necessary. Is the reason bureaucracy? Or have regional disparities—distance, climate that is too hot or too cold, dispersed settlements, harsh conditions—not been sufficiently taken into account? How can the European Union meet the challenges of global change in such a way that less developed regions can keep pace? It would also be important to analyze the effects of enlargement on the Structural Funds and on the development of the most remote regions. Member States also have their share of responsibility in this area and they must not forget this. Some Member States have contravened the principle of subsidiarity and reduced regional resources at national level, while regional aid provided through the European Union has been increasing. This has had a detrimental effect on the results of regional policy. In the future, we must also consider establishing indicators that will enable us to target measures at the right time and in the right place. For example, uncontrolled migration has not been sufficiently taken into account. Here too, we must stress the crucial role of SMEs as providers of employment and drivers of regional development. It is particularly important to make new technologies and know-how available to businesses in developing regions. Our group supports the adoption of this report. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Community's territorial policy has not yet been able to meaningfully reflect differences in residents' incomes.	fr
So, Madam President, I repeat that we have discussed the action programme for the next five years and that we are ready to present it whenever Parliament wants - even this week, if it so decides - while next month it will be the turn of the programme for 2000, exactly as it was agreed. Madam President, I hear some laughter among the Socialists. I have been told that a large part of the Socialist Group would also like to see this item removed from the agenda, as the vote in the Conference of Presidents did not include the vote of the working group of the competent colleagues in the Socialist Group. I do not know whether this information is correct, but we in the PPE-DE would nevertheless be grateful if this item were removed, as Parliament has already dealt with this issue on several occasions. There are also some decisions against this tax. For this reason, the PPE-DE Group requests that this item be removed from the agenda. Thank you, Mr Poettering. Mr Wurtz has the floor and speaks against the request. Madam President, I would first like to point out the lack of logic on the part of Mr Poettering, who has just lectured the Socialist Group for going back on a decision that the Conference of Presidents had approved by a clear majority. Well, he did the same thing. It was discussed and everyone agreed, except the PPE-DE Group and the ELDR Group. On that occasion - my fellow Presidents will remember - I also stressed that the point was not so much whether we were for or against the Tobin tax, but whether we had the courage to listen to what the Commission and the Council thought about it. That is not asking a lot. I therefore reiterate my proposal to keep the oral question to the Council and the Commission on the agenda, in order to learn, once and for all, the position of the two institutions on a relatively modest proposal, but one which would send an important signal to public opinion, especially in the wake of the emotion aroused by the failure of the Seattle Conference. I now put to the vote the request by the PPE-DE Group to withdraw the oral question on the wealth tax from the agenda. (Parliament rejected the request by 164 votes to 166, with 7 abstentions) Madam President, I thank Mr Poettering for the unexpected publicity he has just given to this debate. Thank you! Madam President, has my vote, which was not cast electronically because I do not have the ballot paper, been counted? My vote was in favour. In fact, if we add the votes of the two Members who spoke, the result... Madam President, the Presidency has already announced the outcome of the vote. No changes are permitted. Madam President, I will respect your decision, but during the previous vote on the question of the Commission's strategic plan, I had expressed my intention to speak on behalf of my group before the vote, but I did not have the opportunity. I would be very grateful if you would allow me to make a declaration of vote on behalf of my group before closing this item on the agenda.	it
Mr. President, I am no friend of Milosevic and his government. Nevertheless, I have serious doubts about the legitimacy of NATO's intervention against Yugoslavia in the Kosovo conflict, firstly because of the lack of a UN Security Council resolution, and secondly because I believe this intervention could have been avoided if unrealistic demands regarding Serbia's sovereignty had not been made at Rambouillet. The current situation in Kosovo, where the ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Roma has now been completed, speaks for itself. Shouldn't NATO at least admit its mistake and accept responsibility for the deliberate bombing of the Belgrade television station building and the deaths of over 20 civilian journalists, as this remains a grave moral stain on the way this war was fought and will now potentially lead to shameful accusations of war crimes against our Western leaders? Mr. Member of Parliament, As far as the European Union's positions are concerned, there is no selective assessment, interpretation, or analysis of military objectives, especially measures against a specific type of infrastructure that served as a support for Mr. Milosevic's political and propaganda system. Therefore, I cannot tell you whether we agreed or disagreed with a specific NATO action. They are part of an overall plan with which we agree. Some of these actions may be questionable, and some have even been described as regrettable by NATO itself. Others, however, can be justified on tactical grounds, namely, to prevent Mr. Milosevic from continuing his domestic propaganda campaign. In any case, on behalf of the Council, I do not wish to make a value judgment on any particular NATO action in the military field. Mr. President-in-Office of the Council, as I am well-versed in the history of the Balkans, I would like to remind you that the peoples of Yugoslavia lived together peacefully for decades. The destabilization began approximately ten years ago with the dissolution of Yugoslavia, in which the European Union played a decisive role. Yugoslavia's crime was to be the only Balkan country not to want to join NATO or the European Union. What remained after the airstrikes is now being destroyed by the supposedly disarmed KLA, under the watchful eye of KFOR, which is increasingly revealing itself as an occupying power. Every day, new crimes against non-Kosovo Albanians, as well as against Kosovo's cultural heritage and hundreds of violations of UN Resolution 1244, come to light. In my view, the best course of action would be for the Council to end the occupation of this part of Yugoslavia and seek a solution acceptable to all sides, one that respects the ethnic characteristics of the region and, above all, the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of an independent country. I respect the honourable Member's opinion and knowledge of the Balkan region, although, frankly, I find it difficult to understand how respecting the region's specific features in terms of political stability can be a solution to the problem. Indeed, considering the region's democratic stability, one could argue that the cause of the current situation can be found in the disintegration of Yugoslavia. However, we do not wish to enter into an assessment of an international development here.	de
Thus, a small European reform can conceal a medium-sized one, and a medium-sized one can conceal a large one. Not to mention that the large one can, in turn, conceal another gigantic one, because we will soon see the proposal for European criminal law and, why not, a European Minister of Justice, controlled by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament. I therefore believe that we must reflect carefully on the balance of power, which risks being upset by the presentation of this type of seemingly ad hoc reform. Finally, it seems to us that proposals such as that of the European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to imagine Europe in any other way than as a pyramidal and centralized system, organized around a super-state. The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on the contrary, wants a Europe with multiple centers around which nations unite. And the network could translate, for example, into better coordination between national judicial authorities, with the possible creation of national training bodies specializing in offenses against Community finances. The legal framework, Mr. President, already exists. Its principle is sound. It just needs to be refined. Mr. President, Mrs. Theato proposes an institutional revolution for two reasons. Public opinion, which remained indifferent to the 20 million unemployed and thousands of cases of mad cow disease, is apparently concerned about fraud that could endanger financial interests, and these two reasons would justify a dual system: a European Criminal Code that covers anti-EU crimes and a European Prosecutor General. Mrs. Theato has probably forgotten a European prison, given that the FBI, the European police force, already exists following the creation of OLAF. All of this would be instituted through two regulations, one for the Prosecutor General and one for the Criminal Code, regulations that would be based on Article 280 of the Treaty, that is, based on secondary law, since the nature of secondary law is to allow all kinds of deviations. Indeed, there is a double deviation. First, the classic Eurofederalist ideological drift: a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomacy, a single army, and now a single criminal law system and a single prosecutor. All this to fight fraud worth less than a billion euros, while allowing the loss of tens of billions of euros due to the GSP, free trade zones, customs gifts to Chiquita, and the billions lost in the fourth resource, GDP, resulting from the budget rationing pact. Then comes the Puritan drift: Northern German Europe, Lutheran, Calvinist, and Quaker Europe, wants to impose its moral order on us. Ultimately, the more morals are relaxed, the more we cling to our wallets. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, at this time, effective criminal protection of the European Union's financial interests is more essential than ever.	es
Mr. President, we will vote for the GUE/NGL Group's resolution because it denounces Total-Fina's responsibility for this ecological disaster, and I support the proposal to ban flags of convenience and the use of outdated ships, as well as to require double-hulled tankers. Let me add that, at the very least, Total should be required to fully compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil spill. How can we prevent similar disasters from occurring in the future without imposing draconian measures on the major oil companies, and indeed on others who, for the sake of additional profits, risk making our planet uninhabitable? How can we not be outraged when a bank, citing banking secrecy, refuses to reveal the names of the Erika's owners, without governments reacting? Fundamentally, the problem lies in the fact that all governments, as well as all European institutions, grant large corporations like Total-Fina and their ilk the right to maximize their profits at the expense of their workers and the environment. They grant companies and banks business secrecy, even when doing so conceals genuinely criminal activities. Under these circumstances, even the best resolutions remain mere petitions of principle, incapable of preventing large corporations from causing damage. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favor of tightening the rules on port state control and the rules on classification societies. But we must also stick to the facts. The ship Erika has been inspected four times in the last two years. The number of inspections cannot be the problem; what matters is ensuring the intensity of the inspections. I have heard in the discussions of the past few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to carry out the inspections! I cannot accept that. If the Member States decide with us that 25% of ships will be inspected on the basis of port state control, then they must also provide the personnel! Then the inspections must be carried out in such a way that the inspector doesn't just go on board and check whether a fire extinguisher is missing, but also conducts material inspections, because this ship obviously broke apart due to material fatigue. This can only be determined if the inspections are carried out with great intensity. Our aim should be to ensure that port state controls are not superficial, but that they include the material. Secondly, I also share the Commissioner's suggestions and would like to encourage her to continue down this path. If it turns out that one or more classification societies have issued biased reports, then they should be removed from the list of permitted classification societies! That is the only deterrent to prevent other classification societies from also issuing biased reports. Dear Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we have the TÜV for ships. The classification societies are the TÜV for ships! There are also good societies. You know some good societies, our French colleagues know some good societies, but we have to look closely to see which societies don't meet the requirements, and those must be removed from the list.	de
The discretionary powers of the State, which you refer to in point (e) of your Amendment 10, do not seem to me to be consistent with the entire text of your otherwise excellent report. I therefore ask colleagues to consider my amendment with an open mind and hope that we can reach a conclusion tomorrow. On the surface, these two proposals appear to introduce certain procedural changes in order to promote free movement within Europe and to implement the recent judgments referred to by Mrs Berger in her introductory remarks. However, in the case of the United Kingdom, we believe that they go beyond this and are therefore unacceptable. This applies partly to their content, but also partly to their legal basis relating to the United Kingdom's special status. Under the arrangements contained in the Treaty, the United Kingdom maintains its border controls. The system proposed in these legal texts provides that third-country nationals wishing to come to the United Kingdom in accordance with the procedures described must present the service provision card issued by another Member State, thereby circumventing United Kingdom border controls. If there are to be changes to the United Kingdom's current border control regulations, then these changes should be brought about by the United Kingdom Government and Parliament, not en passant through the European legislative process. For this reason, we will vote against these two proposals. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to sincerely thank the rapporteur and Mr Wieland for their efforts in bringing together the various amendments and the various interests so homogeneously in this report. These two proposals make a significant contribution to the implementation of one of the four core principles of the internal market, the freedom to provide services. The new regulation for cross-border services will undoubtedly improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and flexibility of companies. The strict framework for issuing the EU service provision card—and here I agree with Mr Wieland—is essential, as it serves to prevent abuses such as illegal immigration and bogus contracts. Why do I consider the directive so necessary? Three reasons: because of the economic importance of third-country national workers in the EU, because of the competitiveness of companies, and because of the smooth functioning of the internal market. Therefore, on the one hand, I welcome the strict framework, and on the other, I appeal for the appropriate controls carried out by the Member States to be as effective and simple as possible. My final question, because I am repeatedly asked about it, is directed at the Commission: Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations? How do you see Article 1 being interpreted and explained, given that this plays a particularly important role for our country, which borders many new countries and is particularly relevant in the accession negotiations? Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, until now, businesspeople have had to realize that two important freedoms, namely freedom of movement and the freedom to provide services, did not apply to them. In fact, they still had to endure endless bureaucratic immigration procedures from Member States in which a service was to be provided. Approximately 13 million third-country nationals live in Europe. The number of business people among them is not exactly known, but it is certainly not small.	de
"I cite as proof an excellent report that our colleague Mario Soares prepared in international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans. Rightly, when we talked about climate change, we referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere. But we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will considerably destabilize entire parts of our planet. It is therefore appropriate that Europe, both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, whether groundwater, surface water, or seas, must be, in a certain way, exemplary in its practices. Moreover, our Europe has signed international conventions. I am thinking in particular of the OSPAR Convention, where it has made commitments. She said: ""In a few years, we must have stopped the discharge of pollution, we must have stopped the increase in pollution, and we must even get close to a level almost zero, when it comes to toxic substances or dangerous substances."" So Europe signs international agreements, and then the directive arrives, along with concrete policies on the ground, and then it announces that it will not be able to achieve the objectives set or it postpones them to dates such that the very credibility of signing these international conventions is called into question. This is why, when initiating the debate on the Water Framework Directive, from the first reading, the European Parliament sought to demand consistency between the framework directive and international objectives, and in particular, regarding compliance with OSPAR, convergence that is effective, concrete, and that commits us to action. The European Union's water policy is not starting from scratch. Many directives have been adopted, and it is the Commission's desire to make them more readable, more compatible with each other, with clearer objectives. It is therefore a concern for rationality that led to the creation of this framework directive. But our Parliament, at first reading, insisted that the current directive not only be compatible with the commitments we have made - OSPAR type - but also allow us to reverse the course of things. Because despite these numerous directives, despite frequent declarations on the effort that must be made in terms of water protection, when we look at the state of the environment in Europe, we see that the objectives have not been achieved. In many cases the situation has deteriorated and therefore, we cannot be satisfied with an effort to rationalize the texts. We must set ourselves objectives that match the challenges that lie ahead, and we do not have much time, because if we do it, as the Commission proposed, with excessively long deadlines, when it and the Council have extended the deadlines even further, we will not only have a credibility problem with the public, but we know very well that efforts will be postponed until tomorrow, and tomorrow they will be postponed again, and so we know that we will not achieve the objectives set. I insist on this point, because we should not wait for the umpteenth time for disasters to be reported every day in our newspapers to say to ourselves: ""ah! Europe did not do it, ah! Europe should have done it,"" and then, in haste, act as if we were going to resolve the problems that we did not want to tackle head-on in good time."	fr
"We are, in principle, opposed to this type of program, as well as to structural funds, but since the vote only concerns how these resources will be used - and not their volume - we voted for the report. We believe, in fact, that it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups mentioned in the report. We did not vote against this report because it announces some fair general principles: for example, the need to combat racism in the workplace and to reduce gender inequalities in the labor market. But we did not vote for it either because all of this remains extremely vague, if not wishful thinking. On the other hand, in the chapter on aid and training projects for refugees, the report represents a step backwards compared to the original text, since it insists that it no longer concerns refugees as such, but ""only refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Convention."" This restriction is unacceptable when, throughout Europe, many refugees find themselves in a dramatic situation, without protection, forced to work illegally and in hiding, while the governments and police forces of so-called democratic states hunt them down. The first step in this area is to give these undocumented migrants the legal means to lead a decent life and to be able to work without being relegated to the status of pariahs, victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple administrative and police harassments, the main one being having to live in constant fear of deportation. I voted in favour of Mrs Stenzel's report on the EQUAL initiative because I believe it is essential to continue the work that was started with the previous NOW, Horizon, Youthstart and Integra components of the ADAPT and Employment initiatives. We must build on the lessons we have learned from these actions. EQUAL stands for ""equality"". It must produce results. I welcome the proposed focus on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and all other forms of inequality in the employment market. I also support the desire to move away from an outdated format and bring partners together to find innovative ways to stem unemployment. Flexibility is needed. I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative. In the last programming period, 9% of the structural funds were allocated to Community initiatives. This figure is now 5.3%. This means that the funds must be used to achieve maximum effect, and information about partnerships must be widely and quickly disseminated. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted several of the amendments I had tabled, concerning, for example, the emphasis on access to seed capital, how to exploit new business opportunities in towns and rural areas, and the criticism that business participation was insufficient in previous initiatives. This has often resulted in good projects not leading to real employment opportunities. The positive experience of innovative actions by small developers has been weakened by their distance from the decision-making process."	fr
"Only women can invent policies capable of changing structures created by men and for men. Because it is structural discrimination that women face most, whether in politics or in the labor market. It is therefore up to European political parties to open up to women. Furthermore, Article 191 of the Treaty (formerly Article 138 A) states that they—I quote—""constitute an important factor in integration within the Union."" The article goes on to say that ""these parties contribute to shaping European consciousness and expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union."" While this provision has no legal value, it is nonetheless highly symbolic. It grants political parties an important role in building a democratic Europe. This can be done, for example, by introducing positive discrimination measures and promoting parity within our political parties. Some of them presented joint lists for the 1999 European elections. This is a good practice that needs to be generalized. I don't know if there is a cause-effect relationship, but the fact is that the proportion of female Members of the European Parliament rose from 25.7% in 1994 to 29.9% in 1999. Furthermore, a woman has held the presidency since the 1999 elections. I will conclude by repeating the conclusions drawn from the April 1999 conference organized by the Commission, entitled ""Women and Men in Power."" Equality between men and women is not an issue that concerns only women; it is a challenge that affects our entire society! Some progress has been made recently with the increase in the number of women present in the Union's decision-making bodies. In our own institution, 30% of elected representatives are currently women, including the President of the European Parliament. Finland has also just elected a woman as President. On average, a quarter of Member State governments and just over a fifth of their parliaments are composed of women. This situation is still far from fully satisfactory, especially since the figures vary enormously between Member States, with the Nordic countries having a much higher representation of women in positions of responsibility and decision-making. This situation has more to do with attitude and respect for the quality and capacity of women's contribution to society than with fixed quotas. My group does not support quotas in general because, in the long term, they can be counterproductive and even undermine the cause for which they were created. However, we recognize that the experience in all Member States is not the same, and some recourse to this type of measure may even be justified as a temporary remedy to rebalance women's representation where they are grossly underrepresented. We support the resolution on women in decision-making, adopted in view of commemorating International Women's Day on March 8, which incorporated ten amendments from the Liberal Group and softened the reference to quotas in line with the approach outlined above."	es
"There have been large public investments at the federal level, at the state level and at the local level. They have been enormous, and they have been investments in modern infrastructure. Pay attention, here our direct commitment - I repeat, direct - at the public level and at the various levels is to build the telematic highways, that is, the roads on which these new vehicles run. The market, private individuals, businesses will build the vehicles to run, but we are the ones who have the obligation to build the new highways. So, what Minister Guterres said about the computer in every school, about the network that must reach all peripheral areas, this is not an obligation that can be left exclusively to the market because, simply, the market does not do this, and moreover without this we will not reach those new objectives of productivity development that are necessary. Our problem therefore is to avoid the crisis of peripheral economies, which does not mean centralization, does not mean centralized planning, but it means giving peripheral economies the same opportunities that we give centralized economies. This is why the program must be addressed to schools, this is why we must take an entire age group and insist on it, ensuring that in that age group there is no one left out of the new literacy. Lisbon therefore has a very specific strategy. In Lisbon the real problem, in my opinion, is to inject new courage for employment, for growth, knowing that we can do it, and therefore we must move towards this model that is based on certain balances. To summarise today's debate I would like to take an expression that was used by one of you parliamentarians, if I remember correctly the Honourable Goebbels, who said: ""We have a deficit of future in Europe"". It is simply this. We have been crying over ourselves for a long time, while the seeds of what we had planted with so much sacrifice at the roots of Europe were maturing. Now, please, let us also try to close the deficit of future and give meaning to the new generations, thinking that we are working together modestly but seriously for something that lasts. It is clear then that it becomes essential to put the three processes together. Unfortunately our terminology is horrible, but we really put together the problems of macroeconomics, work and structural problems now, and then we have the capacity and the possibility to obtain the results we wanted, with very simple actions, even specific ones. Let's remember the European society: we have not yet found unanimity for the European society, but there are hundreds of thousands of companies that ask us for it. At all costs this must be done, because simply the idea of operating in fifteen countries - which are now becoming one - with different rules in the elementary principles of business is an unsustainable idea: we cannot sell it, because it makes no sense. The same goes for the European patent: we cannot sell this either; and the rules on procurement, the capital market; even the seeds of social security coordination, because it is useless for us to think of great opportunities for mobility, to create very successful programs like ERASMUS, SOCRATES to make people more mobile, if then we have social security rules that do not help us in this mobility."	it
It is right that the Lisbon Summit, which will take place at the end of this month, should focus on analysing the situation. Despite their complexity, these processes all have one thing in common: improving the quality of life of the citizens of the European Union. To achieve this, we do not need new formulas, new working groups or new forums for discussion. We know very well what tools we have at our disposal. Often, citizens' opinions and, at times, ideological opposition mean that these tools are not used. It is now extremely important to quickly remove all the obstacles that are preventing the creation of a real European internal market; only in this way will it be possible to avoid having to continue to move in fifteen different national markets, as is still the case in many sectors. When, in the 1980s, the idea of the internal market began to be put forward, it was possible to maintain a pace similar, to use a metaphor, to that of an accelerated steam train. Today - with the rapid development of e-commerce and the speed of data transmission and processing, the situation is completely different - we would need at least the speed of Mika Häkkinen's racing car. Nevertheless, we must ensure that the power of decision-making does not run out and that the engine does not start to falter before reaching the finish line. How can we expect to create the most competitive economic area in the world if we do not have the courage to liberalise competition within it? The liberalisation of the telecommunications and energy sectors that has already been approved will help create new jobs and reduce prices for both industry and consumers. Similarly, removing obstacles for small and medium-sized enterprises - whether these are complex procedures imposed by the authorities, access to venture capital or tax issues - is essential for greater competitiveness and prosperity. Improving global competitiveness also includes adequate tax harmonisation and the modernisation of our social security systems so that at least those EU member states with particularly high tax pressures can reduce the rates that slow down the employment process. The foundations are laid through training and research. It is right to try to quickly create knowledge infrastructures that can be made available to businesses, schools and private individuals at reasonable prices or free of charge. It is particularly important to strive to create and maintain sufficient resources to foster the development of promising employment sectors. These naturally include the technology sector, e-commerce, tourism and, for example, care for the elderly, given the undeniable continued ageing of the population. Parliament, the Commission and the Council must remember two important things: regardless of whether it is training and research, developing competitiveness or removing obstacles to entrepreneurship, these are tasks that fall within the competence of the member states.	it
By establishing a sector reserved for public postal operators on the basis of weight and price limits, the Postal Directive enabled gradual and controlled liberalisation. The sudden reduction of these limits calls into question the balance between the public service obligation and the economic viability of postal services. In the face of a process of globalisation in which the pursuit of profitability and profit is increasingly at odds with the aim of regional balance and social cohesion, I would like to reiterate our commitment to public service in the European Union, whether it concerns the post office today, the railways tomorrow, or health the day after tomorrow. Mr President, like other Scottish Members of this House, representatives of Scotland, I too raise my voice to protest against anything that leads to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote areas. The postal service and the post office are an essential feature of life in rural communities throughout Europe, and not least in Scotland. It would be disastrous if measures were taken, intentionally or even inadvertently, to destroy that. I don't think anyone wants that. I don't think the Commission wants to declare war on the Scottish or Greek islands. But I think it could cause great damage purely by accident. The point is to determine the speed and methods by which the gradual liberalization of postal services should proceed. If the targets are set too low for the continued existence of the postal service monopoly, it would become uneconomical to maintain universality of service at an affordable price in remote areas. The key is to strike a balance between universality and affordability. The very clear message to the Commission today from all sides of the House is that the Commission should proceed carefully. The Commission should not, for example, make a sudden jump from 350 grams to just 50 grams, as some Members have suggested. On the contrary, it should proceed cautiously. I can imagine that anything under 150 grams would be extremely unwise under these circumstances. The solidarity and cohesion of people throughout Europe depend on the idea that one can send a letter anywhere and that this letter will be delivered everywhere for an affordable stamp fee. Stick to universality and affordability! Mr President! To guarantee a high-quality universal postal service, it must be maintained as a public service at all costs. The universal service, which comprises an offer of high-quality postal services at affordable prices, provided anywhere in the territory, forms the basis of the operation of the entire postal system and must lead to a single tariff throughout the national territory. But for this to happen, it must be maintained as a public service. This is the only way to guarantee that the network, from collection to delivery, is all-encompassing and cannot be fragmented or used only partially, and can be used as the postal operators see fit. However, as we know, the Commission has since commissioned studies on the basis of the directive on common rules for Community postal services, which it has not informed the European Parliament of, and therefore nothing is known about the consequences of its application, either in terms of services for citizens or for current European postal operators, whether in economic terms or in terms of employment.	de
"This explains the importance of the proposals we are presenting to this end. The Commission's communication lists a series of objectives and proposals that take into account the need to continue the efforts made in the areas of control and surveillance, to adopt new technical measures in the area of selective fishing methods, to monitor the implementation of current legislation, etc. However, in its communication, the Commission also mentions that it lacks the power to enforce this legislation. However, existing measures and appropriate means are not lacking: the Commission has at its disposal a whole arsenal of mandatory provisions, measures, and decisions (of international and Community origin) already in force in the sectors of fisheries and marine environmental protection. Efficiency and hyperregulation do not go hand in hand. Maritime professionals, it must be remembered, are willing to apply Community legislation provided that it is applied equitably in all Member States, that it is technically acceptable and applicable, and that it has a real scientific basis. I find it unacceptable that, in the Committee on Fisheries, one of the European Commission officials dared to publicly state that the financial resources provided by the Commission to certain scientific bodies allow their conclusions to be controlled. This is a very serious deviation: the Commission, obviously, should not arrogate to itself any right to steer the conclusions of scientists in order to implement whatever policy it deems appropriate, taking into account only its own interests. Regarding reducing the pressure exerted by fishing activity on resources, it is important to emphasize the international nature of this obligation. What would be the point of reducing our European fishing fleet if, at the same time, third countries maintained their pressure on fishing resources? Furthermore, it must be noted that the progressive globalization of trade has considerably reduced the effectiveness of controls and monitoring of fishing activities. Transshipment has become a very common practice, and it is not uncommon for fishery products from a Member State that cannot be sold in the Union due to exceeding TACs to be marketed as imported products or as originating from another Member State. The latter case is very common in companies whose capital originates in a Member State other than the flag of the fishing vessel (this is, in fact, a covert form of ""quota-hoping""). Food safety related to seafood also plays a key role. It is necessary to preserve the positive image of these products and prevent unsafe food products from being marketed in the European Union. Therefore, the Members of the Europe of the Nations Group will vote against this report, which fails to identify the shortcomings of the Commission's communication and which increases the Natura 2000 obligations for the fisheries sector. The vote is closed. Adjournment of the session. The session is adjourned. Resumed"	es
The primary objective of this reflection is to identify the instruments available to the international community to stabilize the international monetary and financial system. From this perspective, Mr. Bolkestein, the proposed resolution does not isolate the issue of the Tobin tax. If you read it carefully, this proposed tax on capital flows is one instrument among others to try to force international investors to behave responsibly in the financial markets. Secondly, the resolution does not say that we want an initiative based solely on a European basis. This is why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund so that the European Union—that is, the Commission, but also the Council—can take a position on how to defend the opportunity to stabilize the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation. I would not like there to be any confusion in this debate. We, as environmentalists, do not want a resolution that is merely an alibi. The point is not to add another study to the dozens already conducted—the Commission's would certainly be interesting—but to obtain from the Commission and the Council, that is, from each of the governments that make up the Union, a clear political stance, positive or negative, to determine whether they are willing to defend in the relevant public forums, primarily the International Monetary Fund, the appropriateness of such a tax on the other instruments necessary for the stability of the international monetary system. As for the argument that this initiative will increase uncertainty, as far as I know, very short-term capital movements serve precisely the purpose of playing with uncertainty and betting on the evolutions between currencies or between different short-term financial assets. This argument, therefore, does not seem relevant to me. I will not go further into the underlying debate. I think everyone has their own arguments. I draw your attention, however, not only to paragraph 9 of the resolution but also to paragraph 10. This is clearly a political position, and we hope, within a very clear timeframe, the preparations for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund, and we ask, if this resolution is voted on tomorrow in plenary, that the Commission and the Council appear before Parliament to tell us what positions they would defend on this occasion. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my group is extremely pleased that such a debate is taking place today, even more so since we have spared no effort with colleagues from different groups to achieve it. Naturally, we do not all have the same approach, and I believe that our debate and the motions for resolutions we submitted at the beginning demonstrate this. That said, we are not, as far as we are concerned, indifferent to the step forward represented by the compromise resolution, which invites the Commission to submit a report within six months. We believe that the European Parliament can thus play its part by taking the initiative, albeit timidly, on this issue, although of course—and I agree with the previous speaker—if paragraph 9 were to be challenged, this resolution would clearly lose its essence. Our debate does indeed touch on a vital question that more and more citizens are legitimately asking: What place should be given to humankind and the financial sphere in today's economy?	es
Generally speaking, we can say that the first is left-wing and shows social concerns, as well as examining economic problems, while this document, which Mr Katiforis did not see fit to support - and I think he did well - is a hybrid report in which, starting from a structure with social concerns, the main conclusions have been drawn. What was Mr Katiforis proposing and which was removed from the report? He proposed an ambitious report, in an optimistic Europe, which sought to quantify the objectives for the results that were to be achieved. In fact, Europe has advanced thanks to programmes with quantified objectives. For example, why was the proposal withdrawn that the working population in Europe should reach 75% of the population, when it is currently 60%? A rate of 60% is very low compared to that of Japan or the United States and with such a modest employment rate we certainly cannot produce as much as those countries. We must therefore increase the employment rate with competitive jobs. As argued in the run-up to the Lisbon Summit, we need to prepare a scientifically trained workforce to handle new technologies; and investment needs to grow at a faster rate. We are very familiar with the idea put forward by my colleague, Mr von Wogau, that what is needed is a flexible workforce. I wanted to counter this argument with the Portuguese example, where labour laws are not flexible and where the unemployment rate is less than 5% - and has continued to fall in recent years - because investment is increasing (with Community aid, of course) at a much higher rate than the European Union average. We therefore want a Europe with economic growth, but one that is attentive to social issues. Mr President, like many other Members, I would like to thank Mr Katiforis for his interesting report. Reading the text and looking at the panorama of the European economy that emerges from it, I get a very worrying impression. The investment rate is too low, unemployment remains at excessively high levels and growth remains insufficient. That is why it is probably not surprising that the euro continues to lose ground against other currencies, despite rumours that the ECB is secretly buying euros to support their value. The rapporteur notes that stability is not an end in itself; I agree. There is too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination, and too little about the factors that can induce innovation and development. In my eyes, cooperation within the EMU is like a clumsy colossus struggling to keep pace with such a mobile economy. However, my conclusions are completely different from those of the previous speaker. I believe that we need to focus on human resources, partly through a macro-policy that generates demand and new job opportunities, partly - but perhaps above all - through measures on the ground, in terms of training, democratisation of businesses and improved social conditions.	it
If we continue to get bogged down in proposals that have so far produced mediocre results, I do not see how we will move forward, nor what the Commission will be able to do. The same applies to enlargement, which represents its own end without a much more effective reform of the European Union and its structures, and to the proposals that the Commission could also have made during the IGC. Mr President, I would like to end on a positive note, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some colleagues, regarding the telegram you sent to the Austrian government. Your position has convinced us; you were right not to isolate that country even further. However, we will see in practice what concrete actions this will lead to. I repeat, Mr President, this is a somewhat short-sighted vision in our opinion. What it lacks, above all, is a boost in the sectors I mentioned, for example the Balkans. Can we continue to exclude the Balkans from enlargement, without considering that Croatia, Macedonia and other countries also have the right to be part of our Europe? Madam President, Mr Prodi, I applaud your proposal to radically decentralise the Union's activities, but I ask you: why are you then presenting a centralising body of laws? I remember the speech your predecessor gave five years ago. Mr Santer made the same promises as you – 'less and better' – but what we ultimately got was 'much more and much worse'. I do not think you are capable of keeping your promises. You talk about decentralisation, but you act like a centraliser. This body of laws is nothing more than a monotonous list of issues over which citizens will lose all influence; it is you yourself, Mr Prodi, who is taking this influence away from citizens, even on social issues. You talk about increasing transparency, but you are presenting proposals aimed at concealing documents that are currently accessible. Your Commission is made up of 20 people who are the only ones in the EU who can propose reducing the volume of legislation. No local politician has this power once a law has been adopted in Brussels. That is why the collection of laws published by the Commission should at least be accompanied by an equally voluminous collection of competences that are referred to the Member States and the democratic power of citizens, otherwise the volume of legislation adopted in Brussels will continue to grow. We have adopted 10,000 laws and as many legislative amendments; the candidate countries have received 26,000 documents, which, for the Polish parliament, for example, represents 140,000 pages to examine. Already today, this figure is far, far too high. Brussels must make fewer decisions and give more powers in this area to citizens, regions and Member States; only decisions on cross-border issues on which national parliaments can no longer legislate effectively should be the responsibility of Brussels.	fr
Secondly, it would be necessary for the doctrine of human rights to cease being instrumentalized as it is today, an ideological war machine in the hands of a caste that arrogates to itself the right to unilaterally decree who represents human rights and who stands outside its sphere, which allows it to deny all legitimacy and, if necessary, all freedom to those whom the single thought has designated as politically incorrect. There is no freedom for the enemies of freedom, said two centuries ago the promoters of revolutionary terror, of that revolution that was, unfortunately, the matrix of all modern totalitarianisms. There are no human rights for the enemies of human rights, say today the incense-bearers of the new world order, who reign almost exclusively in financial circles, in international institutions, in the media and cultural networks, in educational institutions—and I am being modest. What remains, for example, of the human right of the Austrian to freely choose his destiny if that choice is dictated to him by those who decide in his place what is appropriate or inappropriate to do, and if his leaders, who come from a legal and legitimate process, are received in an insulting manner, as they were recently received in your country, Mr. President-in-Office of the Council, Mr. Minister of Portugal? I don't know if you are here to hear me. What will remain of the human rights of those who sympathize with the Flemish Bloc, one of the most important in the Flemish region, if the Belgian Parliament tomorrow adopts the incredible, indecent, ignominious bill emanating from its main political competitor, the Popular Union, which plainly seeks the dissolution of its rival? What remains of the right to critical study of our history when authors and editors are being persecuted, as the young historian Jean Plantin was yesterday before the Court of Appeal in my city of Lyon, the target of absurd, arrogant, and insulting demands from the Supreme Court prosecutor Jean-Olivier Viout, a self-satisfied expression of single-mindedness and intellectual conformism? What a strange conception of human rights that fraudulently equates peaceful patriotism with bellicose nationalism, legitimate protest against immigration policy with I don't know what kind of xenophobia, and the necessary defense of identities with racism! What are the human rights of the millions of French voters of the National Front, deprived of any political representation, vilified daily, as was the case on Monday, on state television channels they must pay for with their taxes, when the mere legitimately exasperated expression of one of our colleagues, Mr. Le Pen, serves as a pretext for inhuman condemnations, violating the law, violating justice, equity, and morality? And today, contrary to the clearest texts, they seek to deprive this representative of our millions of fellow citizens of the mandate he owes to their votes and not to the favors of those in power. In short, Ladies and Gentlemen, I will believe your speech on human rights in Europe when you recognize for your political adversaries the same rights you grant yourselves.	es
"I do not expect a rubber-stamping or nodding-off of everything you will be confronted with in the coming years. Rather, I am counting on the European Parliament not only to be a critical observer, as it was in this case, but also to play an active role in ensuring that the Union makes progress in the fight against crime. Votes: Mr Goebbels, excuse me, I have the impression that you are getting ahead of yourself, as there was an oral amendment to Amendment 37 proposing to rephrase the words ""with a high credit rating based on a recognized credit rating scale,"" and you had requested such an amendment. Madam President, I beg your pardon; I was first thinking of Amendment 36, which logically comes before Amendment 37. But we are now discussing Amendment 37, and here we have a similar problem. A high credit rating is required not for the bodies, but for the instruments. The text therefore reads: ""instruments with a high rating base on a recognized rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation."" Once again, I apologize for this error. Are there any objections to this oral amendment? (Parliament agrees with the oral amendment.) (By successive votes, Parliament adopts the two draft legislative resolutions.) Madam President, I asked for the floor just before the opening of the sitting to say something solely out of respect for you, as President of this Chamber, a Chamber of all those present here. For the second time in two weeks, visits to this Chamber intended to denounce conditions—which I respect and fully agree with, as I support freedom of expression for all—have led to attacks against individuals, parties like the one I represent, and institutions. I consider such behavior, especially in your presence, Madam President, to be dishonest, and I reject it emphatically, all the more so as we are approaching an election campaign. Therefore, above all, out of the respect you deserve, I cannot accept such practices and I categorically reject them. That was a personal remark, I am told. We will note this in the Minutes. Madam President, above all out of respect for you, a respect I consider you worthy of, and out of respect for this Chamber, I did not want to explicitly address the specific issue I was discussing, but I do so now, as a Member of this Parliament, as Secretary General of a political party from the Basque Country, and as an ordinary citizen of this country, because of the particularly serious accusations against individuals and parties such as mine, with a long democratic tradition and a conscientious respect for and defense of human rights for very many years. Madam President, I would like to express my concern that this sincere defense of human rights just put forward by Mr. Gorka Knörr does not seem to prevent his government from counting on the parliamentary cooperation of a political group that not only does not condemn violence against citizens and property, but supports and encourages it. I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso is requesting the floor on the same subject. We will not open a debate now."	de
"In its report to the summit, the Commission set quantitative targets for development in the areas of employment, unemployment, and female employment. In its report, the Commission also set a target for reducing poverty problems within Europe over the next ten years. I think it's a good thing that common objectives are emphasized, because countries' policies in this area will differ—they must. In some EU countries—by not mentioning any, I'm not forgetting any—we are struggling with high youth unemployment. In other countries, such as my own country, Denmark, youth unemployment is very low. Yes, there is even a struggle between employers and educational institutions to attract young people. There are differences between countries in terms of problems, systems, cultures, and traditions, and therefore there must be differences in the choice of means to achieve the common goals of greater employment and less social isolation. The design of employment policy ensures this through the exchange of experiences and ideas from the Luxembourg process. Although there are many common features in the problems we will face in the coming years, both with regard to employment policy and social policy, I must say that there are some common challenges and others that each of us must resolve separately. It is of the utmost importance that countries not only avoid hindering each other in solving social problems, but rather collaborate and inspire each other. I would like to emphasize both the importance of pursuing common objectives and also of each country maintaining its sovereignty and responsibilities in setting its social and employment policies. We must also maintain a certain level of competition between systems to ensure dynamism and development in the design of social and employment policies. Mr. President, as a representative of Flanders and on behalf of what I would call the nationalist regions represented in the European Free Alliance, I was struck by your advocacy of a strong pro-European approach in which each of the fifteen Member States does not try to gain power, but rather in which cooperation becomes stronger. You pointed out the existence of fifteen distinct public opinions, but in practice there are many more, since there are major internal differences within the Member States themselves. Is it necessary for me, as a Belgian, to point out the difference in opinion between Flanders and Wallonia? Is it necessary for me to point out that there is a difference between the former East Germany and West Germany? Furthermore, there is a danger of a dualism emerging in our public opinion due to globalization. Instead of the former differences between the ""have-nots"" and the ""haves,"" today we have differences between those who can keep pace with this society and those who cannot or who simply abandon it."	es
I would therefore like to reiterate my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the work accomplished, thank all the speakers and, of course, commend the action of Vice-President Provan during the conciliation procedure, which effectively contributed to achieving a positive result. I also welcome the Council's reasonable and flexible action. SAVE The next item is the report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint draft decision, approved by the Conciliation Committee, of the European Parliament and the Council adopting a multiannual programme to promote energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD)). Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for this useful and thorough conciliation procedure, which took place entirely in a good atmosphere, which is not always the case. I am pleased to say that I can consider the final outcome of this conciliation to be satisfactory for Parliament, since the joint text has incorporated all its amendments, both in full and after redrafting. The sum finally allocated to the programme also represents a considerable improvement on the Council's proposal at second reading, a proposal that we considered totally unacceptable, and we have made significant progress in this regard. I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals relating to SAVE and the conclusions reached at the conciliation at third reading. I would like to remind the House that Parliament adopted, at second reading, this report, which contains eight amendments, including a reinstatement of the Commission's original budget. The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments, including the budget allocation, and I thank the Commission for its continued support for the budget during the conciliation procedure, given that the Council's proposal was unacceptable. During the procedure, agreement was reached on the studies and actions to be carried out to design, implement, supplement, and evaluate Community measures. Compromise wording was agreed on five other amendments, including legislative and non-legislative measures, the inclusion of local energy centres and, very importantly, energy audit schemes in the review of progress on energy efficiency. I hope you will all agree that this is important progress. Parliament firmly defended the issue of the financial envelope in the face of the Council's very meager opening offer. In the end, we had to meet several times before the Council increased the sum and made a substantial offer. We achieved an increase of €2 million over the amount originally proposed, which was a decisive increase that I recommend to you and which, as the Commission has confirmed, will enable the implementation of the programme. This was important for us. I would like to point out, however, that this budget is and has always been modest and that, consequently, the financing of this programme is more symbolic than real. It is mainly the Member States that finance energy savings. We must bear this in mind when we approve this program. It would be unfortunate if our community achievements were more symbolism than reality, because there is enthusiasm at the local level for actions, including community actions, to promote energy conservation.	fr
I am satisfied with the rapporteur's approach to state aid and I congratulate him on it. There is indeed too often a tendency to castigate state aid as measures that distort competition. It is true that an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper functioning of the internal market and economic and monetary union. However, as the rapporteur points out, such aid is sometimes essential and can, beyond the survival of a particular company, contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158). It is clear, however, that it must be monitored, a task that falls to the European Commission. The aid allocated each year by the Member States of the Union to the sectors in question reached a total of €95 billion during the period 1995-1997, 40% of which went to the manufacturing sector. This aid has decreased considerably compared to the previous period, 1993-1995 (a drop of 13% in the total amount and from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector). This decline in aid is mainly explained by the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder. I regret, like the rapporteur, that the figures presented in the report do not cover all state aid. The European Commission must address these shortcomings as quickly as possible. It must also cooperate with the Member States to improve the quality of the data in a timely manner, that is, for the ninth report. It would be a good idea for the Commission to publish a register showing the amount of state aid per Member State. I also regret that the European Parliament is completely excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid. To compensate for this situation, the European Commission must produce, and produce, regular reports to us. I will conclude with one aspect of the use of State aid that seems particularly dangerous to me: aid that leads to the relocation of companies from one Member State to another, with the risk of a hunt for subsidies that does nothing to achieve the EU's common objectives. That is why I hope that the next report on State aid will include an assessment of the effect of such aid on employment, as well as on the industrial and craft sectors in the beneficiary countries. Langen report (A5-0073/1999) In the important debate on competition, I spoke this morning about Mr Langen's text on the application in 1998 of the 6th Steel Aid Code. As the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996, the steel sector is particularly sensitive to competitive disruption. This is why it was legitimate to introduce a system of aid for this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful companies, even though Article 4(c) of the ECSC Treaty prohibits any State aid to the steel industry. This is, in fact, the purpose of the 6th Code on Aid to the Steel Industry.	fr
I do not want to make any changes to the text of the common position. The manufacturer is responsible, must be responsible, and the final user must be able to hand in the car free of charge. In my opinion, there are many unjustified fears. The automotive industry lobby has often created confusion. I would like to reiterate to you once again that, as experience shows, the costs of treatment must be passed on. They are not that high. In my country, they are estimated at around 150 guilders per car. This starts from day one, and at the same time, the treatment of old cars can be carried out. Likewise, a large industry can be created right now to ensure that car scrapyards, which were once common in our Member States, no longer exist. Therefore, I do not want to make any changes to the compromise reached in this regard. I think it is positive that we are passing the legislation presented to us as soon as possible. This is good because the nine million cars produced each year in Europe can then also be properly recycled, and this will benefit everyone. Mr. President, the current proposal is important in our commitment to preventing the production of hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicles and is important in promoting the recycling and recovery of materials from scrapped vehicles. Therefore, I believe it is essential from an environmental perspective that the ban on the use of toxic heavy metals be fully implemented and that we do not weaken the responsibility of manufacturers. By doing so, we eliminate the incentives for manufacturers to build and manufacture cars that produce less waste. The common position, achieved with great effort in the Council, which the Commission endorsed and which was also ratified by Parliament's Environment Committee, fully meets environmental requirements. Therefore, I find the amendments tabled by members of the Environment Committee, which aim to weaken environmental requirements and, fundamentally, moderate the responsibility of car manufacturers, very strange and incomprehensible. If these amendments are adopted, I truly believe we will have thrown Parliament's credibility on environmental issues out the window. Until now, this Parliament has acted positively as a catalyst in environmental protection, and if the amendments tabled by Mr. Florenz and Mr. Lange are adopted, we will now be a negative environmental factor in this case. Added to this is the fact that if we soften manufacturers' liability in this case, this will have serious repercussions in other areas in the future, such as the upcoming directive on electronic and computer waste. Therefore, I would like to recommend to the Members of this Parliament, regardless of their political affiliation, that they vote against the amendments tabled to the common position, which will weaken the environmental standard and soften manufacturers' liability.	es
As Members of Parliament, we must emphasize with particular emphasis that the work begun to consolidate fundamental rights is becoming even more important. It is increasingly important that respect for and integrity of human dignity and minority rights, including the rights of all persons residing within the European Union, become an essential part of the principles of the rule of law in the European Union, and therefore we must ensure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights becomes legally binding. This Charter must not remain a mere declaration. It is also important that Austrian democratic forces be supported, as we have no intention on our part to isolate Austria. We know that the majority of Austrians respect these values. Austrians have also organized demonstrations; not all of them have taken place outside Austria. Certainly, many citizens who actively abstain from elections by voting for nonexistent candidates and who have long desired a change in Austrian politics have also been mobilized. In my opinion, Parliament must support these democratic forces. I also call on the President of Austria to examine all possibilities of forming a government composed of democratic forces. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply want to underline the value of a position such as the one just recalled by the Chairman of our Group, Mr. Francis Wurtz. I value the statements of the Council Presidency and the position of the 14 states that have rejected official contacts with the Austrian government in the event that Jörg Haider's party were included. Our comment is even more important because, as you know, we substantially disagree with the policies pursued by this Europe: its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit, the involvement of these same states in the dramatic war in the Balkans. This disagreement underscores even more, if possible, today's assessment: an exceptional element, because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational and neo-Nazi component in Europe is exceptional. This danger does not affect Austria, it affects Europe. We are talking about us, not Austria. We are aware of the social causes that, along with unemployment and uncertainty, contribute to fostering trends in this direction. We are aware of the cultural causes—xenophobic, racist—but we cannot fail to recognize in the inability and unwillingness of these far-right forces to settle accounts with Nazism the possibility of creating an explosive mixture in Europe. It speaks of the Alpine arc, it speaks of all our states: conditions are being created under which a danger to European democracy and civilization could be reborn. The Presidency's position has shown awareness of this civilizational tragedy. Europe shows that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe finds a soul. Now, however, it should be consistent with its actions, and the first to be consistent should be the Commission, which, on the contrary, has demonstrated on this issue a lack of transparency and a weakness that make the value of the Presidency's position even more evident.	es
However, the item was withdrawn from the Budget Committee's agenda last night without any debate or vote. Therefore, it should be removed from today's agenda. That makes sense, Mr. Wynn. The report is therefore withdrawn. Mr. Chairman, I presume that the comments Ms. Lynne made yesterday about health and safety in this building related to the pipes because there is a foul odor on the fifth floor of the tower block. This issue needs to be addressed because it clearly indicates a serious failing. I do not want to keep harping on the problems in this building, but this is a serious matter of concern. Ms. Ahern, we have noted this. I would ask you to refer this specific case, which concerns the fans on a particular floor, to the Quaestors, who are in fact responsible for these types of problems. However, we will also raise it with our departments. Thank you very much. (The minutes are adopted) Reform of European competition policy The next item is the joint debate on the following reports: A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (COM(1999) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)); A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the 28th report from the Commission on competition policy (1998) (SEC(1999)743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)); A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh report on State aid in the manufactured goods sector and certain other sectors of the European Union (COM(1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)); A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission report on the application in 1998 of its Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code) (COM(1999)094 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)). Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are holding an important debate on the European Union's competition policy. We are debating a highly controversial plan to modernise European antitrust law, namely the von Wogau report, a subject that is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic Affairs appears to indicate. I would like to say at the outset that, for my part, and in this specific case, I believe the Commission's proposal to be flawed and that it remains to be determined whether the concept of modernisation is truly justified with regard to the content of the White Paper on Articles 81 and 82 or whether, in this case, a step backwards would not be the appropriate concept. However, today we are also discussing the report on State aid and the general report on competition policy for 1998, and my contribution to this joint discussion concerns the latter report.	fr
"The legal obligation to achieve zero emissions and to cease discharges within 20 years would in fact mean a ban on the use of all the substances identified. These provisions risk creating enormous problems for transboundary basins and candidate countries and, consequently, complicating enlargement. I would like to mention one sector in particular which I follow very closely, agriculture, the main consumer of water: it must, as it has already begun to do, assume its share on the basis of the polluter-pays principle, but account must also be taken of specific features and constraints, particularly in arid regions. As regards the amendments on radioactive substances, I am in favour of controls, but the question arises as to the legal basis which falls within the scope of the EURATOM Treaty. Andersson report (A5-0033/2000) The EDD Group was unable to vote in favour of the Andersson report. It certainly contains valid points; among other things, it is admitted, on page 15, in the explanatory statement that ""the different levels of development and the different traditions of the Member States in the field of social protection make uniform harmonisation impossible"". The concept of ""uniform harmonisation"" is one of those hastily put together expressions which obscure the process of integration which is being discussed. It is also true, as stated in the explanatory statement, that harmonisation would be harmful, since ""it would impose greater efforts on the weaker Member States and, like competition, would push the more socially developed States to proceed with cuts in social protection systems. Such harmonisation would benefit no one"". And yet, that is how things are: a social model is created, which in reality involves harmonisation, and uniform harmonisation at that. In point D. it is stressed that ""the union can bring added value by defining truly binding and effective convergence criteria"", and further on in the report it is pointed out that the development of this convergence process is promoted through discussions between the ECOFIN Council and the Council of Ministers for Social Affairs and Employment, and finally in point 7 it is stressed that ""the process aimed at creating social convergence must be accompanied by effective and ambitious fiscal convergence"". And here we come to the heart of the matter: this social harmonisation project does not concern social policy, but is a continuation of the European Union's EMU project which is of very particular interest to the three countries that are outside it, and which can be saved from this Titanic, namely Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark, which is why it is important for us to underline that we cannot support a proposal whose fundamental basis is to expand the EMU project. Mr President, I voted in favour of the Commission's measure on the modernisation of social protection because, in my opinion, it goes in the direction - although not quite there - of finally providing European legislation in the social and pension fields."	it
Now, we believe—and I believe this is the Commission's interpretation—that the entire approximation process, at the level of assessing the acquis aimed at the island's comprehensive integration into the European Union in the event of a future accession, requires the participation, as soon as possible, of the northern communities of the island and the possibility that the European Union, in its efforts to assess the conditions for accession, may also have access to elements that will allow it to substantiate the accession project itself. On the other hand, this means that, on the part of the Council, we must encourage—and I believe this Parliament could do so as well—the Commission's participation in this effort. I believe we cannot fail to send a message of confidence to the Commission regarding its role in this regard. Finally, I believe that we must continue to actively collaborate—and this is also the intention of the Presidency—with the United Nations, given the skill, intelligence, and ability with which the Secretary-General and the United Nations structure itself have been able to guide this debate and, in particular, have sought to contribute to the harmonization of positions between the parties. As I said at the beginning, it is evident that the conclusions of the European Summit in Helsinki in December last year had a clear impact on the evolution of the positions of the various parties in the process. The Government of Nicosia expressed its satisfaction with the Helsinki conclusions, which offer the possibility of accession to the European Union without first resolving the division of the island. However, I cannot help but notice that these same authorities express concern about the pressure they may face to resolve the issues raised by this division, which, as is evident, entail some concessions. This is related to the developments that have taken place regarding population transfers and the possibility of a related reorganization in the event of a different solution for the island. On the other hand, Turkish Cypriots fear—and it's also not worth hiding—that Turkey's candidacy for the European Union will induce Ankara to soften its position on the matter. I believe that, regardless of whether these may be some of the misgivings harbored by the two communities regarding this rapprochement, these aspects, which could lead to a negative interpretation of the situation by the authorities on both sides, could also be the underlying reason for harboring some hope for a final solution. For this final solution, one of the most important elements characterizing relations in that region and in this period will clearly be essential: the extraordinarily positive development of relations between Athens and Ankara and the extremely important role played in them by the Greek Foreign Minister, George Papandreou, and the Turkish Foreign Minister, Ismail Cem. We believe that within this framework, the conditions for a positive development have been created. For our part, as President of the Council, we will continue to closely monitor these developments and will continue to cooperate with the Secretary-General and his personal representative in this regard.	es
Mr Swoboda's balanced and praiseworthy report very concretely supports this surprising and pleasing conclusion. The European Union knows what it has to do in Macedonia: to help this recent regional haven for thousands of war refugees properly play its role as a stimulator of the desired stability pact for the Balkans. Mr President, I have been concerned about the fate of Macedonia for eight years and I would like to contradict Mr Dupuis. What we are doing here is in no way a masterpiece of hypocrisy. We intervened at the right time and I think the Macedonians are very happy about it. So stop being so hateful and water down your wine. I think we should approach this matter in a more positive way. Macedonia did not participate in the war. On the other hand, it suffered greatly from the war its neighbors were waging and from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on them. It is still suffering from this. It also suffered from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war. Therefore, it must also be said that Macedonia's development has, surprisingly enough, continued to evolve on a democratic basis. This is a country that has to overcome serious inter-ethnic problems internally and is succeeding in doing so more and more successfully. I would like to make it clear that we can congratulate Macedonia on having drawn up and now implementing exemplary legislation on respect for minorities. Taking into account the 30% of Albanian speakers in government action, in government policy and in society is the essential condition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia. I am pleased that the wish expressed by Mr Swoboda in his report can be fulfilled at the beginning of March, namely that an EU delegation will finally be established there and that we can finally restore the image of the European Union there. The launch of negotiations on the stability and association process is, in my view, the logical conclusion of the positive developments that have taken place in this country. As part of our political commitment, Macedonia must finally be able to see in practice that its own highly commendable regional cooperation is being rewarded by the effective implementation of regional projects. I will mention just two of a smaller scale: the rapid resolution of the problem of the border crossing into Kosovo at Blace and the development of Corridor 8, which runs from Albania to Bulgaria via Macedonia. I find the report by my colleague Swoboda remarkable and I can only fully support it. Mr President, I too would like to congratulate our colleague Swoboda on his report. I think it is good that so many of us support the approach he has chosen. It is a structural approach to stability in the region and it is also the content of the planned agreement with the Republic of Macedonia that we are debating today. While the practical implementation of the Stability Pact has yet to be initiated, the Commission has moved quickly to finalise the new instrument called the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.	fr
The European Union must exercise all its powers, through all its bodies, to resolve these and other disputes. Mr President, earlier this week, President Prodi announced that full employment would be one of the Commission's strategic objectives for the next five years. He acknowledged that there are currently 15 million Europeans seeking work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion. Moreover, the Portuguese Presidency considers combating unemployment a top priority. But all too often, these political priorities are not reflected in day-to-day politics. A typical case is the Commission's decision to approve the ABB-Alstom merger. The new company has declared its intention to develop a restructuring plan aimed at achieving savings. This global restructuring plan could result in the loss of up to 12,000 jobs. Particularly in my region of the UK, the employment consequences of the merger were severe, as a result of ABB-Alstom's announcement that it would save 270 jobs in the UK, 95 of which would be lost in Stafford and 112 in Rugby. The company's failure to inform the works council of the merger proposals is particularly worrying. This is particularly important in the case of large international companies, where decisions are made remotely from the employee. Point 17 of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation, adding that this applies particularly to companies with establishments in two or more Member States. In my view, this is not just a matter for a Community Charter. EU law could not be clearer on this issue. In such a situation, the Commission would do well to base its decision not simply on whether a merger would distort competition, but also on taking into account the social and economic consequences. We need a more coordinated policy on these issues. What we also urgently need is a study to assess the impact of mergers in every situation. Only in this way will Article 127 of the Treaty be respected. I welcome Commissioner Liikanen's statement, but I also expect the support of this Parliament to ensure that the laws we have adopted on workers' rights are strictly implemented and that assessments of the impact of proposed mergers are taken for granted. I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure. The vote will take place this evening. The debate is closed. (The sitting adjourned at 3:50 p.m. and resumed at 4:05 p.m.) Topic and matter of priority debate The next item is the debate on topical, urgent and major subjects. Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain) The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: B5-0149/2000 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the racist and xenophobic incidents in the El Ejido area (Spain); B5-0159/2000 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Sánchez García, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain); B5-0162/2000 by Mrs Díez González and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the outbreak of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido (Almería);	de
"Unfortunately, the European Commission has already made progress in its guidelines, and Parliament's position carries little weight in the programmes for the 2000-2006 period. However, it is important to stress the need for these funds to prioritize the development of the countries and regions facing the greatest difficulties and the outermost regions, such as the Azores and Madeira regions in Portugal, with a view to achieving economic and social cohesion. The truth is that the Commission's guidelines do not fully meet these objectives. Furthermore, it is important that there be specific guidelines and sufficient funding in the areas of creating quality jobs with rights, as well as the effective promotion of equal rights and opportunities, in support for the social and solidarity economy, rural development, small and medium-sized enterprises, and improving the quality of life of urban populations in disadvantaged areas, particularly in the social housing sector, with a view to sustainable urban development. While the content of Article 158 of the EC Treaty is intended to promote the harmonious development of all the communities, it must be said that the complete elimination of disparities is still a long way off. In some cases, such as the Italian regions falling under Objective 1, these disparities are even paradoxically increasing, above all due to the still weak capacity of the structural apparatus to approach Community procedures and because of the persistent tangle of procedures. Despite regulatory interventions, the flexibility of Community structures still needs to be achieved. Without administrative simplification first, it will be difficult to achieve the Community objectives of reforms characterized by efficiency and concentration. In this sense, the Commission document is deficient, lacking any recommendation to Member States to simplify national procedures and legislation regarding the presentation and examination of projects by national authorities, as well as regarding financing, implementation and control. SMEs, micro-enterprises and craftsmen in particular are still ""weak subjects"" because for them, the legislative and administrative constraints imposed by certain Member States, including Italy, constitute major obstacles to accessing the Structural Funds. A major handicap lies in the inability and impossibility of regions and other subjects to program in time. This is why the Commission, which should have consulted Parliament in time, by virtue of the Decision on the 97/99 Guidelines (Howitt Report), in fact found a kind of easy alibi in the constitution of the reduced programming phase within the Member States and published the Guidelines as early as July 1999, well before the newly elected Parliament began its legislative activities, thus preventing it from acting on the current range of guidelines. The interim evaluation of Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99 will therefore be of significant importance. The current guidelines generally lack the merit of being clear and transparent. However, they only touch on one important issue: the possibility of measuring progress made against verifiable objectives and in full harmony with Community policy strategies. They do not properly address the implications of enlargement, especially since they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications on this matter, either for regional and national authorities or for the candidate countries."	fr
"We all agree in condemning intolerance, but we also agree that we must look ahead, and the culprits need not be sought here, in this Parliament, or in many other parliaments: the culprits for what happened in El Ejido are this minority who wanted to satisfy their thirst for revenge against a few immigrants. But we must bear in mind that solutions never arise from revenge. Solutions must arise from effective cooperation between all authorities, aimed at social integration and respect for all those who work there, from a determined fight against illegal immigration and full respect for the rights of foreign workers working legally in El Ejido and throughout Europe. Mr President, this resolution is about solidarity with the democratic forces in Spain that are fighting for respect for human rights. All Spanish democrats who feel hurt by the events in their country have our full and unconditional support. Not only were immigrants victims of terrible riots, but Spain's democratic system has also been trampled upon, despite the enormous potential for development it has demonstrated over the past 20 years. Immigrant workers are indispensable to employers. Their working conditions are so harsh and inhumane that no Spaniard will accept them. Extremely low wages, a housing shortage—some live in cardboard shacks—a lack of access to social services, an effectively existing apartheid situation—all of this is shameful, unacceptable, and incompatible with the necessary respect for every human being. The events in El Ejido are nothing other than racist and xenophobic practices that are no longer permissible in today's Europe. The persecution of immigrants lasted four days. Women and children were beaten. Hundreds of immigrants, who had fled from all over, have taken refuge on a hill on the outskirts of the city. It is right to place Haider's Austria on the Index, but we must equally not tolerate small, local ""Haiders"" pursuing a policy of racist exclusion and ruthless economic domination. What happened in Spain could happen in all our Union countries if we are not vigilant. We all have a duty to clean up our own backyards. I support this motion for a resolution, in particular the paragraphs referring to Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, as well as paragraph 11 of this resolution, which establishes a link between the Structural Funds and the fight against exclusion. It would be a credit to the European Parliament to firmly condemn these events and support all proposals for respect for migrant workers in Spain and throughout the Union. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the flames of racist and xenophobic violence are flaring up in the heart of Europe today. This violence is being fueled everywhere by extremist movements that are gaining influence. We must now take concrete measures to put an end to such violations of physical integrity. None of our societies in Europe can fully develop if there is a risk of hatred erupting among one part of its population against another."	de
I can only call on the Conference of Presidents to reach an agreement as quickly as possible on the correct comitological procedure for citations. This would considerably facilitate the future work of the rapporteurs of this House. A proposal for an amendment has also been put forward to the two reports by our colleague Mr De Palacio. I must unfortunately say that I will not be able to support this proposal because it affects the substance of the result we unanimously reached in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and I would like to adhere to this result, which was the result of lengthy discussions. In conclusion, I would like to thank all my colleagues who supported me in the Committee on Legal Affairs during the preparation of these reports, which were not exactly easy. I would particularly like to mention Mr Wieland, who assumed the thankless role of shadow rapporteur and who played a much greater role than is customary in the preparation of this report, contributing excellent and constructive ideas, without being able to take the laurels of rapporteurship. That is why I wanted to emphasize this point in this chamber. Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity, following the intervention of the rapporteur, Mrs Berger, to make some preliminary remarks before listening, with all due attention, to the following speakers and, if you will allow me, Mr President, to examine the individual amendments in more detail at the end of the debate. May I say that the Commission welcomes the support shown by the European Parliament for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services for third-country national workers, the subject we are currently debating? I particularly thank Mrs Berger for the work she has devoted to dealing with these two proposals, which are politically sensitive and legally challenging. I also wish to sincerely thank Mrs Palacio for the important contribution she has made as Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. The Commission particularly welcomes Parliament's suggestions for a more efficient procedure for issuing the services card. If the option is offered to apply for this card for one, several, or all Member States, the procedure becomes even more flexible. The Commission also agrees with the proposal to relax the validity period of the card. However, I believe that a period of three months of work is insufficient to prove that a worker is established in a Member State. The Commission can also approve the determination of cases in which an employment contract concluded between a service provider and his employee is abruptly terminated. The efficiency of the procedure for issuing this card means that companies providing cross-border services can genuinely exercise their rights within the territory of the internal market. We believe it is excessive to grant other Member States, for reasons of public policy, the systematic possibility of carrying out checks for the purpose of issuing a card.	fr
"To further strengthen the European Union's role in international development policy, we consider it fundamentally necessary to develop three types of measures. The first concerns increasing the effectiveness of its development policy. As is known, an overall evaluation of development policy was carried out in 1995, and a summary of this overall evaluation was presented during the German Presidency. The main conclusions emphasize the need for a more coherent European Union policy and a general strategic vision of development problems within the European Union. Particular emphasis is placed on the need for closer coordination and greater complementarity of measures, the harmonization and simplification of the organizational framework within which the Union's cooperation policy currently takes place, more effective aid management, and a review of its intervention mechanisms in particular, as well as the need to expand the evaluation system and to be more transparent about how this aid is used. A second aspect would be the need for greater complementarity between the European Union and the policies of individual Member States. As is well known, a significant proportion of aid is currently deployed through the actions of the Member States, which are not always complementary and coordinated. And it is precisely this inability to coordinate and ensure complementarity between the Member States' projects and the actions planned and implemented by the European Union institutions that is largely responsible for the wasted or ineffective use of aid from within the European Union. We also believe that it is essential that we are in a position, in the near future, to do everything possible to develop mechanisms for complementarity and coordination between the policies pursued by the Member States and those of the European Union. A third aspect that deserves emphasis is the strengthening and coherence of their policies, which is the central theme of today's debate. First and foremost, we are all aware that it is not enough to create more favourable conditions for aid; what is needed is better integration of it with other European Union actions, so that development objectives can be achieved not only through aid and assistance, but above all through a more integrated view of the individual actions contributing to them. As is well known, a Council resolution was adopted in June 1997, and the Commission undertook to submit evaluation reports. The first report was submitted to the Council in May 1999, and it already sets out some aspects of the coordination of policies, particularly in the areas of peacekeeping, food security, fisheries, and migration. However, as is also known, a Commission communication on coherence is expected to accompany the communication on ""development policy."" Of course, the contributions that the Commission intends to present on this topic in the coming months, even during the Portuguese Presidency, can also be incorporated into this debate. It is clear that policy coherence will always remain limited, and a certain degree of inconsistency between policies is also an element of balance and balancing of the contradictory and opposing interests at work within the Union. Only in this way is it possible to address a certain degree of inconsistency between policies."	de
This was never our intention. The fact that we are opening negotiations first and foremost with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shows that we can and do differentiate. With regard to the regional aid mentioned in the report, we also believe that our technical and financial support should also benefit, among other things, projects with a cross-border or regional dimension. We support the inclusion of an evolution clause on the accession perspective in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Such a clause reflects the European Union's position on its relations with the Western Balkan countries, as set out in the conclusions of the Cologne European Council. We also consider the greatest possible decentralisation of our aid programmes to be necessary. As Members of the House are aware, we are currently drafting a new regulation regarding European Union assistance to the Western Balkan countries in order to simplify and streamline the management of the programmes and to consolidate all measures into one regulation. I know that there is concern in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere about the end of the PHARE programme in those countries, and in particular about the abandonment of the PHARE name. I note with considerable concern what Members have said on this issue. I will look again at this issue, although I would point out that having two PHARE programmes can really cause confusion. I would like to stress, however, that our support for the integration of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and its neighbouring countries into the European family, whatever the name of the programme, is greater than ever. I am sure that Members of this House share my delight that Macedonia has reached this stage in a relatively short space of time. I hope that the other countries in the region will redouble their efforts to be able to make similar progress. I look forward to the further debates we will have on this subject in the coming years, and I hope that the successes of our efforts in the Balkans will be a central focus, because for me the Balkans are a touchstone of what Europe can achieve on its own doorstep. Thank you, Commissioner Patten. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. Agreement on committee procedures The next item is the report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the procedures for implementing the new Council Decision of 28 June 1999 - 'comitology' (1999/468/EC). Mr President, by adopting this agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the procedures for implementing the Council decision on comitology, we are bringing to a close a matter that has occupied Parliament and a number of passionate advocates of this issue, scattered throughout the various institutions of the European Union and openly described by some as masochists, for about two years. Since 1993, the procedures for exercising the implementing powers conferred on the Commission, and in particular the inscrutable and even dubious committee system, have sown discord and mistrust between the institutions, which threatened to have serious repercussions for the legislative process.	de
As is known, the Commission should have already submitted, by 1998, new proposals on the revision of Directive 97/67 on postal services, aimed at guaranteeing the maintenance of the universal service, ensuring its economic sustainability, normalising the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market and taking into account the repercussions on the categories concerned, including workers and users. To this end, the Commission has had studies carried out on the cost of universal service, the consequences of the liberalisation of cross-border and advertising postal services, the repercussions of the reduction of the weight and value limits of the exclusive sector, the impact of the liberalisation of the remaining phases - beyond distribution - of the postal service, and the overall assessment of the results of the studies. Mr President, the question therefore arises - and, in the absence of Commissioner Bolkestein, I ask the expert Commissioner Monti, who I believe will wish to express his opinion - why not examine, in these studies, the socio-economic impact of the various foreseeable scenarios for liberalisation in each of the Member States? Indeed, postal services are very different in Greece, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands or Belgium. Following liberalisation, how will the universal postal service be financed and operated properly in a country like mine, Greece, which has a particular morphology of the territory, taking into account the numerous islands, often inhabited? How will the body responsible for the universal postal service survive in my country once the cross-border service, which in Greece corresponds to 25 percent and elsewhere to less than 5 percent, has been liberalised? How will the transfer of the national sector to a foreign country, which Mr McCartin also mentioned, be managed? Since this is a very likely eventuality, given that technological progress is making it increasingly simple and profitable, we should consider further liberalisation, gradually and controlled, with the relative setting of weight and value limits. But what will these limits be? Will companies - always skilled at selective exploitation - perhaps be granted the right to easily circumvent the weight limits, given that it is not possible to check the content of letters? In any case, Mr President and Commissioner, we ask the Commission to show its cards and to present its proposals, analysing the foreseeable developments from every point of view and for all Member States. It goes without saying that liberalisation is not an end in itself, but only a means to improve services. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposed liberalisation of traditional national postal services inevitably leads to the question of what activities the post office will consider its core business in the future. In other words: what services will the post office want to continue to offer? What activities will it be able to carry out jointly at international level? What areas will it intend to divest? In order to answer this question, it must be borne in mind that the old monopoly is no longer a de facto monopoly following the emergence of numerous courier services and the introduction of technological developments such as fax and e-mail. On the other hand, employment is of fundamental importance in the case of the liberalisation of postal services.	it
I would like to know what Europe and you, Mr Solana, are doing now, or intend to do in the near future, to avert this threat of war: it can still be prevented today - tomorrow it may already be too late. I would also like to know whether, in this context, something could not be done to encourage the Iraqi Government to make a humanitarian gesture, that is, to provide information on the whereabouts of the 615 missing Kuwaitis or, if they are in its power, to release them. As we sit here, hundreds of thousands of people are in grave danger because of the floods in Mozambique. This did not happen suddenly. The floods have been going on for weeks, and only now does the need for action seem to have arisen. The practical support from the Community and the Member States has so far been more than modest. For some time, many of us have warned that the European Union is spending too much time on its potentially dangerous and essentially political project of creating military decision-making structures, instead of concentrating its efforts on improving its civilian instruments, particularly for humanitarian aid. I acknowledge Mr. Patten's efforts in this direction, but it is very regrettable that the governments of the Member States have not invested as much time in analyzing their capacities for disaster relief and humanitarian aid as they have in the dangerous business of creating military capacities that ultimately only create structures parallel to NATO and thus undermine it. Of course, there is a connection between the availability of equipment and personnel and humanitarian aid, but serious deficiencies in the military sphere exist in the armed forces of many European countries and have existed for some time. NATO has set about addressing these. So far, I have not heard a convincing security policy explanation as to why the European Union must establish autonomous, decision-making capacities for the deployment of armed forces outside NATO structures if it does not want to create bodies that will compete with NATO. After all, the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit at the table in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. NATO is predominantly European in character. In conclusion, I would simply like to ask you, Mr Solana, what is the point of having the much-heralded strategic planning and early warning unit in the Council Secretariat when we are caught completely by surprise when another humanitarian catastrophe befalls us? Mr President, Mr High Representative, Mr Commissioner, we have noted the particularly reserved and almost complacent attitude of the international community in general, and the European Union in particular, towards the war in Chechnya. What has happened and is still happening in Chechnya is comparable to genocide. How else can one describe the complete destruction of a regional capital with 400,000 inhabitants, the incessant and excessive shelling of towns, villages, and residential areas where the entire civilian population was present—perhaps mixed with a few Chechen fighters? What should one call the shameful concentration camp-like filtration camps in which the population is subjected to the worst humiliations and from which healthy men between the ages of 15 and 65 rarely emerge alive?	de
I share his impatience to ensure the full implementation of reform mechanisms and change practices. I wish I could tell him honestly that we will be drafting and presenting communication proposals before 2001 and certainly implementing them before 2002, but he should know that consultation procedures and deadlines are legally required and we must respect them. I do not use that as an excuse. The very positive and constructive response resulting from the consultation last month gives us great encouragement, and I believe, therefore, that although there may be a slight delay in compiling and implementing the reforms, they will nevertheless be strengthened by the breadth of understanding and commitment that will result from this consultation, which we will conduct assiduously. I would like to see it all happen much more quickly. It had better be done absolutely properly. Madam President, we admire Mr. Kinnock's vision and realism because, while he holds out the promise of a successful and perfectly functioning administration, he does not fail to highlight the difficulties that will arise and which we must already expect. Mr. Prodi pointed out that he wanted to disengage from certain tasks. Policy priorities will therefore have to be defined. I think it is more important to first determine what we want to do before disengaging, to avoid alienating a large number of people. That is my opinion. Furthermore, the enlargement of the Union is one of the major challenges. I would also like to point out that maintaining peace will require greater efforts to involve a greater number of people in this area. The rather bureaucratic approach we are currently experiencing, particularly in our overall development cooperation, will have to resolutely give way to cooperation for peace. Can Mr. Kinnock explain what he expects from the Council and Parliament regarding the timing of such priorities? I thank Mrs. Maes not only for the statement she has just made, but also for the continued commitment she has shown to change since she joined this House. I would like to assure her that our behavior is not guided by any desire to shirk certain tasks. We are focusing on essential tasks, on priorities, not with the aim of evading any obligation, but to absolutely guarantee that we can fully meet the central obligations we have. One of these obligations is very clear—and I agree with Mrs. Maes here—and that is the preparation for an effective, serene, and smooth enlargement, an enlargement that will serve the mutual interests of both the peoples of the acceding countries and the citizens of the existing Union. Ensuring that we are able to fulfil this absolutely critical role as agents of the widest possible enlargement is one of the reasons why we must ensure that we focus very strongly and very intensely on our priorities.	fr
There is no equivocal silence from the Council on this matter, Mr Wurtz. The Council assumes full responsibility for its reading of the situation in Cyprus. It was this situation and this reading that led it, in Luxembourg at the end of 1997, to initiate the process of the Republic of Cyprus's accession to the European Union. I would like you to understand that, regardless of the more or less emotional decisions taken on this type of issue, the daily routine of international negotiations normally requires governments, and I say governments, I mean all governments, to have a slightly more flexible reading. We need, in fact, more emotional positions to maintain the scenario in which all these issues are projected on the human level. But we must also bear in mind that it is thanks to the rational nature of political positions and flexibility in negotiation that we can find solutions that will enable us to overcome major differences, which have ultimately been the cause of some of the great tragedies in history. Regardless of the culprits—we are not here to draw up a list of culprits; the relevant UN resolutions in this area are clear—I believe that we must take advantage, without emotion and with greater rationality, of the opportunities offered by the new situation. The Helsinki European Council had the courage to take certain decisions, and I believe that various parts of these decisions already take due account of these opportunities to the extent that they can, as I said at the beginning of my opening remarks, constitute a window of opportunity. It is not by exploiting tensions in this phase of negotiations, which is a delicate, sensitive phase, that we will be able to achieve concrete results. It is precisely through discreet work, work in support of the mission of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations that we must continue. The European Union's position on this matter is unequivocal, ladies and gentlemen, and I believe that it is not worthwhile to engage in second readings on possible sentences that might be found in the Council's speech or in another position. We are not, in this Parliament, playing for political correctness; we are playing for what is right internationally and for what are the concrete positions defined by the Council, for a long time and consistently, and which the European Commission has also followed with prudence, attention and pragmatism. When we speak at this time of the need to involve the community of the northern part of Cyprus in an exchange of information, particularly on the path towards the future accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, we must be aware that we are trying to find formulas of a practical nature that will allow us to overcome the obstacles on the path to a political solution. We are not looking for subterfuges and we are not seeking to create, through practical solutions, any models that present recognition of a political nature.	fr
Technical assistance is still needed, however. Particular attention should also be paid to disseminating results and mutual learning through best practices and mainstreaming. I have ensured that this report receives the broadest possible support. This objective led to a reduction in the number of amendments – from 100 in committee to 22 in plenary – which has opened up numerous opportunities for compromise. We even managed to reach a compromise on the issue of asylum seekers. In this connection, however, I ask Madam President to hold the vote on the EQUAL report on Wednesday instead of Tuesday, so that we can still work on some details. I believe it is important that this Community initiative can begin on time and that this report enjoys broad support in this House, so that the Commission is also obliged to take Parliament's constructive proposals into consideration. The resources allocated to EQUAL have in fact been set aside by the European Parliament so that the expectations of parliamentarians can also be reflected in the Community initiative. In this regard, the European Parliament's insistence that any amendment to the essential points can only take place after a new hearing by the House is also justified. EQUAL must deserve its name; that is my firm intention. It must guarantee equal opportunities for all disadvantaged people in the European Union. It must prevent the dislocation of our society. It must prevent marginalisation from becoming a part of everyday life. It must offer everyone the opportunity to benefit from a common initiative, regardless of their age, gender or origin. That is my intention, and I ask this House to give this report its broadest support. Madam President, the fact that we are holding this debate on the new Urban Initiative is an achievement in itself, as is my presence here with you this evening, since Air France cancelled my flight at 2:10 p.m., but I am here! Exactly a year ago, when the Commission presented its Agenda 2000 proposals, it scrapped the Urban Initiative. Yet we, as politicians, knew that there was strong support for continuing the initiative in the year 2000. Therefore, Parliament can claim to have waged a productive lobbying campaign to put Urban back on the agenda and to have succeeded in changing the minds of the Commission and the Council. Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy. In my Member State, for example, we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper, and a government task force on urban development is examining the problems of urban communities. Eight out of ten people in Europe live in urban areas, so it's only right that we help our most disadvantaged communities address the all-too-familiar problems of deprivation, social exclusion, unemployment, crime, drug abuse, and all the issues that come with them. For example, in my area of Manchester, the Urban Community Initiative has been successful.	fr
"Above all, integration mechanisms should be created. Perhaps most important is the development of an infrastructure capable of enhancing the participation of non-expansive sectors and peripheral population groups. Therefore, I believe that investments should be made in computer equipment for primary schools, a broadband network for sparsely populated areas, public technology libraries, and a public sector that must not be diminished but, on the contrary, strengthened. Mr President, the agenda for the European Council in Lisbon, which will take place on 23 and 24 March, is enough to make one dizzy. This is true, for example, of the chapter headings alone, which mention a Europe of innovation and knowledge, structural reforms, competitiveness, the European social model, employment, social cohesion, macroeconomic policies, and sustainable economic growth. It is therefore not surprising that, among the numerous contributions by the Presidency, the Commission, and the Member States, there is a tendency at the moment to disperse in all directions. This approach could lead to two entirely different outcomes: either it would facilitate a comprehensive exchange of highly stimulating ideas, which each would then attempt to implement in its own country, perhaps leading to joint action in the new field of electronic commerce—and this possibility would not be such a bad thing after all—or the Council would be keen to produce results that would transfer further powers to Europe, which would mean even more centralization and bureaucracy, precisely the opposite of what is actually needed. Reading the preparatory documents, we have some concerns about this. They suggest—forgive this gibberish, which is not my own—that there is a need for better convergence between the Cologne Process on the coordination of macroeconomic policies, the Cardiff Process on structural reforms, and the Luxembourg Process on the coordination of employment policies, while also giving substance to the Employment Pact and the multilateral surveillance of budgetary policies. How can such better convergence of all these different processes be ensured? The conclusion of the Council Presidency document of January 12 provides the key. The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines—which currently have the status of mere annual recommendations from the Council to the Member States—need to be reformed to broaden their scope and, above all, to further develop their character as a framework document. The word ""framework"" is obviously intended here to have a dual meaning: summary and commitment. With these comprehensive documents, aren't we reinventing the GOSPLAN? This question is legitimate, especially when one reads the French contribution, which goes even further toward dirigisme by proposing that a whole range of national policies, for example, in the areas of employment, social protection, and SMEs, be coordinated in Brussels and that a host of quantified indicators be set, which would then have to be monitored. Such centralised control would lead to further breaches of the principle of subsidiarity, to further standardisation of details, to further coordination imposed on the countries despite their different situations, and ultimately to new rigid rules in addition to those in the area of the single currency."	de
"Italy, for example, has encountered difficulties in the use of structural funds in recent years, mainly due to excessive bureaucracy, a lack of information and the almost complete absence of involvement of economic and social operators at local level. There are therefore two points to which I would like to draw the Commission's attention: first, it is important to make the best use of consultation as an instrument for coordination and participation in the decisions of local and regional operators, precisely with the aim of avoiding imbalances and inequalities. Second, it is essential to simplify and make more transparent administrative processes, which too often are so long and unnecessarily complex that they hinder access to funds, something that European small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly concerned about. I conclude, Mr President, by stating that it is rather serious that the Commission, in its communication, has paid little attention to territorial pacts and, above all, to the methods for combating unemployment among women and young people. Mr President, like my colleague, Mr Evans, I am delighted that my maiden speech to this House is on such an important subject, particularly because I represent a part of the UK, the West Midlands, which has so far benefited from Objective 2 funding. But the report before Parliament this evening is a prime example of how, if we are not careful, we can create ideas that sound grandiose but lack the substance to be relevant to the people who directly benefit from them. The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often happens when we deal with these matters, lacks clarity about its purpose and a sound basis for its operation. That is why my group and I are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text. This is not about taking anything away from the proposal but about making it more relevant to those it is intended to guide. Let me explain our thinking. First, we are concerned about the proper use of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. Past experience shows that we should and must, as elected representatives of European taxpayers, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and monitoring of the allocated sums. Our amendments and additions are therefore aimed at establishing indicators of what is known as ""value for money"" in the process of granting credits. Second, we see all too often that enormous sums are spent on projects whose outcome is inevitably uncertain at the beginning of the programme period. But halfway through or at the end of that period, there is no effective way to terminate the project if it has not proven successful. Our additions therefore require the provision of practical and implementable exit strategies, so that not only can we have the necessary insurance against ongoing costs that taxpayers often have to bear, but we can also avoid the syndrome of getting stuck in a bad deal. Finally, we call for a change in the balance and method of disbursement of funds."	fr
I would also like to praise the Council's sensible and flexible attitude. Save The next item is the report by Mrs Ahern (A5-0010/2000), on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme to promote energy efficiency - Save (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD)). Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for the successful and thorough conduct of the conciliation procedure, during which a good atmosphere prevailed throughout, which is not always the case. I am pleased to say that I consider the final result very satisfactory for Parliament, since all its amendments have been incorporated in full or in revised form into the joint text. The financial resources ultimately allocated to the programme also represent a significant improvement on the Council's proposal at second reading, which we considered totally unacceptable; we did make some progress there. I therefore propose that this House accept the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion of the conciliation at third reading. I would remind the House that at second reading we adopted this report with eight amendments, including the reinstatement of the amount originally proposed by the Commission. The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments, including the appropriations, and I thank the Commission for its continued support on the budgetary issue during the conciliation procedure, as the Council's proposal was unacceptable. During the conciliation process, agreement was reached on the studies and actions to prepare, implement, supplement, and evaluate Community action. Furthermore, compromise wording was found for five other amendments, including legislative and non-legislative measures, the inclusion of local energy centers, and—very importantly—energy balance systems in monitoring progress in energy efficiency. I hope you all agree that this is a tremendous step forward. On the issue of funding, Parliament staunchly defended its position in the face of the Council's extremely meager initial offer. We had to hold several meetings on this before the Council finally increased the appropriations to a significant amount. We secured an increase of EUR 2 million over the initial amount, which represents a substantial increase in the budget. I can commend this budget to you, and the Commission has promised to follow it in implementing the program. This played an important role in our deliberations. However, I would like to make it clear that this is and always has been a very modest budget, and that the funding is more symbolic than it reflects real needs. The financing of energy savings still comes largely from the Member States. We must keep this in mind when we adopt this program. If what we can achieve at the Community level is more symbolic than real, that's unfortunate, because there's a lot of enthusiasm at the local level for energy-saving measures, including Community measures. But the Community can do one thing: bring local stakeholders together, so that the wheel isn't reinvented in every region.	de
Considering that the European Social Fund's contribution for the period 2000-2006 will amount to 2.487 billion euros and that the EQUAL initiative is jointly financed with the Member States, what will Greece's contribution rate be? - (EL) The EQUAL initiative is not limited to specific groups of people. It aims to address discrimination in the workplace. The decision to launch this initiative was taken in Berlin, and there it was decided that it would take into consideration and include in its actions the occupational groups of asylum seekers. I mention this as an important aspect of this initiative. The Community Initiative Programme of each Member State must comply with regulations, which are the same as the regulations of the European Social Fund; in other words, the EQUAL initiative complies with the regulations of the European Social Fund. It has been submitted to Parliament, and we await Parliament's opinion next month. I must emphasize that the EQUAL initiative responds to national needs and national plans, which are defined in accordance with the agreed European strategy. National governments are primarily responsible for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the people who will implement the programs—and also for oversight in the first instance. Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Employment has responsibility for implementation, while financial oversight will, of course, be exercised by the Directorate-General for Financial Control, as well as by the European Anti-Fraud Office and the Court of Auditors. The final question concerns the amount granted. Greece has been granted 98 million ECUs, and the mandatory participation is 80%, while for the island regions, and especially the more remote Greek islands, the initiative's participation reaches 85%, with a corresponding share of 15%. Mr. President, I am of the opinion that the guidelines for the Community initiative EQUAL, and especially the four actions described therein, lead to a very complex and, paradoxically, opaque bureaucratic structure. For example, one wonders how a development partnership can demonstrate its spirit of collaboration or capacity for representation, as stated in Action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines. Furthermore, the mandatory nature of interstate collaboration and the complex requirements for planning and implementing a development partnership inevitably lead to large organizations, which are the only ones capable of meeting such demands. This, however, contradicts the proclaimed intention of the general objectives, which contemplate decentralized action plans, specifically in the area of local government and rural areas. Moreover, at the same time, it makes the participation of the truly most disadvantaged—such as asylum seekers, migrants, and others—impossible or merely symbolic. Finally, considering the overall amount, which is rather small—2.8 billion euros for 15 countries and such ambitious targets—I fear that all we will ultimately achieve is to demonstrate that unemployment is a very bad thing. (EL) First of all, I would say that since we are at the stage of being drafted by Parliament, it will really help us a lot if we receive concrete proposals, which we will take into consideration. Secondly, I have to say that the objective of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment. This initiative cannot address the issue of reducing unemployment, nor can it address support for job creation.	es
The Commission has been urged, and will do so in the first half of next year, to submit a report on the progress of the transposition of the decision into the Member States' domestic law, and also on whether the seriousness of the matter is reflected in the actions of the States. It has already been pointed out that this framework decision is a decision adopted in the field of criminal law. To that extent, this novelty, this step, must be acknowledged, even though you, Mr. Schulz, have indicated that supplementing such an old Convention is not a very bold step. Regarding your question as to whether, in the Commission's view, the framework decision rests on a legal basis that is sufficiently market-based: in the Commission's view, the correct legal basis is applied. Furthermore, the framework decision must be supplemented in the future by other legal acts. The Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all competent authorities and cooperation with Europol. This proposal should establish an obligation to cooperate and regulate the obligation of national authorities to report cases of counterfeit currency and to hand over seized counterfeit currency to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, so that effective action can be taken. On the issue of coordination of the various measures: since the beginning of 1998, the Commission (and henceforth, OLAF will do so) has been collaborating with experts in the field from the Member States, the European Central Bank, and Europol to combat counterfeiting early and effectively. On the Commission's side, a few weeks ago, Mr. Karras, as you have already pointed out, a proposal was presented for an information campaign on the euro, to which at least €32 million would be allocated. This is a volume of resources that can be effectively deployed, in other words, a large volume of resources; of course, the protection of the euro against counterfeiting will occupy a prominent place in this information campaign. I believe that this debate also contributes to warning all counterfeiters who think their time has come at this very late hour because the EU is no longer awake, thanks to this debate shortly before midnight. Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00. (The sitting was suspended at 11:50 p.m.) Resumption of the sitting. The minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments? (The minutes were approved) Mr. President, I wish to make a comment concerning a meeting that took place last night between several Members of this Parliament, regardless of group. Several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors participated in it, and the architects who built this Chamber were also present, to seek ways of further improving the conditions under which our work is carried out. We discovered, at that meeting, that the curtain behind you, Mr. President, actually hides a large window. Now, it seems that if it were opened, we could contemplate a magnificent spectacle over the river; but we were told that it was kept closed to avoid backlighting, so that the chamber would be better illuminated during the debates.	es
"The size, unpredictability, and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets are making it increasingly difficult to control economies at the national and regional levels. Computer-controlled sales programs were enough to transform a random flash on a screen into an avalanche burying jobs, lives, and entire industries in every corner of the globe. The only arguments against this are: First, the efficiency of the foreign exchange markets would be compromised—hardly imaginable, given the enormous pace at which capital is moved back and forth, accompanied by the destruction of jobs throughout the world, in East Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Mr. Chirac once described those involved in this business as the AIDS virus of the global economy. We need to throw a little sand in the gears of currency speculators, stockbrokers, and options traders. Of course, this cannot be achieved by any single country or monetary union, but it is possible at the international level and through global cooperation. Europe, Japan, and the United States, the euro, the yen, and the dollar, would, in my view, constitute such a bloc. I am disappointed with the PPE. I thought the members would at least read the resolutions they are about to vote on. Yes, I support such a tax, but we will not be voting on that tomorrow. Tomorrow we will simply decide whether to task the Commission with investigating this area and examining what steps and conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax. As far as I understand, the Commissioner also opposes such a tax. However, I cannot understand why he does not welcome a study on this topic, since the results could ultimately support his position. There is nothing worse than a preconceived opinion. According to a survey by ""War on Want,"" 47% of all citizens in the United Kingdom support this tax. In France, this proposal has met with an overwhelming response, particularly in relation to the call for the revenue to be used to reduce debt and alleviate poverty in developing countries. This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament, the Council, and the Commission. A large part of the public now demands a better answer than: ""There has never been a tax like this before."" In the new millennium, with its new problems that require global solutions, citizens demand sound arguments as to why such a tax cannot be introduced at present, and they do not want to hear the reasons that have previously opposed it. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a political compromise resolution on the benefits of taxing international financial transactions would be a first step toward the essential overhaul of numerous international regulations. One of the main demands of the protesters in Seattle was precisely the introduction of this type of tax, and this is no coincidence. Proposing it now would be a strong signal from the rich European countries that they are willing to abandon their selfish attitude, Commissioner. In everyone's view, such a solidarity tax is a laudable measure that does not hinder trade but primarily targets speculative transactions and their harmful effects, distinguished colleagues from the right-wing parties."	de
Does the Commission intend to adopt an action plan to increase women's active participation in environmental decision-making? Since 1988, the Commission has had an action plan for equal opportunities for women and men. The current program, which runs from 1997 to 2000, aims to develop a culture that integrates masculine and feminine values and takes into account the specific needs of each sex. One of the program's objectives is to prepare and monitor methods, strategies, and measures that promote equitable distribution of the sexes in decision-making processes, including senior positions. Within the framework of this program, each Directorate-General prepares a specific action plan. One of the objectives of the action plan is to increase the number of women in management positions. The new Commission aims to double the number of women in management positions during its term of office. The Directorate-General for the Environment, where currently 60 percent of directors and 20 percent of department heads are women, is particularly active in this area. Our policy is to encourage the incorporation of women into administrative positions, in order to create a pool of suitable candidates for future management positions. Currently, 24.5 percent of our category A employees are women. We hope that this proportion will continue to grow. In addition, we make efforts to attract qualified women to participate in our discussion forums. As for our external partners, we can only set good examples and urge them to make efforts to democratize their decision-making processes. Regarding more general issues regarding the integration of the perspective of equal opportunities between men and women, you are surely aware that this principle is enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. Article 3 of the Treaty stipulates that the Community, in all matters relating to that article, shall aim to eliminate deficiencies and promote equal opportunities for men and women. The Commission supports the efforts being made in this area and is studying what specific measures can be adopted in environmental matters. Obviously, I would like to take this opportunity to say that I value the role of the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and, especially, that of its President. Let me just recall that when the current Committee was approved, the Committee on Women's Rights asked each Commissioner how they would address equal opportunities between men and women in their area of work. We will closely monitor each of the Commissioners; in this way, I want to warn the others as well. Thank you for your reply. I interpret it as a yes, as a necessary action plan; an action plan to incorporate more women in specific environmental fields. Let me also say that the Beijing Declaration underlines the importance of having the institutional capacity to include the equal opportunities perspective in all environmental programs.	es
"Now that things are clear, we must hope that the improved climate in relations between the European Union and Turkey and in Greek-Turkish relations will have a positive impact on the Turkish Cypriot community and that it will lift its refusal to send representatives to the accession negotiations. The presence of such representatives would in no way prejudge the final political solution. Quite the contrary. It would enable the interests of all to be promoted at a time when Cyprus, by joining the European Union, is about to take a decisive turn in its history. Mr President, I would also like to join the other speakers in expressing joy at the improved opportunities for the continued development of Cyprus as relations between Turkey and the EU and between Turkey and Greece improve. The EU must, in my view, contribute constructively to this development. I also believe - and this point has already been mentioned - that certain problems relating to the Financial Regulation need to be resolved. I am referring here to the pre-accession appropriations, which I believe fall under heading 7. Last year, the House exceptionally agreed to place the appropriations for this expenditure under heading 4, so that Cyprus and Malta are not treated as equals with the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe, although they should be, in accordance with the declarations made at the Helsinki Summit. Resources must therefore be allocated under heading 7, for which the Financial Perspective will have to be revised. That is the salient point. It is essential that the appropriations for pre-accession aid for Cyprus and Malta come from heading 7 and that the Financial Perspective is revised, because if the Council rejects this principle, it will be acting in contradiction with its own decisions taken in Helsinki in December. As for the amount in the Brok report – EUR 130 million – I would like to state, on behalf of the Liberal Group, that we must first negotiate the size of this amount. The main thing here is to ensure a multiannual programme, which falls under the appropriate heading, in order to begin preparations for the accession of Cyprus and Malta. Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the decision adopted by the Helsinki European Council that the resolution of the conflict cannot be a prerequisite for the accession of Cyprus. Strong pressure must be maintained on the Cypriot government, but the will of the majority of the population cannot be blackmailed by another part of it, even if we have serious doubts about the representativeness of the government of this part of the island. It is clear that the window of opportunity – the ""janela de oportunidades"" (window of opportunity) of which the Presidency spoke – must be exploited to the fullest. However, we are also convinced that although Greek-Turkish relations have improved, this cannot be enough."	fr
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) This proposal for a directive aims to establish the conditions for the posting of third-country nationals employed in the context of cross-border provision of services. Third-country nationals legally resident in a Member State do not enjoy the right to free movement within the European Union. Until now, non-EU workers have been seriously hampered by obstacles to their free movement within the European Union. It is therefore positive that the movement of workers within the European Union is being facilitated, even if they are third-country nationals. However, the proposal for a directive only concerns their movement to another Member State if they are posted on behalf of an employer established in a country where they have their habitual residence, so that the possibility of movement is limited to the period of posting, and only in the Member State to which they were posted. This means that the fundamental concern of this proposal is not to solve the problem of the movement of these workers but only to create better conditions for companies providing services. On the other hand, the Berger report introduces, in the name of simplifying procedures, far-reaching and questionable changes, in particular the creation of a common information system giving access to cards issued by the authorities of all Member States Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger Report (A5-0012/2000) . It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives which aim to facilitate the free movement of workers who are nationals of third countries while also facilitating the free movement of services. Essentially, these proposals introduce the EC/Services Card, which will enable nearly 5 million third-country nationals legally resident in a Member State of the European Union to provide services in other Member States in the future, something currently hampered by problems such as obtaining visas and work permits. The first proposal for a directive will allow companies established in a Member State that employ third-country national workers to temporarily post those employees to another Member State to provide services. Under the proposed provisions, the employer would simply be required to apply for a Services Card for each worker concerned. Logically, to be eligible for such a card, the worker must be legally resident in a Member State and covered by a social security scheme. The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed third-country nationals. While I agree with the European Commission's proposals in substance, it is true that some provisions could be confusing. This is why I am voting in favor of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur. This will clarify the provisions and thus prevent any abuse! Other amendments aim to simplify administrative procedures, for example by allowing Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards. Such a change seemed essential to me to avoid the administrative burdens that too often hamper the proper implementation of new provisions.	fr
That is precisely our task for the Balkans. The Union must demonstrate to the Balkans and the rest of the world its ability to expand the area of security, peace, and freedom and to assume a leading role on the world stage. We will, of course, return once again to enlargement, which must be achieved by simultaneously expanding the area of security, peace, and freedom. We have promised much in this direction, but I believe we can keep our promises, even though an extremely difficult road lies ahead. The enlargement that will accompany us for the entire five years and beyond—I am thinking of the hopes of the candidate countries—must be based on secure and objective criteria, but we must also offer guarantees to the citizens of those countries and, even more so, to our own citizens. Enlargement will be characterized by friendship, impartiality, and openness, but also by a lack of compromise. I repeat: we must offer guarantees to the citizens of the candidate countries, but even more so to the public in our own countries. Our responsibility does not end with enlargement, nor does it end with the Balkans. There are several other crucial problems: our relationship with Ukraine, our relationship with Russia, our relationship with our neighboring countries, and the major problem of our relationship with the southern Mediterranean, which will be crucial for Europe's history and for the peace and security of future European generations. In this sense, we have a responsibility towards the entire African continent. Hopes have recently been pinned on Africa; offers have been made to Africa, but nothing concrete has yet been achieved there. In recent years, Africa has not seen a transition from totalitarian to democratic regimes, but rather the reverse, from democracy to totalitarianism. For us, Africa is a worrying source of conflict. We therefore have another task to fulfil at the international level, one already mentioned by the Commissioner responsible for Trade: we must work for the resumption of the Millennium Round, with the comprehensive willingness we had already adopted and proposed before Seattle, but which we were unable to put into practice – the willingness to address some problems of fundamental importance to the poorest countries, concerning not only debt relief but also the unilateral opening of trade with the world's poorest countries. We must find another solution, otherwise events like those in Seattle will be repeated time and again, preventing the Union from playing a positive role in history. The Union's actions, wherever it is in the world, must be guided by respect for the principles of freedom, respect for human rights, and the rights of minorities. Let us remember that we, the European Union, are a union of minorities: we are all minorities in Europe. Even among the Fifteen of us, concerns are palpable, and these may well be repeated in the coming decade. I am speaking of Austria, where the Commission has lived up to its role of working for the cohesion of the Union, but it has done so uncompromisingly and as guardian of the Treaties, ready to punish even the smallest breach of the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect for minorities.	de
"I, too, would like to move toward a linear career system, as the current system of categories no longer suits the needs of our institutions. It certainly blocks the advancement and mobility of people with proven abilities. Those of you who, during the course of this debate, have praised Commission officials, who typically and for the most part are completely upright, highly capable, and excellent workers, have made absolutely accurate comments. While the White Paper on the strategy for reform will outline our thinking on these and other issues, it is clear that detail and precision are essential. Therefore, a series of communications will appear over the coming months. Each of them will be available to this Parliament for reflection and response. In the meantime, it is clear that we will need to work closely with Parliament, as an institution, on key issues, especially pay and pensions and the review of the staff regulations. Regarding this last issue, we are considering whether it would be useful to adopt a framework regulation that would establish common provisions for the most important issues such as salaries, conditions, staff representation rights, etc., but would allow the different institutions to act by issuing regulations for other matters. Parliament's initial impressions on this idea would be particularly welcome. I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before Parliament concerning the resources needed for our policies for change. This is certainly of the utmost importance. We are confident that a significant ""reform dividend"" will emerge as the reform measures begin to bring about greater efficiency and better management of the use of resources. It is very clear, however, that some sectors of the Commission's services are already stretched to the limit. Parliament has frequently commented on this circumstance. Secondly, it is also clear that the reform will require some new investment in technological and skills training. Thirdly, it is very clear that further preparations for enlargement must be undertaken. These are already having an impact on the availability of resources. It is also clear that, if we take on new tasks—which the Council and Parliament will ask us to do—we will have to identify the so-called ""negative priorities"" and abandon them in order to create savings. A fundamental element of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous procedure for linking the priority-setting process to the allocation of resources under an activity-based management system. I would like to emphasize, however, that while the Commission will certainly introduce internal discipline in priority-setting, it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and adopt an equally strict attitude toward what is required of the Commission. The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr. van Hulten's report. I conclude, Mr. President, by thanking the House for its attention during an inevitably long intervention and by expressing my gratitude to the rapporteur, the Committee on Budgetary Control, and the other committees that gave their opinions. We look forward to continuing to work closely with this Assembly in finalizing the reform strategy package and, most importantly, to continuing to work with this Assembly on its implementation over the years, which will be necessary in complex situations of this type."	es
So from many fragments we are giving meaning to Lisbon. I believe we are giving it precisely because the Portuguese Presidency has pulled the strings of unification, putting together the different pieces of the mosaic. We now have this heritage and I hope that, in Lisbon, we will find the unity to put it into practice, because I believe we need it and we will also have unexpected fruits from it. Thank you very much, Mr President of the Commission, thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for your significant contribution to an important and interesting debate. I have received six motions for resolutions, tabled pursuant to Rule 37, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Procedure. The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon. The debate is closed. (The sitting, suspended at 8.15 p.m., resumed at 9 p.m.) Before resuming the sitting, I would like to make an observation that I usually make in night sittings, but since faces change, many of those present are not yet aware of it. I ask you to help ensure that the proceedings are carried out smoothly by adhering to the speaking time that has been granted to you. There are three reasons for this. The first is the old rule of every party: the later it gets, the more fun it is - but that does not apply to the Plenary. The second reason is that the interpreters, sitting behind the glass in the booths, also want to go to sleep. The third reason is that in addition to the interpreters, there are many other people who work behind the scenes and who have to stay until the end of the sitting, for example to ensure that the minutes are ready for tomorrow morning. So, please stick to the speaking time that has been granted to you, so that we can proceed quickly. Environmental dimension in the development process of developing countries The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0051/2000) of the Committee on Development and Cooperation on the common position adopted by the Council (12485/1/1999 - C5-0013/2000 - 1999/0020(COD)) with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on measures to promote full integration of the environmental dimension into the development process of developing countries (Rapporteur: Mr A. Wijkman). Mr President, since the Brundtland Report of 1987 we have known that a policy aimed solely at economic growth is not and cannot be sustainable in the long term. The challenge facing us all, therefore, is to integrate social sensitivity and ecological sensitivity. This implies, among other things, the impossibility of considering ecological sensitivity as a sectoral problem, and the need for any negative consequences of industrial production, transport and construction to be addressed already at the design stage, minimising their impact through measures of various kinds. The Rio Conference led to the development of an action programme in which, sector by sector, the main problems in this context are listed and solutions are proposed to ensure the protection of the environment and natural resources. Although it is a document of several hundred pages, it remains a generic programme.	it
Modernization of social protection The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000) by Mr. Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication: A concerted strategy to modernize social protection (COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)). (SV) Mr. President, social protection is an important issue. This is an obvious consequence of cooperation at Community level. The basis is monetary cooperation, which was then followed by macroeconomic cooperation and cooperation in matters related to employment policy. It is now obvious to continue with the social protection system. These sectors are interdependent. Economic stability serves as a basis for growth and can lead to an increase in employment. It also makes it possible to develop the welfare state. However, the opposite situation can also occur: a well-developed social protection policy can contribute to increasing employment and growth. Social security is, in other words, a productive factor. There are differences within the Community regarding social protection. Many of these differences have historical antecedents. However, today we face a number of common challenges. For example, demographic development, in which not only is the number of elderly people increasing but the birth rate is also declining. The labor market is also changing. Women are increasingly entering the labor market. Another challenge is technological development. We must address these challenges together. The Commission communication proposes increased exchange of experiences, the formation of a high-level group, and benchmarking. Furthermore, the social protection report is published annually and examined alongside the employment report. This is beneficial, but not enough. We propose a procedure similar to the Luxembourg Process. Clear guidelines and indicators are needed, while Member States must establish methods in their national action plans. We created a common model, but we maintained the principle of subsidiarity. Social convergence is a process that will develop over a long period of time. Therefore, Parliament must be involved in this work, not by making it part of the high-level group, but by allowing representatives of Parliament to follow the work of the high-level group and submit proposals related to the development of the process. The Commission's proposal, like cooperation on employment matters, is based on four pillars. These are: making systems employment-friendly, making the pension system sustainable in the long term, promoting social inclusion, and ensuring high-quality and sustainable healthcare. All of this is important. In our report, we particularly emphasized the importance of combating poverty at EU level and of finding indicators, as soon as possible, so that we can make progress in this area. Equal opportunities between men and women do not have a single pillar. Here, mainstreaming applies. For this reason, aspects related to equal opportunities must be found in all four pillars. This is what we have done. We propose many things, for example, moving to an individualized social protection system, maternity leave allowing parents to access social security benefits, better opportunities to coordinate family and work life, and retirement pensions ensuring decent living standards.	es
It's about harmonizing examination regulations, but actually also about minimum standards. In a sense, I regret that. Naturally, traffic safety on roads, rails, and inland waterways is extremely important, and given the international nature of these transports, it's necessary to harmonize training courses for safety advisors and the requirements, for example, in the upcoming new ADR. I consider this to be just as important as its implementation. Of course, there are good reasons why we must pay particular attention to this problem. Think of the accidents that have occurred on the roads in recent years. For example, in Belgium, the Netherlands, and other countries, vehicles transporting dangerous goods continued to drive despite the fog and were not parked at the side of the road, as would have been required under the circumstances. Or think of the skippers of Eastern European ships that anchor here alongside others and clearly pose a danger. Furthermore, inspections in Belgian, Finnish, and Japanese ports show that 50% of containers, some of which contain dangerous cargo, are not delivered properly. In short, a serious problem. Regarding safety advisors, some countries have required companies to have one since January 1 of this year. Implementation is currently fraught with difficulties, particularly in small businesses, as they cannot afford such a position. They either sell their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which leads to a host of problems. Therefore, these activities must be documented in annual reports or operational analyses, and possibly included in ISO 9002 certification. The real work has been done; now it's time for implementation. Allow me one final point. Regarding this implementation, we must also reach appropriate agreements with the Eastern European countries, as they will not accede to the relevant conventions until July 1, 2001, i.e., in a year and a half. This will give them a temporary competitive advantage. Although I don't think this is a bad thing in itself, we should give particular priority to the safety aspects of the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail, and inland waterways, incorporate this part of the acquis as soon as possible, and submit it to the applicant states. Madam President, Parliament rightly regularly addresses the issue of transport safety. The ever-increasing volume of goods transported through Europe poses an overt or covert danger to personnel and society. Those exposed to this danger must therefore meet high standards. The relevant standards enshrined in another Directive, 95/35/EC, should enable people to be advised responsibly on the transport of dangerous goods. I am pleased to note that there is also agreement with the Council on minimum requirements for their examination, although I would have preferred uniform, binding standards and regulations with the aim of ensuring internationally equivalent qualifications. However, this does not seem feasible. All in all, I consider the amendment proposed by the rapporteur to be logical in every respect and can therefore fully support it. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports, which may be technical, but are of great importance for safety.	de
Do you believe, Commissioner, that the data we have on infant mortality in Kosovo—the highest in Europe—and, in general, the image of the misfortune and human disaster in Kosovo are not already seriously damaging our credibility and calling into question our ability to carry out what we have promised? And, Commissioner, is the so-called humanitarian military intervention justified by the current image of the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo? Don't you think such inertia cannot be justified when this very right to life is at risk on the European continent itself? I do not believe that our reconstruction agency, nor the operational units before it, which have made enormous efforts in Kosovo, would consider the suggestion that their intervention has consisted of sitting idly by, as an accurate description of their work. I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that. It goes without saying that the honourable Member is right in stating that the credibility of the Union will depend on what happens, not only in Kosovo, but throughout the entire Balkan region. I am very concerned that the aid we provide arrives as quickly as possible and in a way that maximizes our assistance. I would just like to make two observations about the situation in Kosovo, which we are addressing with all the enthusiasm we can together with the WHO. First, I am sure the Honorable Member recognizes that during the 1990s, the Government in Belgrade cut funding for Kosovo's health service, and many Albanians found they were not receiving any health care. As a result, a parallel health system was created through the Mother Teresa Society. We are therefore talking not only about the consequences of the conflict, but about the consequences of years of neglect and chronic underinvestment. Second, and I am sure the Honorable Member will also recognize this, some of the tragic stories coming out of Kosovo over the past few weeks were not about infant mortality during childbirth, but about infant mortality after the birth of a healthy child. These are cases in which women have tragically killed their own children during or before hostilities. We are talking about a horrific story in Kosovo. We must make every effort in the field of health care, among others, to restore standards that approach a civilized approach and civilized behavior, but it will not be an easy task. Commissioner, I must thank you for your response to my colleague's first question and also to the supplementary question. However, my contacts in Kosovo tell me that the food parcels distributed, among others, through ECHO are often of very poor quality. In some cases, insects have even been found in the food. Are you aware of this? Are you prepared to do something to prevent it? This is my first supplementary question. My second question concerns your mention of the reconstruction of the Mitrovica hospital.	es
Retroactive legislation is perverse legislation, unfair legislation, and often unworkable legislation. Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it out of principle unless there is an overwhelming public interest, which is clearly not the case here. This is why I have requested a roll-call vote on this matter. We will be able to see who is prepared to vote in favor of retroactive legislation of dubious legality, which would represent a costly burden for future car buyers and a devastating blow to the European automotive industry. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, once again I would like to briefly recall the economic implications of this directive and renew my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague Bernd Lange. These amendments precisely have the advantage—I wish to emphasize this point—of reconciling environmental obligations with economic imperatives. The Council's common position has been that car manufacturers should bear all or a significant part of the cost of recovery and recycling. But as Mr. Lange rightly said, this solution is not at all fair to European manufacturers. Because I am from a country with many car manufacturers, I can tell you that it is not possible to impose on them, retroactively, the full financial burden of all their brand vehicles currently in use, that is, the cost burden imposed by 80% of the European car fleet. This solution is unacceptable because these manufacturers were unable to integrate the environmental requirements we impose on them today into their manufacturing processes and costs. The common position puts European manufacturers at a disadvantage compared to manufacturers new to the European market. Undoubtedly, if we are not here to defend a particular national interest, a particular industrial lobby, but rather we are here to build a competitive Europe on the global market and to defend jobs in the economic sectors in which we are truly competitive. For this reason, I ask you, the honourable Members, to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange, which will have the support of the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they effectively reconcile all the interests at hand—economic interests and environmental obligations—while leaving Member States free as to how these obligations are implemented. These amendments provide that the systems currently applied in the Member States—and there are some that work very well—should continue to operate. Mr. President, Commissioner, the proposal for a directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today seeks, on the one hand, to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the European Union and, on the other, to preserve the proper functioning of the internal market in this sector. A word about historic and vintage vehicles: they should be excluded from the scope of this directive, because, I think we will all agree on that. Automobiles are also part of our cultural heritage. That said, one of the obstacles concerns Article 12, i.e. the date of application of the directive.	es
"Over the past year, the Member States of the Union have thus, quite naturally, decided to implement concrete measures designed to strengthen the capacity for action of their armed forces, and the informal summit in Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main guidelines. I have two questions on this subject, to which your knowledge of the issues and the players involved should enable you to provide enlightening answers for the continuation of our discussions and our work. The first question concerns the formation of this rapid intervention force of 60,000 men, capable, as you have said, of being deployed to carry out peacekeeping and peacebuilding missions, and capable of maintaining them over the long term if necessary. For the benefit of our colleagues, I must point out here that the corresponding contingents must then be divided into thirds: one third to prepare for the mission, one third to carry it out, and one third to get back into shape, following often difficult trials for both personnel and equipment. This explains why the first figures given in the press, setting the volume of forces to be constituted at around 200,000 men, are close to reality, which has not failed to surprise the uninitiated. My first question will be simple and more direct, perhaps, Mr High Representative, than that of the colleagues who preceded me. You know the French proverb ""No money, no Switzerland."" Do you really think that the governments of the Union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them remain, in appearance at least, determined to continue to reap what ten years ago were called ""the dividends of peace."" My second question will be of a more technical nature, but it is important for the most harmonious possible transfer to the European Union of the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union. You have indicated to us, in this area, the establishment of three committees, a political and security committee which started today, the military committee. Then, you mentioned its relations with third countries that are members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of Western Europe, but which are not members of the European Union. In the operation of the interim institutions whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr. High Representative, what status you envisage conferring on the members of the Alliance and the States associated with the WEU, I repeat, which are not yet members of the European Union? Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, within the various political and security committees or the military committee? You know that they are worried about this risk of being isolated and I want to say that I understand their desire to participate with you in the completion of this construction. Mr President, Mr Secretary-General of the Council, as you will understand, we in this House have followed with great interest the information you have given us on the outcome of the informal meeting of Defence Ministers held in Sintra and its importance in the process of European integration in matters of security and defence."	fr
And until now, the restrictions affecting the free movement of non-EU workers within the European Union have been severe. Thus, it is positive that the movement of workers within the European Union is being facilitated, even if they are third-country nationals. However, the proposed directive aims only to allow their transfer to another Member State when they are seconded for the account of an employer established in the country of their habitual residence. Therefore, the possibility of movement is limited to the period of the secondment and only to the Member State to which they are posted. This means that this proposal is not primarily concerned with resolving the problem of the movement of these workers, but only with creating better conditions for service providers. Furthermore, the Berger report, in the name of simplifying procedures, introduces deeply questionable amendments, one example of which is the creation of a common information system for accessing cards issued by an entity in any Member State. Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger Report (A5-0012/2000). (FR) I wholeheartedly welcome the two proposals for directives designed to facilitate the free movement of workers from third countries and also the free movement of services. Essentially, these proposals introduce the EC services provision card, which will in the future allow some 5 million third-country nationals legally residing in a Member State of the European Union to provide services to other Member States, something that currently prevents problems such as obtaining visas and work permits. The first proposal for a directive will allow companies established in a Member State that employ workers who are nationals of a third country to temporarily transfer those employees to another Member State to provide services. Under the provisions envisaged, the employer will only need to apply for one services provision card for each worker. Obviously, to be eligible for this card, the worker must legally reside in a Member State and be covered by a social security scheme. The second proposal grants the same rights to independent workers who are nationals of a third country. Although I fundamentally agree with the European Commission's proposals, I recognize that some provisions could create confusion. I will therefore vote in favor of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur. This will clarify the provisions and prevent abuse. Other amendments aim to simplify administrative procedures, for example by authorizing Member States to designate a single competent authority for issuing the card. This amendment seems to me essential to avoid the administrative slowness that too often hinders the proper implementation of new provisions. I cannot but welcome the adoption of these amended directives, because it would be impossible for us to tolerate any longer the fact that people legally established in the European Union face so many difficulties.	es
Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States. It has many remote communities on the mainland that are accessible only by road, sometimes poorly connected by public transport, sometimes by none at all. These communities depend for their survival on having local facilities, such as a school, a post office, and a shop. The elderly in particular depend on the latter two. They are frequently located in the same location, each service being made more viable by the presence of the other. Scotland also has numerous island communities, some of which can be reached by air, but which mostly rely on sea ferries. It has been calculated that the actual cost of carrying a letter from Edinburgh to the central Highlands is approximately ten times that of carrying the same letter from one side of London to the other. And it is approximately four times what is actually charged for postage. The more remote the community, the greater the difference. This gives an idea of the problem. It is not opposing liberalization to ask that it be carried out in a way that takes these factors into account and allows for the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service. It is for all our remote and island communities, no matter where they are located in the European Union, and not just for the people of Scotland, that I ask you to preserve the lifeline offered by your postal services. Mr. President, I consider it a privilege to substitute for my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, on the occasion of such a high-quality debate on postal services. I will try to respond to the debate based on the information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein. I would like to reiterate that he will be available to Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on Monday. Some Members, such as Mr. Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal. Others believe that after all, a brief pause after the first step towards liberalization is not so bad. This is, for example, the position expressed by Mr. Berthu. The Commission's position is that the new proposal was delayed primarily due to internal problems within the Commission, which I am sure Parliament is not entirely unaware of. But we believe there is a legal obligation to submit a proposal. Commissioner Bolkenstein intends to submit such a proposal to the Commission for approval in the first half of this year. The planned date of 1 January 2003 for implementing the next steps remains feasible. The proposal will take into account the studies carried out and will focus in particular on aspects such as the universality of the service, to which I will return in a second. As regards the existing directive and its implementation, almost all Member States have adopted the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive. There are some problems relating to the structure of the regulatory authority and its independence. The implementation deadline for Member States is January 2003.	es
"We are working as effectively and competently as possible."" So, dear Member States, we believe that the time has now come for the Common Foreign and Security Policy to build a bridge between the Council's conclusions, between meter-long communiqués, and what we can actually achieve in this area. I believe that if we can achieve this, the role of the High Representative will be made considerably easier and the living conditions of many, many people around the world will be considerably improved. Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten! Thank you also for providing us with examples of your British humor, even on this very difficult topic. It also makes it a little more interesting. Women in the decision-making process. Next on the agenda are the statements by the Council and the Commission on women in the decision-making process. Mr President, I would like to begin my contribution by thanking the Minister and President-in-Office of the Council for participating in this debate and for her interesting remarks on the subject. I would also like to thank the Commissioner for her presence here and for the words she addressed us. In general, the various political groups agree on the evident underrepresentation of women in decision-making, both in the political and economic and social spheres. No one today disputes that women must participate in political life, in political parties and institutions, but we are finding it difficult to agree on the form in which this participation should be achieved. Equality between men and women, which most profoundly affects the lives of women and, consequently, society in general, means equality in work, both in access to employment—which presupposes equal training—and in equal pay for equal work, which has been so often called for and is still so far from reality. We are convinced that women's participation in decision-making will benefit society as a whole. Women always offer a perspective different from that of men, which enriches and perfects the overall vision of the best solutions to everyday problems, which people like us who are actively involved in politics are committed to solving. But the difficulty lies in finding the right solution that allows for a greater presence of women in positions of responsibility and thus in decision-making processes. In some European Union countries, mandatory quotas have been adopted by law, which directly achieves a more balanced representation of women. However, this may not be the best solution, because there is not always a sufficient number of women willing to enter a problematic, competitive world that they consider essentially masculine, having traditionally been the preserve of men. The proportion of women in political parties does not reach 50%, nor in the world of work and the social sphere. It is much lower, and it is precisely this grassroots participation that we should encourage to facilitate women's presence. Furthermore, there must be a clear and real will to ensure that there are more women who are able and willing to assume responsibility and duties in political life, that is, in the decision-making process."	de
In truth, a hierarchy of oppression has been created. Until all individuals are recognised as equal before the law, this inequality will cause discrimination and human rights will be eroded. In the process of enlargement of the Union, we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities. We must not abandon this commitment. But we must also look in the mirror and recognise our inadequacies. Yes, the conventions have been signed, but action is needed. I would like to propose continuous checks on the observance of human rights, eternal vigilance, not only outside our borders, but also within. That is why I am in favour of each Member State submitting an annual report, listing any accusations made against it and the measures taken. Because what happens in each Member State happens to each of us. What happens in another part of the world concerns us all. Pinochet in Chile is as important as Haider in Austria. Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked. Human rights are not isolated, they are linked to our development policies, our economic policies, our home affairs policies, in fact they are at the heart of our democratic functions. I would like to reiterate what Commissioner Patten said: we must engage, we must inform, we must educate and in this way bring about real and lasting change. Mr President, 'Europe is about ideals, values and principles. We must give space to the spiritual history of Europe. We must jointly restore the values that unite Europe. Spiritual values have spread from Europe to the rest of the world. We must live with our consciences'. That is what the President of the Czech Republic, Václav Havel, said in this Chamber three hours ago. In a particularly edifying speech, filled with insight into the human soul, wisdom, knowledge of history and insight into Europe's spiritual and Christian heritage, he was able to point to the sources of inspiration for our work on human dignity and human rights. We should be grateful that in our Europe there are heads of state like Václav Havel. I would like to focus on two aspects. First, civil society. Havel recalled that in Eastern Europe, communist regimes systematically destroyed civil society: popular movements, churches, independent trade unions. This is also what is happening in China with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches. This is what is happening with Lamaism in Tibet. We must never forget the defense of civil society. I would also like to talk about the death penalty. The European Union, just like Sweden where I come from, has built its vision of the human being on the basis of equality, uniqueness and the inviolability of human dignity. According to this principle, the human being must always have the possibility of reform. Tell that to the government of the United States, to the government of Russia and to the government of China! Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe that the line that the Member States of the European Union should follow in Geneva is to give priority to the situations in Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and China.	it
"Mr President, this cannot continue; something must be done about this situation. Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam set out an important objective for the Union, a task that all parliamentarians, the Council, and the Commission must assume during this parliamentary term: the creation, as I have already said, of an area of freedom, security, and justice. The Tampere Council, the driving force and originator of this objective, proposed certain objectives, but the five-year period envisaged for the implementation of Title IV of the Treaty is too long to wait for the urgent solutions that certain problems require. My first consideration is that Parliament cannot be sidelined when the important decisions are taken in this area, and its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed, particularly when it concerns a citizens' project, as the Commissioner rightly said. My second consideration is the need to make rapid progress in adopting a common asylum system, adopting common procedural standards and, above all, putting an end to the current confusion between immigration for political and economic reasons. The aliens laws recently adopted in my country, Spain, and in Belgium remind us of the urgent need to communitize immigration policy. My third and final reflection relates to the Union's external policy on immigration and asylum. We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union is solely concerned with defending itself against an avalanche of refugees and economic immigrants. We must advocate a policy of development cooperation with our eastern and Mediterranean neighbors, but we must do so conscientiously, using economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions that work together to protect citizens who see their most fundamental rights violated or who wish to emigrate because their most basic needs are at stake. Finally, with regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, European citizens must make their citizenship known. It is not enough to have the euro or employment, nor even security. They need the ""European soul,"" as a distinguished Spanish professor has said. Mr. President, contrary to some previous speakers, I would like to reiterate the words of our Portuguese ministers and the remarks of Mr. Vitorino. As Mr. Ceyhun said, these gentlemen's statements were music to our ears. Just as in music, fine-tuning and coordination are necessary. Many of us are very optimistic about the six months ahead. The citizens of Europe will be listening to our tune, and they will want to hear the right tune. As mentioned this afternoon, it will take some time before we can resolve the discordant notes we heard during the European elections and over the past few months. The Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere Council continued the project of creating an area of freedom, security, and justice within the European Union. However, one area is of enormous importance, and in this area Parliament must be involved: scrutiny."	de
Finally, we need to go further in development aid policies in the least developed countries. In budgetary and financial matters, regarding debt, aid to sensitive sectors such as food and humanitarian security or education and health, in the field of the environment, investment or access to information and new technologies, as well as in the trade sector, while at the same time ensuring overall coherence of development policies with other Community policies and also between them and the related policies pursued by the Member States. We cannot be content to give continuity to what, in the past, has proven insufficient and wrong. Mr President, today, after listening to the Council and the Commission, I had to look at my agenda. It actually says 'Coherence of the various Union policies with development policy'. But we have not heard a single word about it, and I think that is extremely embarrassing. We have been waiting for years for a report on coherence. It should have been tabled in writing today, and after hearing Commissioner Nielson's speech, I can easily imagine that it will meet with strong opposition within the Commission. I know that the Commissioner himself has strong and very rational views on the issue of coherence, and I would have liked to hear them today. Since the joint motion for a resolution suggests a number of effective mechanisms to ensure coherence, I would like to mention just one more in the short time I have, namely that the Commission should also start evaluating new and relevant legislation in this area. I would also like to focus on the catastrophic effect that the common agricultural policy has on developing countries. Beef is dumped in the Sahel countries and South Africa, tomato paste in West Africa, milk powder in Jamaica - the examples are, we hope, all well known. And in any case they are only too well known to the affected producers in the ACP countries who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with products subsidised by the European Union. European taxpayers pay €40 billion a year to support EU agriculture. This money helps to slow down the development of the agricultural sector in developing countries, where 69% of the total workforce is concentrated in agriculture, compared to 1.7% in the European Union. Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector contributes 34% of the gross national product of developing countries, compared to 5.3% for the European Union. There is neither coherence nor decency. Why do neither the Council nor the Commission want to admit this? Mr President, the way in which political decisions are reached is undoubtedly crucial. Yesterday, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Foreign Secretary made statements on the British Government's policy on the voting system in the Council. They noted that the United Kingdom, France and Germany currently far outnumber the other countries of the European Union in terms of population.	it
The first aspect concerns the fight against poverty, which I believe is starting to become a very embarrassing story for the Union and the Member States. Although we have made a commitment in the Treaty and at the UN conferences in Rio and Copenhagen to eradicate poverty worldwide, in reality the budget for development cooperation is being cut, contrary to the declared intentions. This is a trend that must be stopped. First of all, we must proceed with debt cancellation. We must move from words to deeds. I hope that we will be able to take a leading role in this task. The second aspect concerns the fact that, in many situations, we say that the ACP countries must learn the fundamentals of democracy. In paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution, it is called for working methods to be developed and optimised within the framework of the new Convention, and for the ACP countries to be encouraged to contribute to the debate with a plurality of political opinions. That is fine, I can only endorse it. At the same time, however, we must ask ourselves how we ourselves manage democracy. How do things work in the European Parliament's delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Assembly? In contrast to the way things work in Parliament and its committees, where rapporteurs are ultimately designated and then appointed, in the delegation to the Joint Assembly there are no rules. The two large groups share out all the reports, general reports, etc. It is precisely to change this undemocratic way of functioning that the Verts/ALE Group has tabled Amendment No 6. In this amendment, we call for the appointment of rapporteurs for all reports, including working groups and general reports, to be carried out in accordance with clear and democratic rules. In this respect, account must be taken of the small groups and the aspect of representativeness. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the quality of his report, which accurately reflects the tenor of the discussions in the Joint Assembly, of which he has co-chaired very effectively. The eradication of poverty was at the heart of our work and, to achieve this ambitious objective, many of those who spoke had drawn attention to the need to preserve an essential instrument, namely the preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries, within the framework of the Lomé Conventions. The challenge was formidable. Globalisation, the liberalisation of trade, as well as the pre-eminence of the WTO and the globalist philosophy for which it is the vehicle, were jeopardising the very essence of the dialogue between North and South. We can therefore only welcome the conclusion of the new Development Partnership Agreement and, for my part, I am convinced that the work of the last Joint Assembly has had a decisive influence on unblocking the negotiations, as has the new climate created by the events in Seattle. However, while I am pleased with the renewal of the agreements, what attracts my attention above all is the new wind that is now blowing in our relations and which is evident in the balanced nature of the negotiations now coming to a close.	it
Oil hits the beaches, and then politicians and ministers show up and take care of the disposal themselves, even with a small bucket. But when a tough directive is up for debate two weeks later, yesterday's good words have been forgotten. We won't be able to rule out accidents 100%, but we can make precautions as optimal as possible. This consistent directive is an important step towards that. I also hope that my liberal colleagues will perhaps consider by tomorrow whether they can participate again in the second reading—also for reasons of parliamentary identity—as they did in the first reading. Because we will then go into the conciliation procedure anyway, and we will have to see how far the Council can go. I believe that, for environmental and competitive reasons, as well as in light of what was decided two months ago, in January, we should adopt these proposals tomorrow with a broad majority, as we debated them in committee. Mr. President, Commissioner, Mr. Rapporteur, congratulations on your report. You just said it: this directive is urgently needed. It is a sensible directive. Ports need reception facilities. Inspections are finally being carried out. Member States must also impose sanctions for non-compliance with the rules. This is extremely important and serves environmental protection. Investments are already being made in anticipation of the directive. In Antwerp, for example, a large facility is currently being built not far from where I live, which was previously missing. In a sense, therefore, this directive is already effective. We disagree on one point, which Mr. Jarzembowski also raised. How do you charge the disposal costs to the ship? We agree on the principle, namely the polluter pays principle. However, should the polluter automatically pay the port dues in full or make a significant contribution, or should we opt for a flexible arrangement, as now proposed by the Council? Which solution offers the most effective economic incentive, as you have said? I have spoken to several people about this. Viewpoints differ, and apparently the approach in practice is quite different. Even between ports within the same region, there are differences, and different percentages apply. Some ports change their percentages literally at the last minute. It would therefore probably be best for us as a Parliament not to commit to a specific percentage. A flexible system under these circumstances must, as you said, involve a substantial contribution to the costs. 0.01% is certainly not a substantial contribution. With a flexible element left open, incentives must be offered to those who behave in an environmentally friendly manner. The prerequisite is that the Commission carefully monitors the whole thing and checks whether the system is working. If the directive's objectives are not met, you should intervene with the Commission, take steps, propose changes, and ensure that the system is actually working. We must save this directive at all costs, maintain it, and get it through. Let us hope that we do not jeopardize it by taking an overly fundamental stance on one particular point. Mr. President, not so long ago, it was widely believed that waste was completely disposed of when it was dumped at sea or incinerated.	de
Particularly in recent months, there has been discussion about the role that the Development Council can play in the field of Union policy. As is well known, there is a clear difference between development policy and other policy areas at Union level – one need only think of the difficult conditions under which the inclusion or exclusion of the EDF in the budget was decided – and it is difficult to imagine that we can achieve greater coherence in European Union policies without a more active and more involved role for the Development Council in advising on political decisions that are primarily development-related and are taken in other councils, in other decision-making centres – whether the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils or the Environment Councils – but in which the Development Council has so far had no opportunity to be heard or to intervene. Consequently, without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decisions that directly affect the European Union's development policy and are taken at the periphery of its decision-making centre, it will certainly be difficult to achieve a more coherent European Union policy in the field of development objectives. Here, too, the European Parliament's input and reflections will be relevant and welcome. I would like to begin by highlighting the successful conclusion of the negotiations between the EU and the ACP states. Participating in these negotiations was an extremely positive experience. I saw how the Member States worked together as a team, and that was very gratifying. In the end, both sides were very satisfied, not only because the negotiations were concluded, but because we all realized that together, the EU and the 71 ACP states, we had achieved something. The world needs such experiences, and this is a very positive signal with regard to the discussion on the issue of globalization. I would like to outline some of the most important innovations in the new agreement. Corruption is openly addressed, and for the first time, we are creating a framework within which the problem of immigration can be addressed. We are promoting participatory approaches and ensuring consultation with civil society on the reforms and policies that the EU intends to promote. We are placing greater emphasis on poverty reduction at the heart of our development policy. The allocation of resources is based not only on an assessment of a country's needs, but also on its policies. To promote private sector development, we are establishing an investment facility. We are rationalizing instruments and introducing a new system of dynamic programming so that the Community and recipient countries can regularly make adjustments to cooperation programs. We are decentralizing administrative and, in some cases, financial responsibilities to the local level to enable more effective cooperation. We are improving the policy framework for trade and investment development. We are expanding cooperation in all areas important for trade, including new areas such as labor standards and the link between the environment and trade. I am sure that, in light of the events in Seattle, you will welcome the importance of these agreements. Let me highlight some of the key points. First, the agreement on political issues.	de
This is the meaning of an amendment that we have tabled, which gives priority to all the languages of the Community and which will condition our agreement on the second directive. The situation is quite different with the first proposal. The original text could have received our assent insofar as it stemmed from a legitimate concern to update existing legislation. The text of the report - and I commend the work of our colleague Schmidt - however, cannot receive our approval for several reasons. Firstly, it favours far too many products based on indices that no longer have any connection with the real economy, derivative products that will contribute to increasing the financial bubble that our colleague Lipietz spoke about just now. Secondly, like him, I believe that we should not favour excessive concentration in funds that would ultimately prove to be a Trojan horse for American pension funds. So, obviously, no reciprocity is planned in favour of European UCITS. We will also oppose the removal of the power given to Member States to increase to 35%... (The President cut off the speaker) Mr President, this is a vital issue for Europe. A Europe that is living with a time bomb ready to explode at any moment, namely pensions, must take all measures to encourage savings and maximize the returns that European citizens can obtain from their savings. I welcome Mr Schmidt's report, which contains many interesting developments. UCITS are a success story in the European Union. They are safe products marketed cross-border. However, it is time to update the legislation. Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job in this regard. I will not surprise anyone by saying that I would have much preferred that Mr Schmidt's report had not undergone so many changes during its passage through Parliament. But I urge this House to take a balanced and wholesome approach to this issue. The radical step forward in this report is to allow UCITS to invest in over-the-counter derivatives. I challenge anyone here to assess the products that will be used by UCITS. We are not talking about speculation, but about reducing the risks and increasing the returns on investments made by ordinary European citizens. Mr Schmidt deserves applause for receiving the support of Parliament on the issue of over-the-counter derivatives. We must not be afraid to move forward, to react to changes in the market. Yes, we must continue to ensure that UCITS remain a balanced and safe product for consumers. The report provides entirely adequate protection for consumers. But a series of amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives. I have the feeling that they will be an interesting addition to SICAV portfolios, and that they can only help everyone, everywhere in Europe, to achieve a high return on their savings. I greet Mr. Schmidt. Thank you, Mr. Kuckelkorn. Dear colleagues, I would like to share with you the information I have just received about the curtain and the window.	fr
"Both countries are also eligible for financial assistance from the MEDA program (B7-4012). In its first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament emphasized that the new title ""Pre-accession Strategy for the Countries of Central and Eastern Europe"" (B7-0), proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget, should not only refer to the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe, but should also be extended to other third countries such as Malta and Cyprus. However, since the Council refused to negotiate the necessary revision of the ceiling in heading 7 (pre-accession) of the financial perspective, Parliament exceptionally accepted—I emphasize this explicitly—the financing of this expenditure under heading 4 (external actions) of the financial perspective in 2000. At the same time, the European Parliament created a new chapter, ""Cooperation with Mediterranean third countries"" (B7-04). Within this chapter, two new articles on the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus have been created and marked ""pm"" until the Commission, in implementation of the Helsinki decisions, provides the necessary legal bases and the ceiling for heading 7 of the financial perspective has been revised. This proposal for a regulation should be one of these legal bases! I welcome Mr Brok's report, which supports, with amendments, the Commission's proposals for preparing Cyprus and Malta for EU membership. Under this package, a total of approximately EUR 15 million will be granted to the two countries this year. However, it is regrettable that the Commission has bypassed multiannual funding and instead decided to allocate funds on an annual basis. This is bound to have an impact on Malta's and Cyprus's ability to plan their expenditure. The appropriation will provide technical and financial assistance to enable the two islands to make the necessary adoption of the Community acquis. Given the advanced status of these two countries compared to other candidate countries, it should not be difficult for them to be technically and administratively ready for membership at the end of the five-year programme. Cederschiöld Report (A5-0020/2000) As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the previous parliamentary term, I welcome the adoption of this framework decision on strengthening the protection of our single currency. The Union must use all the means at its disposal to ensure effective protection of the euro against counterfeiting. Consumers and businesspeople are not yet truly familiar with the euro. Counterfeit money can therefore be circulated relatively easily in supermarkets, exchange bureaus, and banks without being immediately noticed. The fact that the coins will have a national side will make their identification even more difficult. The Euro Information Centres, which already play a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency, must intensify their campaign to raise public awareness of the risks of counterfeiting. At another level, cooperation between Community and national institutions must be ensured and an information system for collecting and exchanging data on counterfeiting must be established. Likewise, criminal law measures must be taken to ensure the protection of the euro from the very beginning. In this context, the European Parliament has presented a draft framework decision on strengthening criminal protection against counterfeiting."	de
Hence, complementary measures are required, such as the obligation for criminal investigation officers to testify, whenever desired, in any criminal trial in which their material is used. My group also cannot accept that the Council's proposal breaches the principle of proportionality. It is clear that the scope of application is not subject to restrictions. The Convention does not only apply to the fight against serious crime and organized crime. It does not even appear anywhere that it is limited to criminal law. Therefore, it is not inconceivable that the European Union will end up killing mosquitoes with cannonballs and that citizens' rights will vanish in the smoke of gunpowder. Mr. President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters that we are examining today contains the bare minimum necessary for rapid and effective cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies. It deals with notifications, the exchange of information, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of property, statements by videoconference, investigative activities and undercover calls, wiretapping, etc. This is the minimum on which an agreement could be reached, and it goes without saying that if some amendments are accepted, such as Amendments 32 or 81, the revised Amendment 70 or 71, the entire Convention will be reduced to the mere exchange of notifications or information and, in fact, should be thrown into the wastebasket, and we would vote against it. I hope that the common sense of the Members of the various groups will lead them to reject these amendments. Furthermore, the fact that it has not been transformed into a framework agreement and has remained within the scope of conventions is a defeat for Parliament. As Commissioner Vitorino will have seen from the various interventions, there is a growing need to develop a framework of common rules, that is, to stop moving forward in this way, with this scattered order, with these small agreements covering different sectors such as investigations and others. On the contrary, a minimum of secure rules, valid within the Community, with an obvious increase in guarantees to the highest levels, is absolutely necessary, precisely to protect ourselves in view of enlargement. I think about what this Community, these agreements, or judicial relations would become if, for example, a fascist country like Turkey were to join the European Union: I would be truly perplexed. It is necessary to establish a corpus juris—everyone has said so—and common rules, especially procedural ones, that guarantee a common rule of law throughout the Community. It is obvious that this is a matter for the Intergovernmental Conference and that it is an aspiration to which Parliament can contribute in a limited way, since everything depends on the Council and the Commission. I believe that this first semester, in which the Commissioner is Portuguese and the Presidency is held by Portugal, is an excellent opportunity to give an initial push to this common aspiration.	es
I also ask that the Commission, within the framework of the projects that have been presented, ensure that the environmental pillar of European Union policy is included in its projects and that, indeed, the objective of reducing CO2 emissions, for example, can be a pilot added value for projects that have been proposed. I am thinking particularly here of some of the infrastructure projects under construction. We know that some Member States are hesitating between rail and road crossings in fragile areas like the Pyrenees—I am thinking of the Aspe Valley. But I am also thinking of my region, where my Member State is still hesitating between building a rail crossing and proposing a second motorway, the A32. Therefore, here too, I will ask the Commission to be particularly vigilant to ensure genuine cohesion between the various policies, and especially in the Interreg programs that are being presented. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the Decourrière report on the Community initiative INTERREG, not least because of the response Commissioner Barnier gave to certain Members who spoke and asked that this program should, if possible, pay even more attention to border regions whose boundaries are marked by the sea. This is not only because I was born in Genoa, a city on the seashore, but above all because the borders of the regions bordered by the sea are also borders. These borders lead us to the States of Africa and the Middle East: we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions everywhere in Europe. (FR) As a Member of the European Parliament from a border region, I welcome this third Interreg initiative with great interest. The difficulties encountered in the past by border regions, both land and sea, which have been economically, socially, and culturally isolated, cannot be sufficiently recalled. Due to the presence of borders, these regions have become peripheral areas of the states of which they are part, which has all too often led national authorities, within the framework of national policy, to neglect these regions. For this reason, the Community initiative Interreg was established in 1990. The objective of this program was to stimulate cross-border, transnational, and interregional cooperation, as well as a balanced development of the Community area, in order to strengthen economic and social cohesion within the Union. Interreg essentially aims to finance joint actions in the areas of SME development, training and education, cultural exchanges, health issues, environmental protection and improvement, energy networks, transport, and telecommunications. I emphasize the fact that interregional cooperation helps to associate local and regional authorities with the process of European integration. It is necessary to promote more active participation of local and regional authorities in Community initiatives, taking into account the fact that local and regional authorities often have very limited capacities for cooperation due to the diversity of legal frameworks and the disparity in levels of development on both sides of the border. Within the framework of cross-border cooperation, increasing importance must be given to improving the operating conditions of small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs. Similarly, and given that 50% of unemployment is attributable to structural unemployment, the resources made available through Interreg must be sufficiently significant to complement national measures aimed at promoting employment.	es
In the light of these facts, does the Council intend to call into question the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as requested by the European Parliament? What other practical measures does the Council intend to take to put an end to ethnic cleansing? Honourable Member, I would like to say that I have the greatest sympathy for the concern inherent in the issue you have raised. We truly share your concerns about the threatening situation within Kosovo for ethnic minorities, both Serb and Roma, and about the cases of discrimination, siege and intimidation that continue to occur in that territory. The Council has always stressed the need to bring to justice all those who have perpetrated and continue to perpetrate such acts. It also reiterated, in its December conclusions, the need to fully implement Security Council Resolution 12/99 and consistently supported the efforts of Bernard Kouchner to implement measures to ensure effective protection of minorities in that territory and, in particular, effective implementation of measures to preserve the multi-ethnicity of the territory itself. In our contacts with leading political figures among the Albanians of Kosovo, we have stressed - as the Portuguese Prime Minister recently did - that the persecution of the Serb, Gypsy and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable. It will not be tolerated and must stop immediately. It has been communicated and explicitly reiterated to the leaders of Kosovo that international support will depend largely on the treatment of non-Albanian minorities. This seems to me to be of the utmost importance; the European Union will maintain the sense of conditionality inherent in this position and the same goes for the Council. We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security force in Kosovo to prevent new outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect threatened populations. KFOR and the UNMIK police consider one of their primary tasks to be the suppression of all forms of ill-treatment based on ethnic origin. In this context, the Council welcomed in its December conclusions the substantial contributions announced by the European Commission which, together with others of a similar nature offered by Member States, will contribute indirectly to the normalisation of the situation. However, Honourable Member, the Council is also aware that the overall means made available to the international structures responsible in Kosovo do not correspond, in terms of mobilisation of the various Member States, to what would be desirable and this has limited the structures' effective capacity to intervene on the ground. However, we will not stop focusing all our attention on this problem, because the entire credibility of the Albanian authorities and representative structures on the territory also depends on the ability of these same structures to prove that they are capable of applying measures that guarantee multi-ethnicity within the said territory. Thank you, Mr. President-in-Office of the Council.	it
"We have a duty to protect this kind of thing and denounce other practices. Mr President, Commissioner, I heard this morning on the French national radio that the liberalization of the Post Office would practically only be a matter of hours or days and that it was irremediable, as happened with our Swedish, Dutch and German friends. This worries us greatly and is the reason why we requested this debate today. The Commission has, in fact, committed to a universal postal service, and the European Parliament has shown on several occasions that the postal service is indeed, as some colleagues have already said, an essential factor in social and territorial cohesion. In this regard, I would perhaps like to address our Swedish colleague to ask him what he thinks of the study that was carried out and which shows that, in fact, in more remote areas of Sweden, the postal service is rather poor, in terms of delivery. So we don't want this postal service. The economic interest of the postal service was recognized by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and we believe that it goes well beyond delivery. It is the service that remains closest to citizens and that we call ""public service,"" which allows every inhabitant of European territory to be served, and this achievement must remain a Community achievement. The recognition by the European Union of a high-quality postal service, for everyone, remains relevant today, and we are increasingly concerned. This is why we are asking today not to have any unpleasant surprises on Monday in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. We recall that Parliament's positions were clearly defined and that the Green group supported them. This resolution of January 14, 1999, requested that before any further liberalization of this key sector, which still affects 1.7 million employees, the Commission provide impact studies of this liberalization. However, we are not convinced that the studies available today can implement this liberalisation, and we are worried because we know very well that this liberalisation without an impact study would lead to thousands of job losses, which we absolutely do not want. We are committed to our public service, to our universal postal service, because we know, and we are the representatives of the citizens here too, that citizens are committed to this service and the Commission committed itself, during Mr Bolkestein's hearing, to preserving this universal service in the European Union. I will not repeat the various comments he made during his hearing; I believe we all still remember them. We also maintain that we are waiting for this genuine assessment before any final decision, as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive. We will not accept a date for the liberalisation of all postal activities until the Commission has given us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the States which consider this service essential to the citizen."	fr
Parliament has always viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment opportunities. These amendments are consistent with Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious problem requiring constructive action. We hope that those considering rejecting these amendments will be able to provide both Parliament and their job-seeking citizens with sound reasons for their decision. Mrs. Flautre's report also highlighted an area where coordination is severely lacking, even though it is precisely here that considerable coordination is needed. The Commission's proposals relate to the four pillars of the employment strategy and the five areas of action of the European Social Fund. However, the lack of concrete guidelines is all the more regrettable given that the idea of linking ESF interventions with the employment strategy is being implemented for the first time in the 2000-2006 programming period. This omission certainly gives the impression that the Commission, too, is unaware of how to ensure the fullest possible coordination between ESF assistance, which is subject to review after three and a half years, and the Member States' annual National Action Plans for Employment. We hope that the Commission can convince us that this is merely an oversight that will be corrected without delay. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development considers the proposal submitted by the Commission in fulfillment of its mandate to be a sensible starting point. However, I would like to stress that this starting point highlights the challenges we face: how to maintain the population in rural areas in the face of changes in all types of economic activities resulting from the declining importance of the agricultural sector among the various sources of income for rural society. This, combined with deficiencies in infrastructure and services and a generally very scarce, highly seasonal, and poorly diversified range of jobs, is increasing the rate of migration from rural areas. The consequences are immediate. Young people are migrating, those who find training and employment outside rural areas, which has a very negative impact on these regions. This lack of infrastructure, in turn, is an obstacle to the establishment of businesses and the creation of jobs. It is important to remember that rural areas account for almost four-fifths of the European Union's territory. Agriculture provides only 5.5% of the Union's jobs. Furthermore, three-quarters of our farmers are part-time farmers and rely on additional sources of income. For this reason, one of the most important and far-reaching objectives that we in the European Union should set ourselves is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas outside the agricultural sector, including in rural tourism, sport, culture, resource rehabilitation, business conversion, new technologies, services, etc. However, although agriculture no longer plays an exclusive role, it remains important, not only to prevent the economic and social decline of rural areas and the creation of more ghost towns, but also because farmers have a fundamental role to play in managing the territory, preserving biodiversity and protecting the environment. We therefore advocate an agricultural policy and rural development that is consistent with our objectives and that, as we enter the 21st century, rural areas must be competitive and multifunctional, both in terms of agriculture and in terms of opening up to a variety of non-agricultural activities.	de
The problem concerns Danes, or citizens of other States, residing outside the territory of Denmark. Question No 37, by the Honourable Member (H-0791/99): Subject: Working Time Directive Can the Commission say what measures it intends to take to ensure a level of protection, equivalent to that provided by the 1993 Working Time Directive, for hospital doctors in training who are excluded from that Directive and from the Council's proposal for amendment thereto (COM(98)0662-C4-0715/98-98/0318(SYN))? There is a proposal for a directive to amend the Directive as regards the working time of hospital doctors in training. The content of the proposal concerns the weekly working time of doctors, which is on average 48 hours, with the possibility of negotiating an extension to 54 hours. In this regard, there is agreement between the Council, the Commission and the Parliament on the content, while there is disagreement between the three institutions regarding the transition period needed to implement the directive. The Parliament's proposal envisages a period of 4 years, the Commission's proposal of 7 years and, finally, the Council's proposal advocates a transition period of 13 years. This proposal is still being discussed between the Council and Parliament under the codecision procedure. Despite this disagreement, it should be stressed that there is agreement between the three institutions on the content and that every effort is being made to ensure that such an important and sensitive issue, which involves an exceptionally large number of doctors working throughout Europe, can receive a common solution. Question No 38, by the Honourable Member (H-0805/99): Subject: Measures to achieve equality between men and women One of the groups of Commissioners communicated by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to achieve equality between men and women (mainstreaming). Which Commissioners form the group? How many times has it met so far? What concrete measures have been discussed? The question concerns separate issues. It concerns the specific committee set up by the Commission on equal opportunities. The Commissioners who are members of this committee are President Prodi, Vice-President Kinnock, Commissioner Reading and myself. The sessions of this committee are public and the first of these took place on 11 January 2000. Three important subjects were addressed: the first discussion held on the fifth programme for women, in which I had the opportunity to present an initial analysis of it; Commissioner Busquin's report on research and women's participation in research and science; and finally Commissioner Kinnock's statement informing the Commission of the commitment to ensuring that the gender dimension is taken into account in the general reform process now under way within the Community. Thank you for your reply, Commissioner. I must, however, regret the fact that this working group took so long to meet, despite the great importance of the issue having led us to trust that the new Commission, from the outset, would work in every area useful for achieving greater equality between men and women. I hope that in the future the situation may change and that the meetings of this working group will be more frequent, because there are so many issues that require the Commission's intervention, so as to facilitate and speed up the implementation, in the shortest possible time, of measures that guarantee greater equality between the two sexes.	it
Following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission, great expectations have been generated. Sometimes I get the impression that proposals are more well-received in this Parliament the more radical they sound. On the other hand, the situation is not resolved overnight with a clean slate, and the difficulties begin as soon as the time comes to implement the measures, as soon as the details have to be discussed. This is possibly the explanation why we in the Committee on Budgetary Control had more difficulties than expected with this matter. Despite this, the results can now be seen, and I would like to expressly thank Mr. van Hulten for his work on this report. If this report loses its consistency again through the acceptance of amendments, we are giving the Commission a clear and obvious advantage on several crucial points. Let me tell you the main advantages. We do not want financial controls to be abolished. It must remain possible for the auditor to examine resource allocations and payments before they are actually made, although not in every case, but only when there is some uncertainty or risk. This is why the Commission sends out the wrong signals, for example, when it changes the name of the Directorate-General for Financial Control to Directorate-General for Audit. Changing the Commission's organizational chart is easy, but it will be more complicated when the Commission turns to the texts, particularly the budgetary regulation. I haven't counted it exactly, but the Community's budgetary procedure and its implementing provisions refer in almost 100 different places to the financial controller, its independence, and the tasks assigned to it. This cannot be ignored or circumvented, not even with so-called soft law, as was once heard at a meeting of our committee. Regardless of such legal considerations, it would be an unforgivable mistake, given the nature of the matter, to abolish financial oversight in the traditional sense at the very moment when the Commission's competent authorities in this area are no longer alone, but are integrated into a chain of operational oversight and investigation mechanisms. According to our forecasts, three mechanisms will eventually influence each other in the future: the prior independent oversight of the financial controller; the accompanying and complementary oversight of the audit service, still being established, also known as the Audit Service; and, finally, the oversight of the new anti-fraud office, OLAF, which will look for any signs of irregularities. It is positive that Mr. van Hulten's report establishes the connection between the three areas and highlights the main shortcomings that need to be addressed. I will simply state that disciplinary procedures are insufficient, particularly when it comes to holding officials accountable for misconduct, including in financial matters. There is a large gray area and many unclear points when it comes to imposing criminal sanctions, and in this regard, the Commission's announcements are rather vague.	es
If such rules exist, who is responsible for ensuring their compliance, and what are they doing to fulfill that responsibility? Mr. President, I would like to raise again the issue of the status of assistants to Members, which we have always considered a priority, and to inform you that, as Italian members of the Group and responding to the invitation of the Group Chairman, Mr. Barón Crespo, we have sent the Quaestors the contracts we have with our assistants. I believe this is a concrete gesture to try to resolve this matter. Consequently, I would like to suggest to the Presidency of Parliament that it reflect on the appropriateness of the Presidency itself asking all Members to do the same. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I am completely in favor of a status for assistants. Yesterday, when I arrived at Parliament, I was given a document regarding a demonstration that had been called by the assistants outside the Parliamentary building. As all colleagues will know—and many of you have contacted me for this reason over the past six months—all demonstrations and events of this nature are first filtered through Parliament's Comart Committee. As a non-controversial example, no trade exhibitions are permitted here in Parliament for obvious reasons. Following the letter I received yesterday, I immediately informed those present that we would propose authorizing a meeting or demonstration, probably in the near future and possibly next month. But all demonstrations must be carried out in a way that does not interfere with the smooth running of Parliament's business. Yesterday afternoon, I signed a letter at the Parliament's Bureau meeting informing those present about this. But as far as I have also been able to gather, they were verbally informed of this decision by the Committee of Group Chairs last Thursday, so they were aware of it. We have nothing against those present telling us how they feel, nor do we have anything against them gathering during Parliament's next part-session. But there was a misunderstanding, since they received a letter from someone else that led them to believe they had authorization. But all demonstrations are first reviewed by the so-called Comart Committee. As you can see, we attend many demonstrations around Parliament, relating to different countries or for other reasons. This is not an attempt at censorship or to go against the genuine and justified principle that we should have a statute for those attending. Thank you very much, Mrs. Banotti. I think your intervention can clarify many of the issues raised. Mr. President, I wanted to point out an important point of principle. Personally, I find it scandalous that some Members of this Parliament criticize the demonstrations instead of seeking a solution to the problem, which involves fair conditions, fair salaries, and fair working hours.	es
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having taken note of the Commission communication on the INTERREG III Community initiative, and having recalled that I took part in the vote on Mr Decourrière's report within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I feel it is important not only to reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative in its current form but also, particularly in the context of INTERREG III B, to urge the Commission to recognise activities which are leading to the renewal of landscapes damaged by agricultural prices and in which numerous associations, particularly hunting associations, are making a major contribution in my country. I would also like to expressly support the comments made by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, particularly with regard to the disappointment at the exclusion of the outermost regions from Strand A of the programme, the regret at the vague selection criteria for the implementation arrangements for Strand III C, and finally, the question of the participation of Members of Parliament in the work of the Observatory for Cross-Border, Transregional and Interregional Cooperation. I also have serious reservations about the tendency in the Commission's communication on INTERREG III and III B to attribute environmental protection exclusively to the development of Natura 2000. This often seems to me to be an overly abstract means of protecting ecosystems, whose users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted. Finally, I would like to stress, and appeal in advance for the understanding of the Commission and the Council of Ministers concerned, that it would be advisable to provide European representatives with better information about the procedures involved in implementing INTERREG dossiers and, moreover, about similar initiatives. It would be even better to involve them more closely in the drafting and implementation of the programs in question, as otherwise they find it difficult to play their role vis-à-vis local authorities, national authorities, and even citizens. Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for the EQUAL report, Ms Stenzel, most sincerely for her efforts to make this difficult subject understandable to us all. EQUAL is an extremely complicated program because it attempts to merge various old programs while adopting a new approach, and to do so with fewer resources than were available for the previous funds. That is not so easy. However, the number of people reached by these programs has not really decreased. That is why it is difficult to strike a balance, not only between the individual countries and the individual sub-sectors, but especially between the target groups listed in the program. And that is essentially what we have been struggling with up to now. Some have said that one group should get more than another. I have personally focused primarily on the position of disabled and elderly people in the program, who, I believe, might have been occasionally overlooked if the European Parliament hadn't paid close attention to them. Although other groups are listed, the Member States, in particular, are on the lookout. One Member State I know, for example, wants to allocate a significant portion of the entire program to a single area: refugees.	de
This project has been long and complex. It will also be important to actively promote research into the use of renewable energy sources in the future. Although the new directive is valid, some shortcomings must also be highlighted, such as the use of peat, which must not be considered a fossil fuel. However, if it is not possible to classify it as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, a new ad hoc category must be created, taking into account the environmental tax in particular. It is not right that peat should be assessed using the same parameters as, for example, hard coal. The development of renewable energy sources is one of the tools that would allow the Union to reduce its dependence on imported energy sources. Research plays a key role, especially in view of the next round of negotiations for the enlargement of the EU. Dependence on imported energy sources affects some Eastern European countries most, which are still heavily dependent on the model introduced during the Soviet era. The European Union must be able to respect the Kyoto Agreements. It is clear that we are all concerned about the environment and the future of our children: that is why we must promote the rational use of renewable energy sources. However, we must remember that we cannot yet base our basic energy production on renewable sources. That is why we need nuclear energy to protect the atmosphere. Mr President, on behalf of the PSE political group, I am delighted with the outcome of the conciliation procedure on the ALTENER II programme. First of all, however, I would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Mr Langen, who has done an excellent job with this report. I would also like to thank Mr Provan, chairman of our delegation to the conciliation committee, because, as Mr Langen has already said, this procedure was a very difficult battle. The outcome of the conciliation today also bears the clear imprint of the European Parliament. Mr Langen pointed out that the Council had taken up a number of the contents and requests of Parliament and that on the most controversial point, the financial allocation of the multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community, we still managed to meet the Council almost halfway. I would like to reiterate that we are not satisfied with this, but that we accepted the compromise because we considered it essential that the programme could be launched very soon. In the coming years, in fact, the aim is to double the share of renewable energy sources, bringing it to at least 12% of total energy consumption. Given this declared objective of the European Union, the only EU programme aimed exclusively at promoting renewable energy sources, the ALTENER programme, plays a truly decisive role. The new five-year programme aims first of all to expand the initiatives of the ALTENER I programme, including the intensification of the exchange of information and experience between operators in the renewable energy sector, the consolidation of existing local and regional energy agencies, the creation of new agencies and the promotion of existing networks. These are just a few examples. However, it seems to me that the ALTENER II programme is particularly important because for the first time it includes initiatives to facilitate the market penetration of renewable energy and to implement, monitor and control the Community strategy and action plan.	it
This has nothing to do with a lack of commitment to improving human rights, but rather demonstrates our usual concern for the right strategy so that we can achieve real results. I would like to illustrate these efforts by looking at three controversial issues: the death penalty, Cuba, and China. I will include one or two personal views in my remarks, even though this may be unwise. We are currently exploring the possibility of submitting a resolution on the death penalty to the Human Rights Commission. This has always been a matter of great personal interest to me, and I have consistently opposed the death penalty. Spurred on by Amnesty International and others, abolishing the death penalty was one of my first official actions as Governor of Hong Kong. We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly. We were forced to put our motion on hold on the death penalty to prevent the adoption of a resolution containing completely unacceptable arguments that would have resulted in human rights not being universally applied and valid everywhere. The stage in New York is different from the one in Geneva. The issues of sovereignty and humanitarian intervention, which were discussed in New York last year, were such sensitive areas that they influenced all other topics. This certainly also affected the discussion on a moratorium on the death penalty. However, the debate in Geneva will primarily focus on human rights issues. Therefore, progress may be more likely in Geneva. The second point concerns Cuba. I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are unfairly criticized for not taking human rights violations there seriously enough. We are deeply concerned about the measures the Cuban government has taken over the past year to curtail citizens' freedom. These include, for example, changes to the penal code and the extension of the death penalty. We are also deeply concerned about the recent increase in political imprisonment. We are monitoring the human rights situation through NGO reports and the work of our human rights working group set up in the EU embassies in Havana. We have regularly informed the Cuban authorities about the points we have criticized, and this Parliament has done likewise. However, I believe it is wrong to isolate Cuba. We want a just and open society in Cuba, a Cuba in which the principles of a market economy and the rule of law are respected, and treaties are honored. We want to promote the transition to democracy and strengthen respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Many of these positions also apply to my third topic: China. I am, quite simply, in favor of making our position vis-à-vis China clear. A different stance would not only be convenient and nonsensical, it would be offensive to more than one-fifth of humanity. I hope that China will develop peacefully toward a free and pluralistic society in which people who advocate for democracy or belong to a religious community are not put behind bars. So how should we proceed? In any case, we should engage in intensive trade with China and hope that we can admit China into the World Trade Organization under reasonable conditions.	de
"We agree on this point and I believe that the result we are delivering this evening, despite the lack of funding, will serve to widely relaunch this strategy and this opportunity for Europe that determines an economic and development factor: culture, therefore, the institutional and organizational component of a large community as presupposes economic development, and not the other way around, as Europe perhaps envisaged in the past, with a cultural habit. Man, culture have priority, and this culture can induce economic development. Let us observe this result, rejoice in it and award ourselves a certificate of great openness in the face of a useful strategy. Madam President, allow me, first of all, to thank Mr. Graça Moura for having managed to slip into the texture of this conciliatory fabric. It seems to me that, beginning the conciliatory process relating to Culture 2000, it is entirely appropriate that a poet guides us in our efforts. Once again, because these consultations are not entirely without difficulties, we must thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary ability to negotiate a complex issue: ensuring that cultural spending is done wisely and is granted to us, within our Community. The fundamental question, I believe, facing Parliament, the Commission and the Council is this: what is Europe? What does it mean and what does it bring us beyond the parameters of our national borders? Europe is made up of its citizens, its history and now its collectivity, but this is why Culture 2000 is so important to us: I bet that when we ask the question ""what is Europe"", we answer with ""our art, our literature and our heritage"". This is what Culture 2000 represents. This programme offers the possibility of maintaining a European identity in the 21st century, an identity that avoids the echoes of division, war, poverty, opportunity, and poverty in reality. More than that, and this is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we are able to learn the lessons of previous political initiatives by implementing them in new comprehensive, horizontal programmes that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they need it. It encourages mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded. My only regret is that we do not have sufficient funding, in promoting this programme, to achieve our aspirations and guarantee our capacity to deliver. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached the end of a long journey. After the conciliation stage, our institutions can now formally adopt the new ""Culture 2000"" framework programme. We will thus have a tool that is perfectly suited to developing, over the next five years, a clear, well-structured and, I am sure, fruitful action in favor of the cultural sector. It is with satisfaction that I welcome this happy ending here today and I thank you."	fr
We are doing this; the resources and programs are there. I need—I must make this clear to you—this financial regulation, which is pending here for a decision, so that we can even begin. The financial regulation is the legal framework that enables us to address the priorities set out in the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus. I cannot begin anything until we have that, because I lack the legal basis. If the complained-about lack of coherence has anything to do with this point, then I must say that this regulation is merely a legal framework and nothing more. You will find the details of this legal framework in the priorities of the accession partnerships, which were adopted last year by the Commission and Council and are now being implemented in the corresponding programming and project management. I would say quite the opposite: there are many areas in European policy where one can complain about a lack of coherence. In this case, I would also like to acknowledge, on behalf of the Commission and the Council, that we have developed a very clear, transparent, and coherent policy. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, since the Commissioner has explained to us in an extraordinarily coherent manner that the lack of coherence was the responsibility of the then President-in-Office of the Council and his Minister of State for Europe, perhaps you could help us and the Commissioner so that this decision can be taken here. A helpful solution would be if you could answer my questions about the financial perspective up to 2004 and heading B7 in the affirmative, or at least express that—as the Commissioner will also try to do in the Commission—the Portuguese Presidency intends to make up for the lack of coherence of that time through such an effort. Mr President, I think the question raised by the honourable Member and my friend Elmar Brok will be carefully examined by the Council. I believe the criticism leveled at the previous Presidency is unjustified. In my view, the previous Presidency did an excellent job in defining the financial perspective, regardless of the people involved. In any case, this is an important issue, and at Council level we will definitely support the Commission's proposals on this matter. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I understand; Mr Brok was actually referring to an even earlier presidency. Mr President, I put a specific question to Commissioner Verheugen about the Meda financial instrument, but he did not answer it. I would sincerely ask him to do so, because the voting on various amendments before us will depend on his answer. Mr Poos, I apologize. There was a ambiguity precisely at the point where you asked me the question. With Meda, Malta and Cyprus can participate in the cross-regional programs, but not in the country-specific ones because their incomes are too high. Thank you very much, Commissioner Verheugen! The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday. Question Time (Council) The next item is Question Time (B5-0009/2000). We will deal with questions to the Council.	de
However, according to the SCRS investigation, the 6.4 kg rule was inadequately enforced in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. WWF reports that, according to Italian, French, and Spanish customs services, illegal bluefin tuna catches and landings of juveniles are increasing. I cannot and do not want to elaborate further on this. We are all pressed for time. Mr. President, I would like to once again congratulate our rapporteur, Mr. Gallagher. Thank you, Commissioner Fischler. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. Fisheries and the Environment: 2nd Report following Bergen The next item is the report (A5-0016/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the second report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of the conclusions of the Ministerial Meeting on Fisheries and the Environment held in Bergen on 13 and 14 March 1997 (COM(1999) 270 - C5-0156/1999 - 1999/2150(COS)). Mr President, Mr Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, the report I am presenting concerns the important issue of integrating the environment-fisheries binomial, which was discussed at the ministerial meeting in Bergen. Personally, this integration has always concerned me, because we would be doing a disservice to the fishing industry and the fishermen of tomorrow if we failed to emphasize the need to conserve stocks and, ultimately, to engage in responsible fishing. Failure to do so would mean not only bread today but hunger tomorrow for our fishermen and European citizens, but – even more seriously – for all of humanity. The Common Fisheries Policy is theoretically very demanding and rigorous in this area, perhaps more so than many people – many Europeans and many non-Europeans alike – can imagine. For this reason, I have called on the European Commission to publish an inventory of all the Common Fisheries Policy measures for the conservation and protection of stocks, in order to disseminate our protective measures. We have also asked DG4 of our Parliament to prepare a systematic study of these measures for the members of our Committee on Fisheries. The revision of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2002 is the greatest challenge within a fixed timeframe for a comprehensive review, a modernization—or updating, if you will—of the Common Fisheries Policy as a whole. I insist on the whole, and consequently also on the protection of fishery resources being taken into account in the Common Fisheries Policy. This is the essence of my request to the European Commission and to the services of our Parliament. I do not believe that the state of the stocks or the scandalous current discard system are a good example of the goodness of the system, which, in my view, therefore requires significant improvements. I cannot and do not want to dwell on this too much; we are all aware of the relentlessness of the clock and also the working hours of interpreters. Therefore, I would like to remind you that Bergen represents a very important example of what the creation of a genuine maritime policy must look like. As the President-in-Office of the Council said to our committee when he announced that the current Portuguese Presidency wanted to ensure that fishing was seen as a policy aimed at preserving our sustainable resources, that must be our objective in Europe and on the planet.	de
The same applies to Amendment 2, which we would also consider acceptable with a slight modification, as the underlying idea seems correct to us. Amendment 4 has more or less the same characteristics. On this specific point, we could possibly give Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction. We have already asked the Council to include in its decision a statement from the Commission establishing this element of conditionality. What we are proposing specifically, regarding the second tranche, is that the exact amount and the time at which the second tranche will be implemented should be decided, taking into account Kosovo's external financial needs and the contribution of other bilateral donors. In other words, we are not imposing conditionality, or we believe it is more effective not to impose conditionality from the outset, but we are imposing it when the second tranche is eventually granted. This way, we would not have any problems acting immediately, we would not create problems for the people of Kosovo, but, on the other hand, we would force other donors to make their financial effort in the same way that we do. Mrs. Dührkop raised a third problem, in the area of multiannual programs. The projects are, as a reminder, multiannual. The programs must, of course, take into account annual budgetary contributions. Finally, I would like to make a comment on the requests for additional information that you are requesting from us. On the one hand, we have been asked to provide Parliament with the progress of calls for tenders and in this regard, I can tell you that the Commission already had the opportunity, last week, to provide Parliament's Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments made since the task force was set up in Kosovo. The Commission can undertake to continue to keep Parliament regularly informed of published calls for tenders. We also hope that they will be published on the Internet, in order to ensure the greatest transparency on this specific point. A second point on which I would like to comment is the remaining information that may be important for Parliament regarding the implementation of macroeconomic assistance. In this regard, I also inform you that the Commission is willing to regularly inform the chairmen of the various parliamentary committees concerned, on a confidential basis, if the nature of the information provided so requires, and on the various schemes that are implemented for macroeconomic assistance operations. I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that, with the Council's final decision, we will be able to release these funds and make a positive contribution that will allow us to continue the important effort that everyone is making to improve the coexistence and peace that we all desire. Mr President, I welcome the convergence of views that exists between Parliament, the Committee on Budgets in particular, and the Commission, and I assure you that, for our part, we will always be faithful to the meeting to help the Commission carry out its task.	fr
"These are some of the main reasons why we do not agree with the motion for a resolution before us. The European Parliament Labour abstained from the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulous report. The text is too ambitious, and the British Labour EP believes that the Intergovernmental Conference should primarily deal with the issues still outstanding after Amsterdam, in order to prepare for enlargement, without going too far away from these issues. Work is currently being done hard on reform, and for the time being this must remain a priority if we are to ensure the consolidation and strengthening of the Community institutions. A broadening of the agenda and a drastic revision of the Treaties would carry a risk of destabilisation. The key element of the text, as amended, is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be attached to the Treaties. In our view this would be a heavy legislative burden, whereas it would be preferable to have a written political declaration explaining to citizens what their rights are. Our priorities (so-called ""left-overs"") must be: the number and responsibilities of Commissioners the weighting of votes in the Council the extension of qualified majority voting in some areas, to the benefit of the UK and Europe (but excluding Treaty changes, defence issues, border control and taxation), with consequent extension of codecision where qualified majority voting applies. In addition to this, we believe that the proposal to introduce the concept of ""flexibility"" and to increase cooperation is not appropriate at the present time. The Amsterdam provisions have not been sufficiently tested, and extending the option of opting out could weaken the European Union at a time when we are talking about enlargement and candidate countries are being asked to accept the single market and other European laws. In order to influence the developments underway, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference than the line which emerges from this resolution, which is excessively full of disappointment and defeatism towards the decision taken in Helsinki in December 1999. The European Parliament and its Committee on Constitutional Affairs should instead have concentrated more precisely on a well-defined number of aspects not included in the Helsinki decision, indicating the elements considered most urgent to be addressed, including the question of public prosecution for crimes committed against the institutions of the Union and their financial interests. We Swedish Christian Democrats are also opposed to the threat to delay enlargement to the East if the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference is not substantially extended, well beyond what the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam left unresolved in 1997. The most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will be to reform the Union with a view to its enlargement to the new Member States. I therefore naturally agree that Parliament should now give its formal green light to the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference. However, I believe that this conference should be limited to those aspects which are indispensable for enlargement. For the rest, I refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999, in which I clarify my position on the supranational character and common defence."	it
"The Commission would like to see a greater role for the Joint Assembly, particularly in promoting broader political dialogue with our development partners. The Commission shares the rapporteur's view that the fight against poverty must continue to be a priority objective of development policy and that it must continue to play a key role. However, in order to develop, countries must be actively involved in the global economic system. In the area of trade with our development partners, the Commission is quite prepared to ensure that the particular economic and social frameworks of the ACP countries are taken into account in any new arrangement. Mrs. Lucas said that the Stabex and Sysmin systems should be continued. I personally do not believe this. These systems have proven inadequate because they actually benefit only a very small number of the 71 countries concerned. These systems are too slow, and it is therefore normal that the developing countries have said ""yes"" to the new system that will be used in the future, because it will be more flexible. Regarding the future accession of certain countries to the Lomé Convention, such as East Timor, I can only repeat what I recently said before the European Parliament's Committee on Development, namely that the door is open to them. It is up to the candidate countries to decide for themselves whether they wish to apply. We will then take a position on them. Regarding Cuba's application for accession to the Lomé Convention, the Commission noted that, on the basis of their recent statement, the ACP states will support Cuba's application. The EU has always advocated a constructive attitude towards Cuba - the EU's common position demonstrates this - but it must be recognized that the discussions will be complicated. Regarding Côte d'Ivoire, I can announce that the €28 million has been repaid in full, in accordance with the agreement reached following the investigation into the financial irregularities identified. As regards the financing of the European Development Fund through the budget, I would like to state that this is currently under review. For its part, the Commission is in favour of it, but we cannot, at this stage, make any new statements about when this will be possible or how it will be achieved. Regarding Article 366A, I would like to say that a new procedure was created, during the negotiations on a new partnership agreement, for examining cases of violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. As is already the case today, Parliament will continue, after the adoption of the Treaty of Amsterdam and on the basis of Article 300, to be kept fully informed of all decisions taken, and the Commission will continue to take into account the resolutions adopted by Parliament on this matter. There is no provision for such decisions to follow the procedure of asking Parliament to issue a concurring opinion. This would require an amendment to the Treaty of Amsterdam, which has just been signed."	fr
"However, precisely, the entire Commission communication is built on the opposite premise, according to which it would be necessary, under the pretext of better defending people, to ever further limit their scope for autonomous choice through new regulations, new policy integrations or new binding legal structures such as the draft charter, quite wrongly called, of fundamental rights. I emphasize ""quite wrongly"" because, in fact, it will reduce these rights. In the Europe of Nations Group, our principles are quite different. We want to defend the countries of Europe, but also respect the choices of the people. This is not at all squaring the circle. We must indeed move away from outdated federalist models, the models of those whose ideas, in European matters, come all the way from the Memoirs of Jean Monnet. On the contrary, we must open the European institutions to the modern world by inventing a dynamic of variable geometry that respects nations. This is the great idea on the new governance that we would have liked to find in your communication, Mr President, unfortunately, it was not there. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, you claim to be shaping a new Europe, but you are, alas, lacking one essential condition: trust. You cannot, in fact, attract the trust of millions of Europeans when you are not worthy of it. And how could you be worthy of trust after the mad cow disease affair, after the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption? You bear the responsibility for millions of unemployed and millions of poor people, for the precariousness and growing poverty because of your ultra-trade and ultra-liberal policies, because of the forced march towards the single currency. You wanted and organized the disappearance of internal borders and you have thus delivered Europe to the explosion of crime and insecurity, to the surge of uncontrolled immigration. Today you propose giving all decision-making power to a handful of civil servants by making states, local authorities and NGOs, all of whom are placed on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels, mere executors of decisions made from above. Not once in your fourteen-page document are national parliaments mentioned, even though they are composed of elected representatives of the people. But it is true that they have no role in your strategy. You do not even dare to call a spade a spade and you take refuge behind pseudo-trendy semantics to call ""governance"" what is nothing other than a federal, autocratic and centralized government. After having, for years, tried to convince by talking about shared sovereignty, you now admit your ultimate goal: to sell off all European sovereignty, whether national or collective, to a world government, in which you do not even hope to obtain a leading position. Finally, you dare to condemn and punish, or allow others to condemn and punish, the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians simply because you don't like the result. And at the same time, you support Communist China and trade with countries that have been openly violating human rights for decades. Even today, MEPs are protesting against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel, which, however, is clearly not a show of sympathy, but a political maneuver."	fr
"Here we are in an area where the principle of subsidiarity applies in full. Each Member State has a primary duty to define its own responsibilities towards children. As regards the responsibility of the Union as such, I believe it is necessary for children's rights to be recognised in the Charter, taking into account the areas in which the Union can bring added value to the promotion of the social, economic and also civic situation, in the broadest sense, of children. I hope that we will be able to meet the challenge that the honourable Member has launched to the Commission and to the whole Convention. Mr President, I have had the honour of listening to the Commissioner on this issue on several occasions and I fully share his approach. However, I would like to ask a slightly different question. We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is keen to improve communication with citizens and to focus the Commission's information policy on the main issues that the Community is dealing with this year. Would the Commissioner be in favour of allocating part of the Commission's information budget to a campaign to raise awareness among citizens about the Citizens' Charter? It is very important that citizens feel part of this process. I know that the Convention itself will do a lot in this area, but it does not have the resources that the Commission has. Will the Commission consider using the information budget to ensure that citizens participate in the debate? The Commission's policy is to promote an open and broad dialogue on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organisations, but also with citizens, on a project as far-reaching as the Charter. I can assure you that the Commission will do its utmost to launch a debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights. If we end up with a clear text, easy for citizens to read, and at the same time legally binding, we will kill two birds with one stone: the two are not mutually exclusive. The challenge is to ensure that both are ensured in the final version of the Charter. I am very pleased to know that I can count on your support. Question No. 40, by the Honourable Member (H-0095/00): Subject: Articles 6(1), 7(1) and 7(2) of the Treaty on European Union Article 6(1) of the Treaty states that the Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. From statements made in recent years it is clear that Jörg Haider and his party (Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs - FPÖ) do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in relation to third-country nationals and minorities residing in Austria. Accordingly, can the Commission indicate when it intends to propose, pursuant to Article 7(1), that ""the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles referred to in Article 6(1)"" be contested and to urge the Council, acting by a qualified majority, to suspend certain of Austria's rights under the Treaty, including the right to vote of Austria's representative in the Council?"	it
"This term, moreover, seems to have been dropped from the Commission's vocabulary, whereas liberal and American references abound. Romano Prodi invokes the highly controversial concept of ""governance,"" controversial because it prioritizes dirigism over the proper functioning of democracy and because it refers to the term defined by the IMF, whose ideological content is entirely shaped by liberalism and monetarism. This is not a mere semantic difference. Reading this document, one is struck by the thought that it is only about the completion of the internal market and the goal of general deregulation, and not about the reorientation of European politics hoped for by our fellow citizens. Romano Prodi speaks only of ""mechanisms"" and ""structures,"" but he does not describe balanced projects that correspond to the wishes of our peoples. Enlargement appears to be an end in itself; However, if no social policy, no common values, and no institution to strengthen cohesion and further democratize the Union are adopted, the Europe left behind at the end of Prodi's presidency could be a simple common market within a generalized globalization, rather than the community of shared destiny we hoped for. Finally, the leniency shown by Romano Prodi toward Austria in the name of purely formal compliance with the law—which, incidentally, in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations—would in itself justify a vote of no confidence. The European Union does not hold back from clearly announcing its expansionist ambitions. The Commission's objective for the next five-year period is to become a ""player on the world stage"" capable of playing a ""primary leadership role in the world."" The European Union has not changed in its essence. From the outset, its actions were determined by a few dozen large economic and financial corporations and their interest groups. But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the European Union in order to assert a common claim to leadership on the world stage with the United States, with which it simultaneously competes and rivals. This new imperial policy entails a reform of European and national institutions, the strengthening of state power, fiercer competition, a European army, and the redistribution of financial resources. That anyone still dares to speak of defending a ""European social model"" is a shameful lie, because the more the European Union opposes the United States, the more it becomes its faithful reflection. We vote against these goals because we oppose such policies in Parliament and in the streets. The drafting of a European Charter of Fundamental Rights would be the only small glimmer of hope in this policy, but again, there is no provision for making this a matter for the peoples of Europe and allowing them to decide on it democratically. We abstained from voting on the resolution for the following reasons: First, the resolution does not sufficiently demonstrate the vagueness of the priorities and commitments reflected in the Commission's programme. Furthermore, we believe that the main issue facing the Commission in setting priorities for the next five years relates to its role in interinstitutional relations within the EU—and this is where both the programme and the resolution are lacking."	de
It is clear that we need to convert old methods of social spending into new economic and social opportunities. We need to free ourselves from the policies and methods that have condemned a generation of Europeans to be second-class citizens on the world stage, and to do so we need to enable Europe and its people to develop their full potential. If Lisbon succeeds in achieving these objectives that have been discussed today, it will be an important step forward in unleashing the dynamic to which I have referred. Prime Minister, we too would like to believe with you, and with the Portuguese Presidency, that the construction of Europe must be the construction of a civilisation whose economic and social prosperity is based on the valorisation of knowledge, cultural diversity and cohesion, a civilisation that plays an active role in promoting a more balanced, more peaceful and more supportive world order. And we would also like to believe with you that there is a clear and general awareness of the fact that the extent of the foreseeable transformations in terms of qualifications needed to face the new technological challenges that companies are dealing with also includes, at the same time, the risk of new processes of social exclusion, to quote your words once again. We would like to believe it, but we can't. Why? Because we know that the new economy certainly allows the emergence of new employment opportunities for creative people and for computer scientists. The feverish agitation with which new investors are always appearing and with which the phenomenon of start-ups is developing is before our eyes, but we are also equally aware of the continuous turnover of personnel at telephone exchanges, due to the appalling working conditions prevailing in these new sanctuaries of Taylorism in which hundreds of thousands of dependent workers are employed. We know that more than half of the jobs created in the Union at present are precarious, temporary, forced rather than chosen part-time and that, by virtue of this, they cannot guarantee those who occupy them the conditions of personal autonomy - and often not even an income - that would guarantee a decent life. We know that new technologies in themselves do not generate more democracy, but only more individual and collective autonomy for the most socially integrated citizens. We know that the privatization of public services jeopardises social, territorial and regional cohesion, and we also know that the Commission proposes to accelerate it. We know that UNICE, on behalf of employers, is announcing very clearly from now on the tone of the preparatory documents for the European Business Summit, scheduled for Brussels in June: public authorities will be asked to remove all social, regulatory and fiscal obstacles to the development of the business world, but also to invest massively in the consolidation of demand. And finally, we know that those who pride themselves on providing answers to the needs of citizens must first of all guarantee their full participation in choices regarding public policies. All things that we know well. Yet we have read or heard nothing to suggest that the recommendation of the High Level Expert Group, according to which the full economic success of the information society presupposes that it is fuelled by the real needs of the citizen, rather than by the market forces of technology companies alone, will be taken into account.	it
Therefore, Madam Vice-President, following the electoral victory of a certain party in a large country, you would make my evening even more enjoyable if you were to say: we can support the rapporteur's Amendment No 3! I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this extremely important issue and also express my thanks to the Commissioner and the Commission for this proposal. We welcome the fact that, among other things, the Portuguese Presidency has set itself the goal of doing something about the scandalous state of road safety in the European Union. I know that these figures are well known, but let me quickly remind you: 43 000 citizens are killed in road accidents every year. This means that practically a medium-sized town is wiped out every year. We welcome the initiative presented because it at least makes an attempt to ensure that commercial vehicles are as safe as possible and comply with Community legislation. Commercial vehicle traffic on European roads is constantly increasing, both in terms of number and size. In our view, there are three reasons why this proposal is so important. First, there is the safety argument, which has already been mentioned. The second argument, which my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, has already explained, is fair competition and the need to create a level playing field throughout the Community. Third, there are the positive environmental aspects, as this proposal will make it possible to use quieter and less polluting vehicles in the future. Random checks must be carried out throughout the EU. In my country, the United Kingdom, such a system is already in operation with very positive results. While this proposal will inevitably have negative consequences for the black sheep among hauliers, other road users, in particular the vast majority of lorry drivers, vehicle owners, and hauliers who are conscientious about the quality, safety, and compliance with environmental standards of their vehicles, will benefit from it. I welcome this initiative and hope it will be implemented as soon as possible. Mr President, Ms de Palacio, The amendment of the directive on annual roadworthiness tests for commercial vehicles is a matter of urgency and importance. The rapporteur has also ultimately reached a good conclusion here. Commercial vehicles cover a great many kilometers each year, and their condition cannot be effectively monitored through annual inspections alone. Unannounced roadside inspections are also necessary because dilapidated heavy goods vehicles from third countries often travel within the Union, posing a serious safety risk. The amendment of the directive aims to significantly increase road safety if the regulations are properly complied with and if penalties can be imposed for violations that are effective, targeted, and dissuasive. The effectiveness of the directive will be increased if Member States can consult on the harmonisation of penalties. However, this must not delay the rapid implementation of the directive. One argument for the rapid amendment of the directive is a recent case in Finland. Police and supervisory authorities recently inspected 62 heavy goods vehicles in eastern Finland, of which 30 were fined and 16 were given warnings.	de
"It marks the beginning of a contractual stabilization of the countries of the former Yugoslavia. These are the countries that are not yet eligible for a pre-accession agreement. In fact, the current agreement is a kind of ""pre-pre-agreement,"" but with a view to future accession. This union of countries through active treaties is an excellent instrument, provided that the agreed provisions are resolutely respected and the desired stabilization is thus achieved. Macedonia remains a potential powder keg, and its entire history bears witness to this. Yet it has the ambition to shake off this reputation. To achieve this, it needs internal stability. The new government wants to tackle the issue, and the agreement can be a timetable for reform, including a direct role and an equal position for the Albanian minority. The country especially needs calm now, to restore order to the situation and find the path to greater prosperity. We Social Democrats call on the opposition to behave in accordance with these notions. They must also contribute to the Macedonian model so highly praised here. But the country also and above all needs external stability. What good is internal stability if the surrounding area is unstable? This stability is necessary in relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania, and Bulgaria. The region must recognize that Macedonia exists and will continue to exist. External stability means open borders and regional cooperation. Minorities and majorities must have opportunities for cultural and human exchange. Macedonia's stability is closely linked to developments in neighboring countries. The Kosovo problem is well known, and the international community is present there en masse. It seems that the Albania factor is underestimated. The Union believes that the time is not yet right to sign a Stability and Association Agreement with this country. But what is needed then? It is precisely the arguments put forward for concluding such an agreement with Macedonia and not with Albania that concern us and lead us to say that a wait-and-see attitude on the part of the Union towards Albania is unacceptable. What does the Commission do with this consideration? Yugoslavia is also a weak link in terms of stability and therefore poses a threat to a stable Macedonia. We must wait and see how the situation develops. Belgrade's mood is becoming increasingly unpredictable. However, we support the Council's decision to change the direction of sanctions. This, at last, is a serious attempt to support the opposition, which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations. What else will the Union do in this regard if the opposition's demand for early elections is accepted? What more can we do and what more can we undertake to support this opposition? Mr President, Commissioner, the Kosovo affair has hopefully marked the end of an era in which the rights of peoples could be interpreted in a way that left dictators free to persecute minorities in the most terrible ways, as long as these persecutions took place ""within the nation""."	fr
The rapporteur has informed Parliament that the Council's common position incorporates six of the ten amendments to the text tabled by Parliament at first reading, as well as the substance of Parliament's other amendments. Consequently, my group will support the common position and hopes for swift enactment of legislation, which will provide us with another tool in our fight to ensure that transport within the Union achieves the highest possible level of safety. My group will also support any initiative aimed at improving transport safety. We still have a lot to do in this area, as current events show. Madam President, I would like to make a few remarks. First, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his extremely precise technical work on this file, and secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has put forward. This concerns the harmonization of examination requirements, but also of minimum requirements. In a certain sense, this is a shame. The importance of safety on the road, on the rails, or on waterways is naturally paramount, and due to the international nature of these modes of transport, we must also harmonize the training of safety advisors, as well as, in particular, the requirements of the new ADR, which should soon come into force. This is important, but compliance with these measures is just as important, and there are naturally several reasons why we must pay particular attention to this. Let us examine the road accidents of recent years. For example, in Belgium, the Netherlands, and certain other countries, during foggy weather, with trucks transporting dangerous goods, when in such conditions they should have stayed on the side of the road. Or boatmen and their ships from Eastern Europe who moor their boats side by side, making dangerous situations all the more obvious. Furthermore, an investigation conducted in Belgian, Finnish, and Japanese ports revealed that 50 percent of containers with partially dangerous cargo were not properly unloaded. In short, the subject is very important. If we look at the situation of safety advisors, since January 1, in some countries, companies must have such an advisor. Compliance with this principle currently poses significant problems, especially for smaller companies that cannot afford it financially. They will either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which creates a series of problems. For this reason, there are requests that these activities be developed in the form of annual reports, company analyses, and possibly included in ISO 9002 certificates. The work is done; it is still a matter of ensuring compliance. Allow me to raise one last point. With regard to this compliance, satisfactory agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries, because it is not until July 1, 2001, in a little over a year and a half, that they will adhere to the current conventions.	fr
"However, my experience is that these branches of production manage quite well. They often have too much capital and are often overindulged. I have seen computer companies treated with incredible condescension. I believe, on the contrary, that resources should be used to try to prevent the disintegration of society, a division of society into two sectors: a new economy and an old one. Integration mechanisms should be created specifically. Perhaps the most important thing would be the creation of an infrastructure that would provide opportunities for the non-expansive branches of the economy and for population groups on the periphery. For this reason, I believe we should focus on computers in daycare centers, broadband cabling in sparsely populated areas, technologically focused public libraries, and on not weakening the public sector. Mr. President, the agenda of the Lisbon Council, to be held on March 23 and 24, is staggering. At the chapter headings alone, we see mention of the Europe of innovation and knowledge, structural reforms, competitiveness, the European social model, employment, social cohesion, macroeconomic policies, and sustainable growth. On that basis, it is hardly surprising that the many contributions from the Commission Presidency and the Member States tend, for now, to be scattered in all directions. This exercise could end in two very different ways: either it allows for a broad exchange of stimulating ideas, which each will then try to implement in their own countries, possibly with joint initiatives in the new field of electronic exchange—and that scenario would not be such a bad one after all—or the Council insists on announcing results in terms of the transfer of powers to Europe, and we will head towards greater centralization and bureaucracy, in other words, the exact opposite of what is needed. Reading the preparatory documents gives us some apprehensions in this regard. We learned that—pardon the jargon, but it's not mine—we must achieve better convergence of the Cologne process regarding macroeconomic policy coordination, the Cardiff process regarding structural reforms, and the Luxembourg process regarding employment policy coordination, while also enriching the content of the employment pact and the multilateral monitoring of budgetary policies. But how can we achieve better convergence of all these very different processes? The conclusion of the Presidency document dated January 12 provides the key. We would need to reform the broad economic policy guidelines, the GOPs, which currently only have the status of annual recommendations from the Council to the Member States, to broaden their scope and, above all, to strengthen their status as a ""framework"" document. Apparently, the word ""framework"" should be understood here with its double meaning of synthesis and obligation."	es
I think we should congratulate ourselves on this. But what arguments did the Commission, and specifically Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu, have for not having the URBAN program? Their argument was compelling. The urban issue is so important that we cannot limit it and almost undervalue it with a program that has very little budget. Today we have the program, and therefore, I believe we have achieved something important, that hallmark of the European Union: URBAN. But I wanted to address Commissioner Barnier to support the arguments of the Commissioner and the Director-General, because I believe they were quite right. The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply into all the Structural Funds. The budgetary level required by our cities—home to 80% of the European population and which are becoming a large part of both the good and the bad that we have in Europe—I believe precisely demands that this European dimension be taken into account and that this URBAN program not be used as a justification for failing to conduct in-depth analysis, for failing to prioritize, and therefore for failing to introduce an infinitely larger budget allocation for programs that affect cities through all European funds. Therefore, I believe it is unnecessary to list the number of factors that demand this investment in urban areas, factors that are the order of the day, and I would like to convey to the Commissioner that we await his sensitivity in this regard. In embracing the cross-sectoral approach embodied in the new EQUAL initiative, it is crucial that the programme seek to combat the various forms of discrimination against people with disabilities, particularly physical barriers in the workplace, which affect people with limited mobility, visual information systems, which exclude blind workers, and employment systems that slam the door on people with learning difficulties or mental health problems. Disability organizations and non-disabled representatives of people with disabilities must take a genuine interest in every stage of decision-making. This is why this Parliament has proposed paragraphs 10 and 15 of the regulation to ensure that Member States cannot leave out any of the groups targeted by this initiative. People with disabilities have already been left out of the list too often. Because people with disabilities do not form a homogeneous group—for example, many deaf people are considered a linguistic minority discriminated against for having their own language and culture—it is necessary to allow for the definition of certain associations that are specific to a disability or a particular group, as stipulated in Section 9. EQUAL remains crucial in regions, like my own in the east of England, that are left out of the main Objective 1 grants. We have benefited from an extra incentive to resume funding for Community initiatives, which has had an excellent record of response. Former ADAPT projects include projects such as CORE, which developed new supply chains for the automotive industry in Bedfordshire, and projects aimed at improving the standards of small businesses in Hertfordshire, Essex.	es
Until now, Member States calculated this GDP according to the ESA 79 methodology. The last assessment available to us was transmitted in September 1999 and relates to the 1998 financial year. If this Regulation is adopted, the notification of March 2000, the first assessment of the deficit for the 1999 financial year, will therefore already be made according to this new system. As is well known, the Member States have done their duty—if one can put it that way—by calculating and compiling their national accounts in accordance with the ESA 95 and have already published their corresponding assessments. This required, in addition to the introduction of the new methodology, the nominal revision of most aggregates and accounting transactions, both because of the aforementioned methodological changes and because of the improved statistical information incorporated into the estimates. These changes may, of course, alter the government deficits in the context of the Member States' national accounts. I would like to briefly outline the five areas in which the most significant changes will occur. First, the adjustments to the definition of what is understood as the institutional sector of public administrations according to ESA 95. This is important because the government deficit refers to the revenue, if any, of all public administrations. The lack of precise criteria for its definition would lead to discrepancies in the assessments of government deficits by Member States. Second, the government deficit – or, as the case may be, the government surplus – corresponds to the designated balance of need or financing capacity of the ESA 95 public administrations sector. Third, public investment corresponds to the gross fixed capital formation of the public administrations sector according to ESA 95. Fourth, the ESA 95 defines government debt as well as the flows or interest resulting from these liabilities or assets. Fifth and finally, the aggregate to which the government deficit refers is gross domestic product at market prices, as defined by the 1995 System of National and Regional Accounts. Ultimately, I believe this Commission proposal is a correct and concrete adjustment of the criteria laid down in the 1995 System of National and Regional Accounts, which I therefore agree with in its entirety, as set out by the Commission. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me say at the outset that my group welcomes this proposal because it will make the statistical basis for an economic and monetary union oriented towards stability and real growth more harmonised, more directly comparable, and more accurate. We have already heard the various sectors. For me, it is crucial that, from now on, statistical data are more reliable and comparable. This is necessary because we must be able to rely on one another: the various institutions of the European Union and all the Member States within the monetary union. Adapting the procedure is important for two reasons. First, for the internal market. Reliable and directly comparable data and statistics are generally of great importance for an accurate representation of the situation and developments in a single market. Secondly, for Economic and Monetary Union. The 1993 regulation on the application of the Protocol must be aligned with the methodology of the European System of National and Regional Accounts.	de
"Thus, today we are witnessing a clear consolidation of the essential core of ""Thatcherite"" orientations, albeit softened by welfare measures. And this is not done by force of proclaimed conservative principles, under the guise of a supposedly globalizing pragmatism and in the name of a deified competitiveness. Therefore, it is not enough to call for the coordination of social policies or to insist on the innovation and knowledge society or on information technologies, however important they may be. It is essential to abandon this monetarist and antisocial perspective and definitively place the human person at the forefront of priorities and policies. My Group, which attaches particular importance to social issues, and taking into account the upcoming extraordinary Council, met last week in Lisbon precisely for the purpose of analyzing and debating these problems. There we had the opportunity to debate and hear from workers' representatives and trade unionists from Portugal and other parts of Europe, and we met, in particular, with representatives from ABB and Michelin, as well as with promoters of the job marches. We drew conclusions based on 14 points that we will officially communicate to the Council Presidency. For us, it is essential to adopt macroeconomic policy measures based on boosting demand and public investment and respecting renovated public services, aimed at full employment and guaranteeing an employment level of around 75% in 2010. It is necessary to guarantee a more labor-friendly income distribution, ensure the taxation of speculative capital movements, and combat tax fraud and evasion. It is necessary to hinder mergers and company relocations, particularly when they are aimed at and accompanied by layoffs. It is necessary to move forward with reducing working hours without reducing wages and without deteriorating job quality. It is necessary to reconsider the Union's financial perspectives, to decisively support small and medium-sized enterprises, to firmly commit to a revamped education system and to more and better vocational training, and to put an end to the discrimination that primarily affects women and young people. In light of this, and of the ability to formulate concrete objectives, duly expressed in figures and with a timetable in this crucial area, we will analyze and assess the results of the Lisbon Summit. Mr. President, the Lisbon Summit will generate a new repertoire of fine words. These words will be well received; however, the fundamental problem lies in the existence of an Economic and Monetary Union that puts the fight against inflation before employment. The Central Bank has stated that price increases must always remain below 2%; the Stability Pact stipulates that the annual budget deficit must not exceed 1%. There is no requirement that the unemployment rate be below 5% or—even better—below 2% or 1%. It is the price of money that must not rise, it is public spending that must not increase. A country may wish to limit unemployment through public investment, however, such an action is prohibited."	es
But who will ultimately pay the costs? Regardless of which system is adopted, it will be the consumer who pays the price. To best pursue environmental objectives, we should entrust the producers with both the task of collecting the money and of scrapping and recycling used cars. The producers have persuaded the Honourable Members Florenz and Lange to table amendments that significantly weaken the original proposals. Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers! If you want this directive to be as effective as possible, use your vote to reject these amendments. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate, contrary to what we might think, is not of a technical nature. It has become eminently political. Yesterday, we honoured our institution with a political debate. Today, it would be a disgrace for us if 314 Members were to give in to the power of the lobby of certain car manufacturers. By asking consumers to bear half the cost of taking back end-of-life vehicles, as set out in Amendment 38, while the common position provides that the entire cost of taking back is to be borne by the producer, for the first time Parliament would not present itself as the guarantor of the protection of consumers and European citizens, but would become in some way a sounding board for lobbies. We cannot accept this. It would be a precedent that would leave the door open to all kinds of pressure in many other areas. It would also be the first time that Parliament would water down a position of the Council, while in general, it seems to me, we are mainly criticising the positions of the Council. For example, the system of free take-back of old vehicles and the increase in the percentage of vehicles for recycling will proportionally increase recycling activities and the number of jobs. Therefore, for the consumer, for the environment, for the new jobs to be created in the recycling sector, there is absolutely no need to amend the Council's common position, which, as it stands, is fully acceptable. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that we need to think about how end-of-life vehicles are to be treated in Europe, but in this case the Council has not set an example of a good European environmental policy. The German Presidency has behaved shamefully in dealing with this issue. Firstly, Environment Minister Trittin has not sufficiently agreed on a common line with his government colleagues, then Chancellor Schröder has meddled in this matter without any knowledge of the facts and with the grace of an elephant in a china shop. The decision taken by the Finnish Presidency in June was also not the best that could have been achieved. There are some weaknesses: the main one, in my opinion, is that insufficient consideration is given to the situation of SMEs, but the car industry is not made up exclusively of large companies. In the supply sector in particular, SMEs play a leading role and we must also protect the interests of those employed in these companies, as well as more than two million people are employed in this sector.	it
"With the exception of Amendment 76, where I made a mistake because I intended to vote in favor, my votes could be explained by the following fictitious narrative: Draft environmental directive adopted: ""Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the obligation to maintain a temperature of at least 18 degrees Celsius in winter in the streets, squares and gardens of European towns and cities."" Main principles of the directive: a) Every town must equip itself with sufficient energy and technological resources to achieve this objective by 2012; b) The costs will be fully passed on to all town residents as part of the electricity price. A Member from Northern Europe commented: ""This directive would be unfair, because the costs for a resident of Stockholm, for example, would be 200 times higher than those for a resident of Naples."" A Member from Southern Europe commented: ""Nevertheless, this is competitiveness and a level playing field."" (The fiction ends here.) The Member, who now explains his voting behavior, considers it positive that there is a Community directive on water, but believes that Europe cannot be built on environmental dogmatism, but rather that we are falling into the caricature of legislation. Countries with periods of flooding and drought, such as the Mediterranean countries, cannot be treated in the same way as countries with a northern rainfall regime. On the other hand, a Europe that makes water transfers between different watersheds virtually impossible in the future would lack solidarity. It should be recalled once again that we are working on a project for the political unification of the entire continent. Drinking, eating, washing ourselves, cultivating fields, and much more: we need water for every activity in our daily lives. This water is wrongly considered an immutable and inexhaustible resource, since something as simple as turning on a tap is seemingly self-evident. But this source is in danger of drying up... All scientific studies now clearly conclude that water will be the key challenge of the coming years, and this will happen tomorrow. But tomorrow will be too late. We must clearly define the rules of the game today, before we all become losers. By adopting the Water Directive today, February 16, the European Parliament will be reaffirming its commitment to protecting surface water, coastal waters, inland waters, and groundwater. Europe now has a framework that will enable it to counteract the deterioration of water quality, promote the sustainable use of water, protect ecosystems, contribute to the fight against floods and droughts, and stop the discharge of dangerous substances. This is a lifebuoy that we are throwing into the water. I am extremely satisfied with this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy. The environmental disaster currently ravaging the banks of the Danube reminds us—if it were still necessary—that human negligence all too often endangers natural resources, such as water. The aim of this 1997 proposal for a directive is to put an end to the fragmentation that has characterized water legislation to date and to better protect surface, coastal, and inland waters, as well as groundwater. The proposal provides a framework for counteracting further deterioration, protecting ecosystems, promoting the sustainable use of water resources, contributing to the fight against floods and droughts, and gradually reducing the discharge of hazardous substances."	de
It is precisely this diversity of penal policies that must be addressed. Legislating well therefore means trying to develop real criteria for judicial convergence. It is also an opportunity to look in the face at the reality of Europe's prisons, which are often overcrowded: these are places of non-law, unworthy of the idea we have of ourselves. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, all our countries have abolished the death penalty for a long time. I assure you, however, that with almost a thousand suicides in prison every year, they have not truly abolished it. Mr President, judicial cooperation is undoubtedly essential for free-market Europe, but it must take place in the strictest respect for those principles that are the foundation of our civilisation: the fundamental human rights and freedoms, provided for by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. We can only thank the committees of Parliament, which have profoundly modified in a guaranteeist sense - through the introduction of numerous amendments - a report that, as initially set out, did not convince us at all. I address the Honourable Schultz to reiterate that the amendments are always presented by us not in a personal capacity or for personal reasons but in the context of a general political interest. If it is then a question of making a list of the people under investigation, or searching for the people under investigation, we could also find them among the rapporteurs, including the author of the report on this convention. I therefore believe that the Honourable Schultz could have spared himself certain forays. As I was saying, numerous amendments have been inserted that guarantee the rights of defence - I am thinking here of the obligation to request the judge for wiretapping - or the prohibition of the accumulation of investigative functions with judicial ones with regard to joint investigative teams. In short, Parliament wanted the convention to concern exclusively criminal matters; the limitation on freedom and fundamental rights provided for in the convention can only be limited to criminal matters. We need clear rules. Of course, the Council has acted in an uncoordinated manner, has changed its opinion during the proceedings, is absent. On the other hand, I thank Commissioner Vitorino for his presence in the Chamber during the debate. As I was saying, we need clear rules to have a fair trial in Europe - without an invasion of wiretaps, without the illicit use of video conferences - so that trials with magistrates who, instead of administering justice, play politics no longer happen in Europe, so that the real guilty parties are punished and not the innocent people who are inconvenient to someone. Mr President, the draft convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters between EU Member States is about to be adopted by the Council. In the opinion of many, it was about time; Indeed, according to the action plan designed to combat organised crime and adopted by the Council in April 1997, work on the draft MLA Convention should have been concluded by the end of 1997. It will still be some time before the Convention enters into force, as ratification by the Member States is required.	it
I would also like to point out that our intention to set up an observatory is not new. Such an observatory already existed under LEADER I and LEADER II. Its sole purpose is to maintain active links between the individual groups participating in LEADER. The funding of the observatory cannot exceed 2% of the LEADER budget. As regards the possibility of financing projects that include training and education activities, I would point out that this is a point that is now integrated into the new rural development policy and therefore, in our opinion, no longer needs to be addressed under LEADER. I will now turn to the substance of the report. Point 14 calls on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LEADER II to the European Parliament as soon as possible. In my opinion, there is little point in doing so at this stage, as it is still possible to use LEADER II funds until the end of 2001. We therefore believe it is more appropriate to carry out the evaluation once the programme has ended. We will certainly do so and submit a report on the matter to Parliament. In point 18, Parliament proposes to collect a sort of compendium or guide of positive actions carried out under LEADER I and II. I would like to inform you that it already exists, it has been compiled by the Commission and I can send it to anyone who is interested. In point 21, Parliament stresses that it is now necessary to approve the guidelines for LEADER+ with due speed, so that the programmes can be launched. I fully agree with the request. As soon as the opinion is adopted here in Parliament, the guidelines for LEADER+ will be submitted to the STAR Committee, so that the Member States can confirm the provisional approval given on 14 November. I expect the Commission to then be able to approve the final version of the guidelines in March/April. As soon as it is published in the Official Journal, there will only be a few months left, six to be precise, to present the LEADER+ programmes. I think it is important to underline that expenditure under LEADER+ can be financed from that moment, that is, when the Commission programme is available. For programmes submitted before 30 April this year, there is also the possibility of retroactively setting the start date of eligibility for funding to 1 January. Finally, in point 20, the draft resolution essentially contains seven amendments to the guidelines. After having examined them in detail, I confirm that the proposals put forward in points 2, 4, 5 and 7 are acceptable to the Commission and will be accepted. The proposal in point 6 can also be accepted, at least in part, as it reiterates that the Commission must approve programmes under LEADER+ within a maximum of five months. We believe that the amendment indicated in point 1 should now be considered superfluous as, following consultations with the representatives of the Member States in the STAR Committee, this point has already been reformulated, as desired by Parliament. Therefore, only the amendment reported in point 3 remains. The Commission cannot but agree with the request, given that it corresponds exactly to what it itself had initially proposed.	it
"However, let us also draw some conclusions. The electoral system that best fits this model is the zipper system, as voluntarily applied in Sweden. I would say that where possible, it should be voluntarily; and where there is reluctance, it should be imposed. I hope that the best practices of these countries can also be continued through benchmarking in the fifth action program, Madam Minister and Commissioner, since I believe it is time for our parties to understand this. Mr. President, I would also like to congratulate the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council for their comprehensive interventions and, above all, for their proposals. Since it has been said that men generally do not participate in debates concerning women's rights, I thought I would contribute to today's debate the opinion of a man, a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama. In an article entitled ""If Women Ruled the World,"" he defends the conviction that greater participation of women in politics would lead to a world much less prone to violence. Athena, the goddess of Wisdom and War, may have been a model for women for the ancients, but women's influence today can be an effective catalyst against war and for peace. There are, therefore, compelling reasons, beyond justice between the sexes, that advocate a fair and balanced distribution of public office, as well as political and economic power, between men and women. The entire life of women is interwoven with the offering and protection of life and the environment, with dialogue, with reconciliation, with the understanding of opposing points of view, with the resolution of differences through peaceful means. These women's values can constitute an alternative to the contemporary culture of violence and form the basis for a new political culture and a more just and prosperous society for all. It is therefore necessary for the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce into the new Treaty the principle of gender balance in the composition of all institutional bodies of the European Union, as well as in all democratic institutions and in the political decision-making bodies of all Member States. Mr. President, why should women enjoy their proportional share in the political decision-making process? And how should we achieve this? As to whether they should and why they should, we can quickly reach an agreement. It is a requirement of simple justice and democracy and, therefore, a criterion of political legitimacy. However, when we have to answer the question of how, our opinions clash. Are information activities, education, and the establishment of practical requirements sufficient, or should we apply preferential treatment, such as quotas on the electoral lists of political parties? Should the state, and therefore the legislative branch, impose such measures on political parties? Or should we even consider a system that reserves 50% of seats for women in elected bodies? This debate, which in some parts of Europe and here too is followed by the French rallying cry of parité, is essentially about the foundation of democracy itself and the political significance we want to give to being a woman."	es
"This is undoubtedly the result of a complex negotiation in which both parties made substantial concessions, which is true for the European Union, particularly in the areas of good governance and trade. But it is above all the result of a strengthening of the ACP group, which has clearly found a new soul after Seattle. I would like to emphasize that a new way of approaching these issues seems to me to be emerging, particularly in the area of trade. We must adopt an approach in this area. Finally, we must go further in policies to support the development of developing countries. On the financial and budgetary levels, in terms of debt, support for sensitive sectors such as food and humanitarian security or education and health, as well as in the areas of the environment, investment or access to information and new technologies, as in the area of trade, while simultaneously ensuring perfect coherence of development policies with other Community policies and also between them and those implemented by the Member States. We cannot simply continue with something that has proven insufficient and wrong in the past. Mr President, after listening to the Council and the Commission today, I absolutely must reread the agenda I have. It normally refers to ""the coherence of the various Union policies with development policy."" However, we have not heard a single word on this subject; I find that very distressing. We have been waiting years for a report on coherence. It should have been available in writing today, but after hearing Mr Nielson's speech, I can easily imagine that he is facing very powerful opposing forces within the Commission. I am aware that the Commissioner has particularly strong and very considered views on coherence, and I would have liked to hear them today. Since the joint motion for a resolution proposes a number of effective mechanisms to ensure consistency, I will, given the very short speaking time I have been given, limit myself to mentioning one more, namely that the Commission should also carry out an evaluation of the relevant new legislation in this area. I would particularly like to highlight the catastrophic consequences that the EU's common agricultural policy has for developing countries. I believe we are all familiar with examples: dumping of beef in the Sahel and South Africa, of tomato puree in West Africa, of milk powder in Jamaica. These are things that the affected producers in the ACP countries know inside out – they who have to destroy their own products in order to compete with subsidised EU products. The contribution of European taxpayers to support European agriculture amounts to EUR 40 billion annually. This money contributes to hindering the development of the agricultural sector in developing countries where agriculture represents 69% of the total workforce compared to 1.7% in the EU."	fr
"This does not mean that we sympathize with Haider. The CSU MEPs have not the slightest sympathy for Haider, the leader of the FPÖ. As politicians, we must rather ask ourselves why 27% of the Austrian population voted for a party like the FPÖ in the October 1999 elections. We must debate the reasons behind this and try to combat the reasons that lead to such results. Only by debating the arguments and policies of the FPÖ can the radicalization of politics in Austria be prevented. In contrast, the European Parliament's resolution does not in any way question the basis of the Austrian election result and does not put forward any potential solutions. For these reasons, the CSU European Group opposes this resolution. ""For he knew what this joyful crowd ignored, and which one can read in books, that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears, that it can remain dormant for decades in furniture and linen, that it waits patiently in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, handkerchiefs and papers, and that, perhaps, the day would come when, to the misfortune and the lesson of men, the plague would awaken its rats and send them to die in a happy city."" It is with these sentences that Albert Camus, at the end of a long allegorical story describing the difficult fight of the inhabitants of Oran against the plague, reminds us, at the end of the Second World War, that the fight against Nazism, ""the brown plague"" as it was then called, could not involve a definitive victory. That racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear, and the rejection of difference, because they are rooted in the most sordid aspects of humanity, can resurface at any time and dominate any human group. It is in this sense that the events we are witnessing in Austria must be considered tragic. For the first time since the Second World War, an openly pro-Nazi, racist, and xenophobic party is on the threshold of power in a European country. Faced with this threat, which carries within it the negation of the very idea at the heart of European integration, nothing should count: neither legal quibbles over what the treaty allows or does not allow, nor legitimate questions about the right to interfere, nor the paltry respect for formal democracy, and especially not the feeling of helplessness that grips us in the face of an event that we reject with all the strength of our convictions, but over which we cannot control. Elected from a French overseas department, Réunion, a land of crossbreeding and mixing, whose population has been forged over the last three centuries by the successive arrival of Europeans, Black people from Africa or Madagascar, indentured laborers from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, I experience every day the profound truth of Saint-Exupéry's words: ""If you differ from me, my brother, far from harming me, you enrich me!"""	fr
"The objective of this proposed regulation is to establish the first implementation program for the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta, starting in 2000 and for a period of five years (2000-2004). The proposal therefore aims to facilitate legislative approximation to the Community acquis and the correct implementation of that acquis. This is a new step within the framework of the Helsinki European Council held last December. At that Council, in view of the progress made by Malta, it was decided to open bilateral conferences starting in February 2000, that is, before the end of the month, in order to begin negotiations on the conditions for accession to the European Union and on the necessary adjustments that must be made. With regard to Cyprus, while the Council confirmed ""that a political solution will facilitate Cyprus's accession to the European Union,"" ""this does not, however, constitute a precondition for its decision on accession,"" and I welcome this. Indeed, I have always considered the approach of making the start of negotiations with Cyprus conditional on the search for a solution to the situation affecting the third part of the territory of this Republic, occupied by Turkey, to be totally unfair. In general, it is true that the socioeconomic situation of these two countries is much more favorable than that of other candidate countries. However, they have been able to benefit from technical and financial assistance from the European Union for the transposition of the Community acquis. This technical and financial assistance was provided until the end of 1999, within the framework of the four financial protocols (B7-4011). Both countries are also beneficiaries of financial assistance from the MEDA program (B7-4012). In its first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament emphasized that the new heading ""pre-accession"" (B7-0) proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget should not be limited to the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe, since it should also include Malta and Cyprus. However, given the Council's refusal to negotiate the necessary revision of the ceiling of Heading 7 (pre-accession) of the Financial Perspective, the European Parliament agreed, on an exceptional basis—I would like to emphasize this fact—to finance the corresponding expenditure from Heading 4 (external measures) of the Financial Perspective for the year 2000. At the same time, the European Parliament created a new chapter on the ""pre-accession strategy for the Mediterranean countries"" (B7-04). Within this chapter, two new articles were created on the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus, pending the Commission's presentation, in accordance with the Helsinki European Council, of the legal bases and the revision of the ceiling of Heading 7 of the Financial Perspective. This proposal for a regulation should constitute one of these legal bases! (EN) I welcome Mr. Brok's report, which strengthens with amendments the Commission's proposals aimed at preparing Cyprus and Malta for European Union membership. The package will allocate a total of around EUR 15 million to both countries this year. It is regrettable, however, that the Commission has avoided multinational funding and has instead decided to allocate funds on an annual basis."	es
The melody that will be played will be one that the citizens of Europe listen to, and they will want to hear the right one. As it was described this afternoon, it will go a long way toward making us forget the unpleasant melodies we heard at the time of the European elections and over the past few months. The Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere Council are developing the project for an area of freedom, security, and justice. There is one aspect, however, that is extremely important and in which this Parliament must participate: scrutiny. There is so much legislation—and I take this opportunity to congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on its programme presented to us last week—that we must have absolute certainty that it is being followed closely, that the Members of the European Parliament, the Members of the national parliaments, and the citizens of Europe are aware of all that it entails. Furthermore, we must ensure that it is, in all its details, applicable, appropriate, and useful to each of the different countries. I would like to draw attention to certain aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon, one or two of which have already been mentioned. I welcome the move towards recognition of judicial systems between different countries and cooperation in criminal matters. The citizens of Europe will not be indifferent to this and they will be pleased by it. However, the Commission and the Council should be aware that many Members of this House have reservations, for example, about the Eurodac system. We recognize the Council's leading role in this matter, but reservations exist, and I am sure that the Council will be keen to listen to what the elected Members present here have to say when the subject is discussed in more detail. Mr. Schulz said that he was not sure how to define the word scoreboard. Every Englishman or Briton, or anyone who follows a cricket match, knows what a scoreboard is. The scoreboard, or scoreboard, tells the spectators the score of the match; It must follow developments, it must be very clear and very visible. I have no doubt that Commissioner Vitorino will ensure that this is the case. I hope that at the end of the six months, the music will still be playing and that citizens will still be listening. Mr President, allow me to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Ministry of Justice, Mr Costa. I would like to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee last week in Lisbon and for the constructive meetings we had. Amsterdam and Tampere gave us a lot of work to do together, as Mrs Terrón's excellent draft resolution today shows. I would like to make three fairly brief points. The first is that it is time we had a considered dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament. It has been just six months since the Treaty of Amsterdam required our two organisations to work hand in hand: we have sized each other up, we have had a few minor spats, but now it is time to actually work together.	fr
"Since the adoption of Directive 86/611, the investment fund sector has continued to evolve, requiring current regulations to be modernized. The new proposals aim to ensure the highest level of investor protection, a conditio sine qua non for market integration following the introduction of the euro. Given that an average European family allocates its savings to investment funds, the proposals contain provisions relating to prudent management—I want to emphasize this—prudent management in terms of investment policy and risk diversification. Both proposals constitute a unified whole. The first expands the range of instruments in which an ""undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities"" (UCITS) can invest. As has already been pointed out in this session, UCITS are one of the most important players in modern capital markets. Thanks to their presence, the number of non-professional investors able to participate in these markets has been increasing, without prejudice to the principle of risk-sharing and appropriate supervision. Since the possibility of opting for diversified investment options is provided, individual investors can benefit from all the advantages offered by new investment techniques. The second proposal expands the role that these important intermediary bodies can play in the European Union's capital markets with regard to the development of the investment fund sector. Since it is now possible to create branches and provide certain cross-border services, these bodies can finally make use of the freedoms enshrined in the Treaty of Rome that have been denied to them for all these years. The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and will adopt many of its ideas. More specifically, the Commission will adopt—and I am now using the most recent numbering—Amendments 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19, and 21 with regard to the first proposal and Amendments 23, 28, and 32 with regard to the second proposal, as these are clearly useful clarifications and improvements. Furthermore, I value the ideas expressed in Amendments 1, 10, 11, 14, 18, and 20, although they will need to be reformulated. I also agree with the underlying idea of limiting counterparty risk to a maximum percentage, as set out in Amendments 17, 36, and 45. I can similarly accept the content of the second paragraph of Amendment 47. All the amendments I have just mentioned relate to the first proposal. Regarding the second proposal, we can adopt the ideas expressed in Amendments 24, 25, 29, 30, 41, and parts of Amendment 27, as they contain sensible suggestions, provided their wording is adapted. In other words, the Commission is willing to adopt their content but proposes modifying their wording. Furthermore, I note the request from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to prepare a codification of the full text once it has been adopted. This request is reflected in Amendments 7 and 22 to the first and second proposals, respectively."	es
By undertaking such an innovation in our organization, I am confident that we will be able to match—or even surpass—the success and increased employee motivation resulting from similar innovations in various public and private sector administrations over the past decade or so. I believe that the end of the centralized system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control, but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks. Financial control will be absolutely guaranteed by the way we will introduce the changes and because we will introduce a fully independent and fully professional internal audit service. As I said before, our ambition is to maximize the value of our money without any loss of security. We are also interested in the value for the people who work for us. Changes in financial management and control will greatly increase the possibility of doing all of this. I also thank—at the risk of being repetitive—Ms. Theato for the constant attention she has paid to these matters and for truly acting—if I may put it that way—as a midwife for many of the changes whose possible implementation we are examining. I hope she will come to feel proud of the offspring she has at least partly engendered. First of all, I am not sure that what I heard from the interpreter is correct, as it does not seem possible to me that someone as expert as Ms. Theato could speak of the abolition of independent financial control. Obviously, the Financial Regulation grants a certain degree of independence to the current Auditor. However, given the mix of financial management, control, and audit roles in the current mandate, it is very difficult to consider it an inflexible role, no matter how great the integrity of the person occupying it. So the changes we intend to make—in line, as I say, with the strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts—are not in any way negative. Coherence, consistency, and universally valid standards in a decentralized system of financial control are guaranteed by a number of measures. One is to ensure the highest quality training; another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can assume powers in matters of financial control unless—and until—the audit service is absolutely certain of the soundness of the system; another is the creation of a central financial service, as you will see in the White Paper, to ensure the establishment and supervision of such standards; and there is also, for greater certainty, the precautionary approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service. I will not go into all the details in an answer to a parliamentary question of this kind, but I am sure that, after examining it, Mrs. Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very solid guarantees. There will also be evidence that we have taken into account the protests expressed in this Assembly, particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, which is important in relation to the use of ex ante approvals in the Directorates-General.	es
Second, we must see what each country's capabilities are so that this overall force of 60,000 troops can be distributed in an orderly and efficient manner among the fifteen countries. Third, we must see what the differences are between the Headline Goal and what each country can contribute. It is possible, ladies and gentlemen, that we do not have enough capabilities in the fifteen countries and that they will all have to make an additional effort to meet the needs we have proposed. How are we going to do this? We want to do this by convening a conference of the fifteen countries to see what differences remain between the objectives set and the means at our disposal to achieve them and to see how what we lack is distributed among the fifteen countries that form the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, we want to set the timetable so that, during the French Presidency, in December 2000, we can conclude this process with a major conference generating forces from all countries so that needs and capabilities are equivalent and so that we can therefore sincerely say that we already have the plan for what we must do from the end of 2000 to 2003, the date at which we have decided that the capabilities will be in operation. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what we are doing, this is what we are committed to. I believe that we have worked well in these last months, these last weeks, and I think that we will be able to work during the remainder of the year 2000 during the Portuguese Presidency - which is truly doing an extraordinary, magnificent job - and continue during the French Presidency, which, without a doubt, will continue to work with the same promptness and capacity that it has shown on other occasions. I wanted to tell you that in the meantime, there will be at least four European Councils: Lisbon, Feria, and two European Councils during the French Presidency. At these Councils, the Heads of State and Government are also willing to continue examining these issues so that we do not miss the boat and are in a position, by 2003, to implement what we have agreed upon, if necessary. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, I believe that in this area we are working with determination, with energy, and with the broad support of all governments and all Heads of State and Government. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add two more things. The European Union has an obligation to carry out this entire operation while maintaining contact with the third countries to which I referred, countries which, although geographically members of Europe, are not yet part of the European Union. These are countries with which we must work, with which we must integrate because, if a crisis arises, God forbid, all forces and all countries will be more than welcome. Then, we must be able to establish a fluid and transparent relationship with NATO. The operations that we will have to carry out in the future will be of three types: the first resumes operations in which European forces participate within the framework of NATO; the second resumes operations in which European forces participate and are led, but using NATO assets and infrastructure; the third resumes operations in which Europeans will act alone.	fr
Deeply concerned by the continuing human rights violations in Tibet and with a view to supporting the Dalai Lama's proposal to establish a dialogue with the Chinese Government with a view to resolving the Tibetan situation, the Inter-Group Working Group on Tibet therefore calls on the Commission to appoint a Delegate for Tibetan Affairs, who will deal, within the framework of the European Union, with issues relating to that country and who will endeavour to bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities or their representatives into dialogue. When does the Commission intend to appoint this Delegate for Tibetan Affairs? I call Mr Patten, on behalf of the Commission. The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared. I have long believed in the need to firmly and sincerely present our views on human rights, including in Tibet, to the Chinese authorities. This is what the European Union did last month at the EU-China summit in Beijing, where we lobbied the Chinese on a range of human rights issues, including in Tibet. Once again, we invited the Chinese to enter into a dialogue with the Dalai Lama. Once again, I invite the Chinese to do so. We will continue to raise the issue of Tibet with the Chinese authorities. We are also taking other actions: during the EU-China human rights dialogue, we emphasized a range of practical measures, including sending experts on missions to Tibet, planning development aid programs, and activities related to health, education, and training for Tibetans. The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would primarily rest with the Council, and the European Parliament could raise the issue directly with him. As far as I am concerned, I am not sure that our efforts would gain much from this in practical terms. It is unlikely that it will have a great impact on the Chinese authorities, and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile. I would also like to avoid an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, however laudable the cause. Mr. President, Mr. Patten, you obviously have excellent experience of China because of your background, and you are certainly aware of the efforts the Tibetans are making to establish dialogues, all of which have been avoided so far. If your response is limited to telling us to contact Mr. CFSP, Mr. Solana, I fear that this is a one-sided orientation in foreign policy. Your approach, which I readily advocate for its consistency, is inspired by the theme of human rights. I completely agree: we must address the issue of human rights. Detention, torture, the mutilation of young women and other similar practices are all topics for completely interminable discussions. If we reduce all this to saying that the Council is competent in these matters, I fear that human rights issues will not come sufficiently to the fore. The possibility of emphasizing, on the one hand, the economy and trade while including the issue of human rights would be a measure for which we would actually rely on the partnership of the European Commission and not say that it is the Council's business.	fr
I therefore support Mr Swoboda's well-founded report – we are used to nothing less from him – and hence also my words of praise for the respectable Republic of Macedonia. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me first to express my personal appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, for the quality of his work. Today, we are issuing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia. We do so in the awareness that this decision, the first ever relating to this region, is concretely embedded in an entirely new phase in our relations with the Balkans. It is itself a factor in this new phase, or rather, a policy that sees the future integration of this region into the European Union as the only possibility for a peaceful solution to its conflicts. Our agreement to the negotiations, as proposed in the rapporteur's explanatory memorandum, is based on our conviction that it is right to combine, in Union policy, both a regional dimension and specific recognition of the efforts and achievements of each Member State in aligning itself with the acquis communautaire. I believe that this dual objective must be pursued. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to support programmes relating, for example, to infrastructure, to prepare the creation of a free trade area – for which it is still too early – and to promote forms of economic and commercial cooperation between the Balkan countries. On the other hand, it is inadvisable to create a model for a closer integration policy with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at this stage. Moreover, for a number of reasons, we cannot help but adopt a positive opinion. As we observed during our missions to Skopje, in the former Republic of Yugoslavia, considerable progress has been made in the economic sphere, on the road to democracy, and in the area of interethnic coexistence – a rather difficult and conflict-ridden area in the Balkans. On the other hand, the war in neighboring Kosovo has taken a heavy toll there, both in terms of the provision of logistics for NATO forces and in declining exports to Northern Europe. In conclusion, I would like to stress that these developments are undoubtedly difficult, fluid, and uncertain, and that they require constant vigilance on our part at the various stages, which must be reflected in regular, targeted checks. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to express the enthusiastic and optimistic welcome given to the opening of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia by the Group of Liberals, Democrats and Reformists for Europe. I sincerely hope that this agreement, in the broad lines outlined by the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, will serve as an example and be extended as soon as possible to other countries, in particular Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and, as soon as possible, to Serbia. We are convinced that the rapid initiation and swift conclusion of these negotiations is the only way to bring about peace in the region – the peace that has not been automatic since the end of the war in Kosovo – and thus to prevent the conditions for further disintegration from arising again and the resumption of chaos and violence, leading to instability in Europe, if not the world.	de
The public's acceptance of such prices without panicking about financial transactions can be explained by overly optimistic expectations of future profits. Speculative activities are growing beyond all bounds and, in turn, fueling profits that will one day prove to be fictitious. Excessive optimism will be followed by disillusionment and fear, resulting in a stock market crash and, possibly, an economic crisis. The risk is too great to ignore. We must face it, however difficult it may seem. Modern economics has provided us with a remarkable tool in the proposal by Tobin and others, which we could use if we had the political will to start acting. That is what we lack, Commissioner: the political will to start tackling speculation. But blissful admiration or resignation in the face of market forces, the professions of faith of the liberals - and I regret that Mr. Gasòliba i Böhm is no longer among us - cannot continue to characterize democracy indefinitely, because they are leading us straight to catastrophe! Madam President, Mr. Bolkestein, it is quite incredible to see the extent to which ignorance permeates this discussion. It took a Greek colleague to finally tell us what this Tobin tax meant. You reject it out of hand because you understand nothing about it. It is perfectly clear that the right is opposed to taxes; otherwise, it would never have dared to transfer these millions, even billions, to Switzerland. This has become clear. Now, I call on you - in full knowledge of the facts - to help stop speculative financial capital, to finally support long-term projects with long-term capital. This has never been done in Southeast Asia, it has never been done in Europe, and, considering their financial management, I can understand why our Austrian colleague Karas is no longer here. It's the same mess. We need a Tobin tax to be able to intervene via a fiscal instrument. Madam President, I am revolted by the political ignorance of this Commission, that is, Commissioner Bolkestein. Given his position on the Tobin tax, he should really ask himself why he is here. Madam President, I too had a bit of the impression of a ghostly debate. It is probably no coincidence that no conservatives are present anymore, because the idea of free markets that they defended no longer has anything to do with the august principles of the social market economy that have brought so much prosperity to Western Europe in recent decades. If we continue to assert the sacrosanct nature of markets—such is the ideology—and even to maintain that any intervention in the functioning of these markets is opposed to progress and economic growth, we are most certainly on the wrong track and this could take on very dangerous proportions. At present, capital holders are still amassing colossal fortunes that need to be reinvested.	fr
"I condemn the false arguments with which both sides have attempted to mislead Members and the public in the context of this difficult and, in some cases, highly technical issue. I therefore particularly appreciate the interventions of my group colleagues, who helped make some compromises possible. Above all, I would like to express my special gratitude for the tremendous work done by our rapporteur, Mrs. Lienemann, and for her cooperative attitude, even though disagreements still exist on some points. I would also like to express my gratitude to the representatives of the European Commission, who have always been available to advise us and offer technical assistance. If the representatives of the Council of Ministers adopt the same constructive attitude, I have no doubt that, in the conciliation procedure, we will all succeed in reaching an even more appropriate solution for the protection of Europe's aquatic environment. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Ms. Lienemann for the excellent work she has presented and for the effort she has made to bridge the gaps that separate us on the issue of water. The Water Framework Directive is a necessary initiative. However, and given that the idea of solidarity is intrinsic to the process of European integration, this directive must take into account that water resources must be understood as a factor of social cohesion. Water—no one doubts this—is a good of general interest. However, in the case of Spain and other southern countries, which have irregular climates, the management of water resources requires political approaches to rationalize their use and other solidarity-based measures. Therefore, we believe that this Framework Directive should advocate for the use of water that overcomes territorial imbalances, and, to this end, I request your support for Amendment 95, presented by our Group. We want to ensure that Article 1 of the Directive promotes the sustainable, efficient, fair, and equitable use of water. I will now briefly review the main issues on which the Spanish Socialist delegation maintains some divergence from certain positions defended here. This is the case with water transfers. We would prefer that the future Framework Directive not leave the possibility of implementing them subject to Community supervision. We believe that, given the hydrographic characteristics of the Spanish State, where structural water transfers are carried out, it should be the country's authorities who decide on the resources of their own territory, a decision that, of course, should always be made based on the criteria of seeking cohesion and the rational use of water. Regarding one of the most controversial points of our debate, that of pricing, the Spanish Socialists have been advocating that, while respecting the ""polluter pays"" principle, the Directive should advocate affordable pricing policies for all consumption levels. It is clear that in Spain, a full water cost recovery policy would not have the same impact as in Central and Northern European countries. Spaniards would see the price of water rise for its various uses, precisely due to the scarcity of water resources and the internalization of environmental costs that will be necessary within the framework of the Directive."	es
I spoke about the extraordinary European Council and Portugal's intention to hold it; I spoke about it from a future perspective, because there are two complementary ways of addressing the issue of social exclusion: one is the set of measures to be adopted immediately in order to combat its concrete effects, the second is the creation of conditions of competitiveness at international level that allow us to improve the economic fabric within the Union with positive consequences on the problems of social exclusion. However, the Portuguese Presidency does not have miracle recipes to respond in six months to issues that have always been ongoing. There is a willingness to work in these areas, on the proposal of the Commission, in all areas of Community competence and of course it is possible - and it is in our interest - to encourage as a whole the initiatives that will be presented, in particular, by non-governmental organizations, but also thanks to the traditional intergovernmental coordination in these areas. However, it must be borne in mind, Honourable Member, that it is not possible to operate in an area with such a large financial impact solely and exclusively through measures proposed by a Presidency in office for only six months. For this reason, we believe that only measures envisaged as part of long-term strategies - although we know, it is true, that in the long term some homeless people may have died - will allow us to launch sustainable policies at European Union level. And it is to these strategies that we will try to contribute in the best possible way during our six-month term. Question No 12, by the Honourable Member (H-0801/99): Subject: Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy, the Lomé Convention and the way of dealing with famine situations? I would like to thank the Presidency for the comprehensive answer given to my question, and in particular the Minister who spoke in the Committee on Development last week in Brussels to explain the issue. However, there are still some problems to be resolved. There does not seem to have been any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme. The AIDS situation in Africa has become so serious that more people die from this disease than in conflicts. I hope that the Minister will devote some time to this particular issue. There are drugs available in the United States, but the price charged does not make them accessible to the people of Africa. I would like to ask the Minister what exactly he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia, where there is drought, the harvests have failed and where in six months we will inevitably return to the situation that existed a few years ago, characterised by famine and the deaths of thousands of people. At the same time, there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the European arms industry is sending its weapons, after which we will send bread. Honourable Member, first of all I would like to make it clear to you that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague's speech at the meeting of the Committee on Development and Cooperation.	it
"Duration of the regulation: In order to avoid a conciliation procedure, the Commission rejects Amendment 12 and its proposal for an unlimited period of validity for the regulations. In our view, the seven-year period proposed by the Council is an acceptable compromise. Bank guarantees: For the reasons already stated, the Commission rejects Amendment 8 on bank guarantees. We reject specific provisions in certain budget lines because this runs counter to our common objective of simplifying and standardizing our administrative procedures. Furthermore, following a decision taken by the Commission in 1999, we consider that this issue has essentially been settled. With regard to the other amendments, our position is as follows: The Commission welcomes and supports Amendments 7 and 10. We can also accept Amendment 4. We reject Amendments 2, 3, and 6 because we believe that the underlying concepts have already been taken into account elsewhere in the regulation following first reading. In the interest of clear and concise legislation, we should refrain from proposing these amendments. Amendment 1 is not supported because, in our view, it adds little of significance. Given the Council's negative opinion on this amendment, the Commission also advocates its deletion. Finally, we reject Amendment 5 because we consider the phrase ""serious doubts"" to be too subjective and fear that it could make implementation of the regulation very difficult. Furthermore, the objective of this amendment—namely, the prevention of projects with negative social, cultural, or economic impacts, as well as negative environmental consequences—is already addressed in Article 4(5) on impact assessments. Thank you, Commissioner Nielson! The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00 noon. Ship-generated waste and cargo residues. Now, Mr Jarzembowski, here comes the moment of glory! The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0043/2000) by Mr Bouwman, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues. Mr President, Commissioner, we are debating a directive today that is necessary, indeed desperately needed. In recent weeks, we have discussed the Erika accident. This also included proposals for various new, short-term measures, such as double-hulled hulls, controls, supervision by inspection bodies, and so on. The total oil pollution of the sea caused by such disasters amounts to around 3%. Twice that percentage is attributable to normal shipping operations. But that's not all. In the Netherlands, for example, and in other countries too, 49% of the waste on our beaches is washed up directly from the sea. Tourists account for only 15%, while a large proportion are of unknown and cannot be precisely located. Given the enormous economic damage, the deterioration of habitats vital to seabirds, fish, and other living creatures—in short, given that our environment is at stake—this directive is urgently needed. I need say nothing more about the reasons for this directive."	de
Added to this is the lack of transparency. Everything is being done to conceal the chain of responsibility, the identity of the owners, and the true decision-makers as much as possible. This is no longer acceptable. We must achieve real and significant changes in all these areas, including setting a deadline for the new standards, which include the double hull, failing which, in turn, will result in a ban on docking in ports or sailing in the territorial waters of the Member States. Furthermore, we must ensure more rigorous procedures for issuing seaworthiness certificates and monitoring the condition and maintenance of ships. Finally, we must ensure that, in the event of a disaster, all those responsible are held accountable for compensation. In this case, I am thinking in particular of the Total-Fina group. The European Union can put forward the same ideas to the International Maritime Organization. This would demonstrate its worth in the eyes of a public that, this time, expects clear and concrete action. Mr President, Commissioner, As a Member of Parliament from the Vendée department on the French Atlantic coast, I would first like to express the indignation felt by the population affected by the Erika oil spill at the devastating consequences, caused not by a natural disaster like the hurricane that also hit us, but by a crime. In this hour of need, there was a wonderful outpouring of solidarity: at the local, national, and transnational levels. Now, the population affected, those who have lost everything, particularly those professionals who make their living from the sea and tourism and whose activities are in jeopardy for years to come, expect not only that those responsible for the damage make good, but also that everything possible is done to learn from their current misfortune so that others do not become victims of similar crimes tomorrow. We are now paying the price for our omissions. Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, no longer considered it useful to maintain their own merchant fleets and allowed valuable shipbuilding expertise to be lost, we no longer have clear ship traceability and are forced to watch as our waters are plied by dilapidated vessels flying flags of convenience, serving the short-term interests of multinational corporations. This chain of irresponsibility, from irresponsible charterers to untraceable shipowners to compliant certification bodies, must be brought to an end. We are in a difficult situation today. These matters obviously need to be regulated globally, but the current IMO rules are woefully inadequate and far too lax, and despite previous disasters, neither our countries nor the Community have seriously attempted to make them stricter. Certainly, there is the International Fund for the Protection of the Environment from Petroleum Pollution (FIPOL), but it blurs the lines of responsibility, and the fund's ceiling on compensation is completely inadequate and urgently needs to be changed. The issue of flags of convenience must be reexamined within the IMO. It is up to the Member States and the Community to take the initiative in this regard. Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under the flag of convenience of a state that is a candidate for EU accession.	de
If these funds help to eliminate the backlogs of regions, cities, and population groups, or if health and the environment are improved, my group is satisfied. It is a matter of solidarity and progress. But the fact that ever more money is allocated does not guarantee that spending will improve accordingly. The cities and regions that benefit from the funds have meanwhile gained experience on the ground. They find it extremely difficult to spend the money on the objectives for which they need it most. The results are generally good when it comes to economic growth and infrastructure, but social objectives and the environment are not always approved. Because there is great uncertainty about how the rules are laid out, municipalities and regions spend fortunes hiring the services of expert offices to assess the extent to which European Commission officials are willing to approve their plans. In some cases, I have the impression that it is not about solidarity or solving the most pressing problems, but about maintaining interests and propaganda in favor of the benefits of the European Union. It seems that the main objective now is to build and paint a propaganda billboard stating that the project in question is co-financed by the European Union. Far too much money is wasted on propaganda and consulting firms, on consultation and control, and far too much money is returning to the country from which it came. After the accession of the new Member States, with their 100 million inhabitants whose standard of living is one-third or two-thirds of the average in the current Member States of the European Union, this waste will arouse even more objections. In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the United Left Group agreed with the rapporteur for the opinion on Leader, Mr Nogueira Román. He rightly noted that it is not a good idea to spread these funds across all rural areas. Between innovation projects and concentrating funds on combating backwardness, we opt for the latter objective because it contributes more to equality. Innovation in regions where things are already going well is already profitable and is taking place, even without European contributions. A second point to be aware of is the abuse of power and cronyism that regional and municipal administrations can be guilty of. The focus is on local groups in which authorities, non-profit organizations, and for-profit companies cooperate. The discussion focused on the distribution key to be used. In particular, a variant reminiscent of the Dutch polder model, organized structural cooperation between authorities, unions, and entrepreneurs, was discussed. Let us not forget that elections to municipal councils and regional parliaments are intended to represent the entire population. In fact, it would be a matter of these bodies carrying out an examination and taking into account the wishes of sectoral organisations and environmental movements.	fr
It is in this spirit, almost provocatively, that we have tabled an amendment suggesting the transfer of competences for South-East Europe from foreign affairs to enlargement. The more rapid and direct involvement of South-East Europe in the life of the European institutions has led us to also suggest that a limited number of observers be accepted, sent by national parliaments to the European Parliament, and that staff from those countries be allowed to work at the Court of Justice and the Commission. However, to encourage the evolution of the region towards a more democratic and market-based society, we are above all convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the fight against corruption and to make international aid for reconstruction and development more efficient. That is why we have tabled some amendments, which I hope Parliament will accept: first, to offer the former Republic of Macedonia a zero customs tariff for its exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia on European products, provided that the principle of joint customs control at Macedonia's borders is accepted; second, that the former Republic of Macedonia be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to progressively link its currency to the euro as a first step towards a Europeanisation of the entire Macedonian economy, and this with the further aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system; third, that the aid and assistance that the world must give to the region, and therefore also to Macedonia, have a marked multilateral character, without conditioning the recipient country to direct obligations towards the donor country. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we hope that the agreement will achieve all the goals it sets itself, but we cannot delude ourselves that peace, stability and prosperity in south-eastern Europe can be achieved without addressing issues of much broader problems, which we are trying to remove: I am referring to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, the need to involve Serbia in the reconciliation process in the region and - why not? - the renegotiation of relations between the European Union, NATO and the UN, in the light of the new balance to be found between humanitarian interference and state sovereignty, which I believe will have to change the UN Charter itself. Mr President, Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has created a climate of great instability. This instability is a particular feature of relations between the European Union and the Western Balkans. Since then, expectations have been particularly high, both in that region and in our countries. In that region because, whether we like it or not, beyond the request for direct aid, the question that arises is: what does Europe intend to do with us? Is there a possibility of accession? These are very heartfelt questions in all the countries in question. Expectations are also high here, in the European Union. If we act correctly, this could be the first proof of the existence of a real common foreign and security policy.	it
"Therefore, following the incorporation of Declaration No 31 into the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union institutions undertook extensive negotiations and consultations, which ultimately culminated in the new Council Decision, which, although it amends the old system in substantial ways, does not, in our view, satisfy the requirements. In particular, the Decision introduces a rudimentary right of scrutiny for Parliament, that is, the possibility of 'ringing the alarm' when a measure implementing an act adopted under the codecision procedure infringes the implementing powers conferred on the Commission. During the lengthy interinstitutional negotiations, in which Parliament was actively involved thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Adelaide Aglietta, the aim was for the European Parliament and the Commission to conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the modalities for implementing certain aspects of the new Decision. This was done, firstly, to clarify certain points which the Council was not prepared to include in the decision, and secondly, to regulate the information and control system with regard to implementing measures more precisely. During the trialogue on 6 October 1999 in Strasbourg, the Presidents of the European Parliament and the Commission approved the proposal to conclude this agreement swiftly. We believe that we have fulfilled this obligation, which was relatively easy for us, given that a climate of trust and mutual respect prevailed throughout the negotiations with the Commission. The agreement essentially deals with two points. Firstly, the information of the European Parliament, as a conditio sine qua non for the effective exercise of its right of intervention under Article 8 of the decision. To date, this information has been provided on paper and in an unsystematic manner, and has often been unusable for our services, partly through the fault of Parliament itself. From now on, this information will be ensured by an electronic system called CIRCA, to which the European Parliament has access, and which represents a real innovation not only for us but also—I am sure—for the Commission. Secondly, Article 8 of the Council Decision does not specify the procedure or the deadline within which the European Parliament must ""ring the alarm bell,"" that is, exercise its limited powers of scrutiny. Points 6 and 7 of the agreement stipulate that the European Parliament will generally adopt its reasoned resolution in plenary and will have one month to exercise its right of intervention before the Commission adopts the draft implementing measure. However, we are all aware that it is not always possible to wait a month before adopting an implementing measure. Therefore, the agreement expressly provides for an urgency procedure within which the committee responsible can intervene. Finally, I would like to stress that we must wait and see how the agreement works in practice before we can judge whether it is a good agreement or not. The European Parliament will have to equip itself with tools it does not currently have to ensure efficient implementation procedures and effective oversight, and the Commission will have to accept a reorganization of some of its procedures to ensure effective oversight and genuine information to Parliament."	de
"There is no clear consensus within the People's Party group on the issue of supporting mandatory quotas. Some members even oppose them. Personally, I don't want to feel like a quota; I don't want to think that I'm in a certain position only because I was born a woman. This is a feeling men will never have, and a fundamental difference. I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their contributions, and I agree with the latter that it's time for fine words to be translated into action. We all know how small the representation of women is in decision-making at all levels; we know the statistics, and they speak volumes. I agree that accurate statistics are also necessary, because we will only know that we are slowly overcoming the problems by seeing the numbers change. With systematic monitoring, we will be able to identify this. Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment. In the meantime, we need positive action, which means applying quotas and similar measures. We can learn from the successes mentioned, not only by looking at the actual number of elected female representatives, but also at the impact they had on the composition of government, to demonstrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system. I am pleased that the proportion of women in the National Assembly in Wales, which I represent, is 40%. This is the result of positive action by the political parties; on the other hand, there are only four women from Wales in the House of Commons, which amounts to just 10% of all representatives. Therefore, statements of principle and support in principle are not enough, as they do not work. If we have faith in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision-making structures, we ourselves must participate in the measures necessary to implement it. Mr. President, at the Second International Socialist Women's Conference in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided to link the main demand, women's suffrage, to the entire women's question. Furthermore, as stated in the resolution, ""Women's Day should be given an international character and be well prepared."" It is also noteworthy that Women's Day was subsequently banned in all countries where fascism and racism came to power, as well as between the wars. In 1910, women's suffrage was on the agenda. Today, we are focused on increasing women's participation in decision-making. Women are not a homogeneous group. They belong to different social classes and have different individual needs and interests. However, the general and consistent rule is that, regardless of where we are, regardless of class, race, or religion, whether at home or at work, we are subordinate to men in all areas of society—with few individual exceptions, it should probably be added. In my home country, Sweden, several political parties have voluntarily introduced quotas for election to political bodies and for holding political office in recent years. This has led to an increasing number of women in political decision-making, which in turn has opened up new opportunities for research."	de
"In September, we committed to carrying out reform with the presentation of the White Paper, and today we are fulfilling that commitment, in the terms we have made to you. The Commission wants to be judged by the facts, only by the facts, on the basis of what we are going to achieve. However, I remind you—this is my final reflection—that the Commission is not the only Community institution. Parliament and the Council are also called upon to fully accept the challenge of these reforms. The Commission has resolutely paved the way: I hope that all the institutions will follow it to the end, serving European citizens, for an ever stronger and more transparent Europe. I am pleased to be here with President Prodi and my colleague Michele Schreyer to present the White Paper ""Reform of the Commission,"" approved by the Commission this morning. As you will see in the document, which will be available to you today, the unprecedented consultation of Commission staff, this Parliament, and the Council that has taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January has been very productive, and useful improvements have resulted. Along with Romano Prodi, I express my gratitude to this House and to the many people who have dedicated their time and effort to providing us with their constructive responses. The White Paper places reform in its proper political framework. Systems and structures have been created in the Commission over 40 years, during which time there have been successful enlargements. The Treaties have been revised, this Parliament and the Council have assigned the Commission new management tasks, and many other major changes have taken place in our Union, on our continent, and in the world. These realities, together with the prospect of further enlargements, strongly advocate modernizing the Commission so that this essential institution can carry out its primary tasks of policymaking and formulation, implementation of the Treaties, and management of public resources, and do so with maximum effectiveness, responsibility, and democratic accountability. Naturally, the continued independence and strength of the Commission are fundamental to that mission, as this Assembly has repeatedly recognized. Reform and renewal are also essential to that end. The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind, and that is clear to all institutions—that is something that is perfectly understood everywhere. But the Commission exists to serve the Union and its people with high standards of performance. That is what citizens have a right to expect and what the people who work for the Commission want to deliver and will deliver. As the Assembly must, of course, know, the Commission cannot achieve these objectives alone. All institutions of the European Union will have to address the issues raised by reform and do so honestly and responsibly. I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many members of this Assembly from all political parties."	es
A small step, he said, nonetheless welcome, to which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has rightly sought to impose further limits and precautions in the name of defending the fundamental rights of individuals, recognized in the Member States and in the Union itself, even though they are not yet enshrined in a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which we trust will soon be published. These limits and precautions are appropriate because, unfortunately, not all public authorities always specifically respect all the rights in force in all Member States. Perhaps there has been an excess of caution at some specific points in the Commission's proposals, such as when it sought to grant detained defendants the option of consenting to or refusing temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of investigation. Personally, I do not consider it acceptable, for example, to allow Mr. Pinochet to choose whether or not to travel to Spain for a confrontation. Or when it has been intended that the witness or expert—and not just the person under investigation and the accused—may also be assisted by counsel during remote questioning. However, these are minor errors that the rapporteur has unwittingly made, and which the vote of this House will remedy. The rapporteur has made a commendable effort, which must be acknowledged and for which I am grateful. The overall result is appreciable, and I hope the Council will take it seriously. As has been said, one point remains unresolved, the most delicate: it concerns Article 18 of the Convention concerning wiretapping of communications carried out in a Member State and carried out directly by another Member State, without requesting the assistance of the State where the wiretapping takes place, something that is possible today thanks to modern technologies. The issue is highly controversial, as it is a potential source of abuse. It could be argued that the complex regulation proposed is better than nothing, but the Commission found it insufficient and disturbing. Consequently, when the contradictory news about ECHELON evokes the specter of Big Brother, it merits further, and probably more comprehensive, reflection on the means and systems through which, on the one hand, individuals' rights are protected and, on the other, effective, yet correct and legitimate, crime suppression is enabled. The objective, therefore, is to achieve, as far as possible, a delicate balance between effective combating crime and respect for human freedom and dignity. This objective, today, is not only the responsibility of individual States but has become a hallmark of the Union's policy, which aspires to become a common area of freedom, justice, and security. It is a distant goal, but it can be achieved in progressive stages.	es
And, above all, and with this I conclude, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we must be able to express this in plain language, clearly, changing to a certain extent the jargon we use, because we cannot ask Europeans, who are living through times of profound change, to join us and be enthusiastic about us if we continue to maintain a completely closed language and turn our backs on them. This is the fundamental means of increasing and reinforcing the trust that, in any case, I hope can be measured in the upcoming European elections. Mr. President of the Commission, allow me to say, on behalf of my group, that we firmly support the starting point, the core of the analysis and the strategy you are presenting to the House today; namely, that the stakes are now undeniably political. And it is political, because we are making progress. Although we have not yet finished constructing all the basic pieces, we are moving from that kind of functional construction of Europe toward a political perspective that poses a greater challenge. The challenge of enlargement is political. The challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs, of addressing asylum, immigration, and crime, is highly political. The challenge of a common defense and external security policy is highly political. And because it is political, it is more complex. Because it is political, it is more susceptible to sovereignty. Because it is more susceptible to sovereignty, it is more susceptible to voters and citizens. We must therefore find a way to move forward until we achieve these political goals and objectives, to overcome not only skepticism, but also the greatest enemy of all, which is the apathy you mentioned. The means to achieve this are not easy, but they are real. I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions, not only between the Commission and Parliament, but also between them and the Council to highlight the scale of the political challenge. We need more dialogue, not only among ourselves, but also with civil society. More explanation is needed to understand what Europe is all about. We must overcome fears and anxieties, because in many cases, the greatest fear is fear itself. Perhaps with more dialogue and explanations, we can overcome some of these fears. My group is particularly attracted to the creative possibilities you have suggested regarding the prospect of presenting a White Paper next spring, addressing the issue of governance. When we look at the Europe of networks you describe, it is very important that Europe focus on its main themes, that we have the courage to focus on the areas where Europe could fall behind. In this way, we could convince the population that Europe, in its governance, is not something directed exclusively from Brussels, in an attempt to concentrate and absorb more powers, more decisions, and more authority. This is the political core of the challenge, and I believe you have explained it perfectly before this House today. For my group, enlargement is the first priority against which all other possible reforms must be measured, whether governance, the Intergovernmental Conference, or the reform of the institutions.	es
The Lisbon Summit therefore begins with this legacy and must further develop it in those aspects where it is not yet consolidated – and there are quite a few of them, because we do not yet have a single internal market in the areas we want to advance in Lisbon. Due to delays, there is no single internal market, for example, in public and private services, or in transparency and the use of modern technologies to truly complete the markets in terms of information and thus efficiency. This is where the necessary productivity increase must begin to achieve long-term economic development without inflation. However, we must be careful. We may be fragmenting this debate on Lisbon, but we must always keep in mind a very precise objective: we must create the economic and social conditions for sustainable growth. We have already mentioned the economic conditions, namely efficiency and productivity; the social conditions are about avoiding fragmentation and income disparities in our society – one of the greatest dangers. I repeat, because we should be mindful of this: income inequality has been widening in Europe recently. This problem will be insoluble, if not today, then tomorrow. This gives rise to both market and public responsibility. In Lisbon, we must make some very concrete decisions. In this regard, since reference has been made to the United States on several occasions, I would like to emphasize one particular aspect. In the United States, this new market, this innovation, and its dissemination—the tremendous leap forward is that this is an innovation, namely in telematics, which is bringing knowledge to the peripheries—are by no means solely due to private initiative. Significant public investment has been made at the federal, state, and local levels. Enormous sums have been invested in modern infrastructure. Please note: in this regard, our immediate—I repeat, immediate—obligation at the public and other levels is to establish telematic links, that is, the channels for these new information carriers. The market, private individuals, and companies will provide the infrastructure, while we are obliged to create the new information highways. Therefore, the commitment mentioned by Prime Minister Guterres to equip all schools with computers and to connect even the peripheral areas cannot be left exclusively to the market, because the market simply won't do it, and because, on the other hand, without these measures, we will not achieve the new, necessary productivity targets. We must therefore avoid a crisis in the peripheral economies, which in no way means centralization or centralized planning, but rather opening up the same opportunities to the peripheral economy as to the centralized economy. For this reason, the program must be directed at schools; this is why we must target an entire age group and insist on it, work to ensure that not a single person in this age group is left without this new form of literacy. Therefore, there is a precise strategy for Lisbon. In my opinion, Lisbon is primarily about sowing new courage for employment and growth, in the knowledge that we are capable of doing so; So we have to move towards this model based on safe equilibria.	de
I would like to focus in particular on one chapter that seems somewhat lacking to me: social policy. This would not be so bad if significant progress had been made over the past five years, but this has not been the case. However, in the area of social policy, the Commission and Parliament have the opportunity to achieve a great deal. I am thinking in particular of Chapter 1 of Title XI of the Treaty, and specifically the issue of working conditions and the improvement of the working environment. Regarding the health and safety of workers, a directive dating from 1989 is currently in force. In my view, and in the view of my group, this directive should be reviewed, particularly on the basis of a comprehensive study published by the Dublin Foundation in 1997. This study identified a general deterioration in working conditions in a number of important areas. This is something that deserves consideration, and I would like the Commission to give this matter serious consideration and determine how this directive needs to be amended to improve the situation. I do not want to go into the details of the content now, but rather deal with the processes involved in the legislative programme, that is to say, the presentation of the programme and its implementation. In this regard, I would like to set out two emphatic demands of the Green Group, which I would like to see Parliament adopt. However, today they will be expressed here simply as emphatic demands. Firstly, when a resolution is adopted by the House, particularly on the initiative of the European Parliament, then in my opinion the democratic rules of the game require that such a demand be seriously followed up by the Commission within a reasonable time. In the field of the environment, for example, we have a White Paper on civil liability for environmental damage. This is significant progress, but I would like to point out that this White Paper dates back to a Parliament resolution of 1994, that is, six years ago. And after the White Paper, it will certainly be a long time before a directive is published. This clearly shows that the process is very slow, and I believe a report is needed to explain why it is taking so long. Secondly, if a legislative proposal is announced in the legislative program but is not implemented in the current year, the reasons for this must be explained. Here's an example. Today, a proposal for a directive on electrical and electronic waste is being announced. This proposal has been discussed several times, but it has never been adopted. We know that this happened under pressure from the US administration, which is threatening to take the matter to the WTO, but it would be sensible, fair, democratic, and transparent if the Commission were to explain to us what is happening behind the scenes and why the proposal for this directive is taking so long. Allow me, President Prodi, to express my fears and anxieties about the approach of your program for 2000, which you have called a turning point—and not just because it contains no truly innovative proposals. What concerns us, rather, is the programmatic, semi-ideological approach of this work plan, your servile and uncritical adoption of the US model – that antisocial and drug-fuelled development model that keeps people above suspicion, such as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, awake at night.	de
The third objective is urban and rural development within the framework of a balanced spatial planning policy. The guidelines are, moreover, based on two horizontal principles: the development of rural areas – and the issue of sustainable transport infrastructure, Madam Rapporteur, which has long been close to my heart, particularly since my time as my country's Environment Minister, falls within the scope of rural development for me – and the second principle is equal opportunities, particularly between women and men, as well as the European employment strategy and Economic and Monetary Union. Madam Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, in response to the concerns you expressed during the debate, I would like to say that the guidelines stress the importance of establishing integrated development and conversion strategies so that the priorities mentioned can achieve the greatest possible synergy between the measures and enable effective decentralized partnerships. You are concerned because this partnership appears to have been ignored. However, it is clearly mentioned on page 5 of these guidelines, and I would like to point out, because you asked me to, that for me, and I have been in charge of a region long enough to be able to judge this, this partnership is a very effective instrument for mobilizing intellectual resources at local level – both those in the public sector – city and municipal councils, schools and the social sector, clubs and associations – and those in the private sector. And territorial pacts are, to respond to a comment by Mrs Angelilli, one of the forms of this decentralized partnership. The guidelines are organized according to thematic priorities so that they can be taken into account within the framework of each objective to varying degrees, depending on the specific situation of each Member State or its regions. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to respond briefly to some of your comments; firstly, on the procedure. It is true that the matter was brought to your attention late. I would, however, like to recall that after the Commission adopted the guidelines in draft form in February 1999, following a new procedure that simplified the submission of opinions on the text, my predecessor, Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, immediately forwarded them to Parliament. However, due to the European elections then approaching, your House was unable to begin examining the guidelines until after the text had been finally adopted in July 1999. Today, I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that we are only at the beginning of the negotiations on the programmes – the chairman of the committee, Mr Hatzidakis, has already asked me about this – and that your comments can therefore actually be taken into account by most Member States. I can also tell you that the Commission will take your House's opinion, as expressed in this report, into account when adopting the guidelines for the mandatory mid-term review. Now, to the substantive aspects of the guidelines. Madam Rapporteur, you have emphasized that this is about setting targets for a series of often very precisely defined European objectives. I cannot mention them all here: the introduction of cross-sectoral measures, more efficient use of public funds, support for the various partners in the joint development of regional or national programs, etc. The Commission takes note of this, but some of these targets or questions do not belong here, but rather in the Vademecum or the methodological document, for example.	de
We therefore propose to amend the legislation as follows. First, what is built thanks to LIFE funds should be reserved exclusively for public bodies, even at the cost of entrusting, through a tender, the management of the sites in question to associations recognized for the protection of nature. At stake is the continuity of the projects started, since private law associations can disappear or resell. It is aberrant from a philosophical point of view, as well as questionable from a legal point of view, that 100 percent of public money should be used to build a private land heritage, even with the claim of protecting the environment. Second, the selection and allocation criteria of LIFE funds should be defined, in order to avoid any suspicion of clientelism or ostracism. Third, prior consultation of the users and interested bodies should be required. For example, in France, the LIFE-Nature project for Grand-Lieu, developed without any consultation, has turned out to be a real ecological catastrophe: the operations intended to clear the downstream watercourse, Acheneau, of mud, and carried out in violation of French water law, have caused it to silt up, destroying spawning grounds, invading wetlands and causing other consequences that I will spare you. In reality, all that was achieved was a 3-kilometer shift of the mud at a cost of 6 million francs: a remedy that turned out to be worse than the disease, a predictable consequence and announced by all the operators on the site. The result? A lawsuit and a restoration cost higher than the sum allocated by the program. This is what we want to avoid. Fourthly, representatives of Parliament should be included in the committee responsible for the follow-up, and at least one MEP from each political group. MEPs must monitor the use of the funds for which they voted: this seems more than legitimate to me. Fifthly, a scientific, technical and financial report on the LIFE operations carried out should be published annually. Sixthly, there should be a serious and regular evaluation of the programmes. Seventhly, the use of these funds should be allowed in cases of environmental emergencies, for example, reforestation after a storm, restoration of natural spaces after an oil spill, etc. Here, Mr President, rapporteur, is the concrete, sensible, simple-to-implement proposal, designed to limit conflicts at local level and to justify the correct use of public funds, which we are putting forward before any increase ? of at least 40 percent! ? of the funds allocated to LIFE. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the report she has drawn up, but also the Commission because this report, this position, improves the texts currently in force. Furthermore, it has a more acceptable, clearer and more transparent structure. I would also like to congratulate the Commission services, because the evaluation, monitoring and follow-up of the LIFE programme reasonably guarantee the selection and implementation of projects. However, I would like to focus on a few aspects. Firstly, on its continuity, in which, in principle, I believe.	it
From the Community institutions, we are obliged to work to overcome these border scars, which contradict the spirit of European unity. The economic and social cohesion we advocate is embodied, through the Interreg initiative, in territorial cohesion and the integration of border areas and the peripheries of our continent. From its inception, Interreg has been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for territorial planning and a truly polycentric conception of European territory. The European Parliament, in agreement with this initiative, only regrets that we have to adopt a resolution on it when we still have not seen the evaluation of Interreg II. However, we are aware that it is not advisable to delay the implementation of this third edition any further, since it would jeopardize the success of several projects and the continuity of projects already underway. The success of Interreg is evident, as expressed by the local, regional, and national authorities that have participated in co-financed projects. Learning together, innovating, sharing projects and good practices, mutual understanding and tolerance—these are some of the lessons this initiative offers those involved. There are a whole series of interesting issues surrounding it: the observatory, the principle of concentration... I would like to focus on the management bodies. We need to seek common, interregional, and transnational management bodies, in which all local and regional authorities, as well as economic and social stakeholders, actively participate. Cases of parallel projects on both sides of the border should not be repeated. We need to create a cross-border culture, and to do so, we need to innovate in administrative cooperation, imaginatively overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the different levels of competence of each Member State, each region, and each municipality. It cannot be that a project cannot be implemented due to difficulties in dialogue. During the committee debates, we have also noted the difficulty of coordinating Interreg with other annual or biannual financial instruments, such as MEDA, TACIS, or PHARE. This Parliament's motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties, presenting the Commission with proposals capable of resolving them and setting reasonable deadlines for it to make the necessary modifications. Mr. President, I wish to speak in this debate because the URBAN initiative has been very successful, particularly in Ireland, and I am pleased that the European Union continues to contribute in this area. It is very sad that hundreds of communities, if not thousands, suffer from such profound poverty and disadvantage. Even in the wealthiest Member States and cities, large numbers of people live in ghettos, in situations where there are inadequate facilities, where education is quite poor, where physical infrastructure is underdeveloped, and where drugs and other problems are widespread. It seems to me that, for the European Union to demonstrate that it truly helps the citizens of the European Union, it must work with the Member States to make it clear that the EU works for its citizens and their families.	es
It is very useful. It is an excellent contribution from Mr. Swoboda and his colleagues. We are very grateful to him for having been at the forefront of this matter, as are some of his colleagues, some of whom are present in the House this evening - Mrs. Pack, Mr. Lagendijk, and others. I am very pleased that our general relations with FYROM are so good. Perhaps Mr. Dupuis, as well as his interpreter, will forgive me for using this expression in the spirit of entente cordiale. The excellent representative of the European Union in that country has contributed to this. He has been a great friend of the European Parliament and an excellent servant of the Commission. The best example of the quality of our relations is the imminent start of negotiations on the Stabilization and Association Agreement. As is also FYROM's cooperation with regard to the reconstruction of Kosovo. I thank the Macedonian authorities for their assistance in recent weeks in addressing the considerable difficulties in supplying electricity to Kosovo. Like some Members, I recognize the stabilizing role that country played during the tragedy in the Balkans, particularly with regard to the integration of the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country. A few weeks ago, I met with the newly elected President Georgievski and, like others, was extremely impressed by his commitment to multi-ethnicity and pluralism. Allow me to present to you the state of play of these negotiations, which other countries in the region—as Mr. Lagendijk said—are observing with immense interest. On 24 January this year, the Council adopted its negotiating directives for a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This represents the most important step forward in the Stabilization and Association Process for the Western Balkans initiated by the Commission in May 1999. Allow me to clarify the main elements of these draft directives. They include the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with FYROM. They include provisions for improving regional cooperation, including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region, although I would like to make it clear that this is not an attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia. They include the prospect of establishing a free trade area between the European Union and these countries within 10 years of the agreement's entry into force. They include provisions on the movement of workers, freedom of establishment, the provision of services, current payments, and capital movements. They include a commitment by FYROM to approximate its legislation to that of the European Community, particularly in key areas of the internal market; and they include provisions for cooperation with FYROM in a wide range of areas, including justice and home affairs. We are now making the necessary preparations within the Commission so that negotiations can begin in March. I am due to visit FYROM during the second week of March.	fr
"After two European Parliament elections and a major new reform of the Union Treaties, our relations with the Czech Republic have developed extremely dynamically. An association agreement is in force and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up with delegates from the European and Czech Parliaments. In 1996, your country submitted its official application to join the Union. Finally, in 1998, accession negotiations were officially opened. The process of European integration and enlargement has accelerated dramatically since the fall of the Iron Curtain. The end of the artificial separation of Europe marks the beginning of a new era. We are facing a historic challenge that offers various prospects for all Europeans. Mr President, you, who were also the founder and signatory of Charter 77 - the human rights movement that represented and asserted fundamental values in a dark period in the history of your people - are a powerful symbol of these developments. For defending the freedom and dignity of the person, you were sentenced to almost five years in prison by a communist regime. But you never lost hope and history has proved you right. Ten years have passed since the ""velvet revolution"" claimed Havel na HRAD. For ten years, as President, you represented first democratic Czechoslovakia and then the Czech Republic. Reconciliation with your neighbours has always been an essential objective for you, which you have defended with firmness and perseverance. We consider you to be a first-class European. Today, the Czech Republic is preparing to become a member of our Union. Experience has taught us, and you, Mr President, will agree, that the process of enlargement of the Union is not always free of pitfalls, for both sides. The Czech Republic will therefore have to make considerable efforts to meet all the conditions for membership. The European Union, for its part, will have to adapt its institutions and its policy in view of enlargement. It has already taken a major step forward under Agenda 2000. The next stage, which is institutional reform, will begin this year at the new Intergovernmental Conference, of which the European Parliament is an active part. Our responsibility as Members is to ensure maximum openness and transparency so that, at the appropriate time, the citizens of the European Union and those of the Czech Republic approve, through their representatives, the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union. Mr President, it is with great pleasure that I give you the floor. (Applause) Mr President, on behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to thank you warmly for the strong message you have addressed to us and, moreover, the applause of my colleagues shows how much we appreciated your words. I would like to thank you for reminding us that different nationalities are perfectly compatible with European membership. Starting from your personal experience, you have shown us that European membership cannot be imposed, as it is a spontaneous and natural path. Your words have struck me: they express what we all feel deeply."	it
I declare the session of the European Parliament suspended. (The sitting was adjourned at 12:25 p.m.) Resumption of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament, which was suspended on Thursday, 3 February 2000, resumed. Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting The Minutes of the sitting of Thursday, 3 February, have been distributed. Are there any comments? I note from your reaction that many Members have not received these Minutes, and it is quite obvious that you cannot adopt Minutes that you have not received. I therefore propose that they be submitted for your approval tomorrow morning, since you clearly do not have them, and for that I apologize. The adoption of the Minutes is therefore postponed. Madam President, this is a procedural motion. This morning, the BBC reported that a British Member of this House, who holds a senior position within its delegation, continues to provide strategic advice to private clients without declaring who they are in the Register of Financial Interests. The citizens of Europe have a right to expect their representatives not to mix public interests with private benefits. However, they can only be certain that this is not the case if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible. Madam President, since these matters are currently before the Quaestors, may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Financial Interests is updated and amended to cover cases of this kind and, importantly, to ensure that this Register is not only open to scrutiny by this House but also published on the internet? Thank you, Mr Davies. I will take this up with the College of Quaestors. Madam President, this is a point of order. As today marks the first Valentine's Day of the new millennium, I hope you will agree that it would be appropriate for this Parliament to mark the day by making a firm commitment to tackle cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in Europe. I urge Member States to align themselves with the commitment made today during the Winning Hearts Conference, namely that every child born in the new millennium has the right to live at least to the age of 65 without suffering from preventable cardiovascular disease. Happy Valentine's Day! Madam President, I rise pursuant to Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and refer to the point raised by Mr. Davies regarding the very serious allegations broadcast on BBC radio this morning. I would appreciate your assurance that you will order an inquiry to ensure that the two Members named in this particular BBC interview are not running their companies from this Parliament or parliamentary offices, as that would be very serious indeed. The double standards pursued in the past by the British Conservatives have brought the UK House of Commons into disrepute, and such behaviour would very likely have a similar impact on this Parliament.	fr
"And he does the same. We discussed it, we expressed unanimity, with the exception of the EPP Group and the European Liberal Democrats and Reformists Party, and I myself noted—as my dear fellow Presidents will recall—that it is not a question of whether you are for or against the Todin tax, but of whether you dare to understand what the Commission and the Council think about it. That is not asking too much. Therefore, I reiterate the proposal to maintain this oral question to the Commission and the Council in order to know once and for all what the position of those two bodies is regarding this relatively modest proposal, but one that would send an important signal to public opinion, especially after the shock caused by the failure of the Seattle Conference. The proposal of the EPP-ED Group to remove the oral question on the capital tax from the agenda was voted on. (Parliament rejected the proposal by 164 votes in favor, 166 votes against, and 7 abstentions) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr. Poettering for the publicity he has just given to this debate. Thank you. Madam President, has my vote, which could not be cast electronically because I do not have my card, been counted? My vote was ""in favor."" Madam President, the Presidency has announced the result of the vote. No changes can be made. Madam President, in the previous vote—and I will abide by your decision on this matter—on the question of the Commission's strategic plan, I indicated that I would have liked to speak before the vote on behalf of my group. This did not happen. I would be grateful if, at the close of this item, I could give an explanation of the vote on behalf of my group. This is an important matter. It would be useful if the record of the House would record how people perceive what we have done in the light of their own political analyses. Madam President, I do not wish to resume the debate, but I had also requested the floor to give my opinion on Mr. Barón Crespo's amendment. You did not mention me either. I am sorry, but the vote has been taken, the decision has been taken, and therefore, let us leave it at that. I am very sorry, Mr. Hänsch, Mr. Cox, I did not realize that you were requesting the floor. In these circumstances, I believe the positions are clear and will be reflected in the Minutes. When the approval of the Minutes of today's sitting is discussed tomorrow, if you feel that the positions have not been explained well enough, you may request amendments. I think it is a good formula. Of course, the Minutes of tomorrow's sitting will record all the additional explanations. I believe this formula is better than proceeding now with explanations of vote, which would take a long time. Mr. Hänsch, Mr. Cox, is that okay with you? Madam President, if the voting record correctly records how my Group voted, I neither wish nor can raise any objections."	es
Values must come before power. We therefore deplore what is happening in Austria. Even more, we are shaken by it. We are deeply disappointed. We call on the ÖVP to further examine alternative solutions. We continue to insist on Article 6 of the Treaty. We continue to combat the trivialization of the extreme right. If the coalition were to be formed after all, we call on our ÖVP colleagues to guarantee in their programs, as well as in their words and actions, respect for the principles and values that form the foundations of European integration. Madam President, dear colleagues, Austria faces a heavy responsibility. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that in this Parliament we are largely in agreement in our rejection of Haider and his policies, but it is equally clear that opinions diverge on the question of how best to combat this policy. Have you even considered the repercussions in Austria of this debate and the statement made last weekend by the Council Presidency? Have you asked yourself whether we share the responsibility for the future development of the political situation in Austria if we decide to pass judgment on this matter? Have you even asked yourself what would happen if the wish of one of our colleagues were granted and elections were held in Austria in the coming days? Observers unanimously agree that Haider would emerge even stronger. Who could want such a thing? Do we not have a responsibility to carefully consider how to combat such a policy? Europe is a community governed by the rule of law. Among the principles we must uphold are democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. The democratic requirement implies that one can deplore election results but must respect them, and that is why we must respect the decision taken by the Austrians for reasons inherent in their policy. The rule of law requires that the Council Presidency not express itself as it did, in a way that contradicts the Treaties. Political intelligence dictates not isolating the ÖVP but supporting it, as an undeniably democratic party, respectful of the rule of law and having proven its European commitment, so that Austria remains just as undeniably a member of this European Community. That is why we must support our colleagues from the ÖVP in this difficult situation, and isolation is the completely wrong path. (Applause) Madam President, where I come from, they say that a Welshman always takes three tries. This is indeed the third time – as you will notice in the course of this debate – that I have indicated my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent, and at times disturbing, debate. First of all, I would like to thank, on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission, several Members of this House for their support and understanding of the position taken by the Commission in the statement we made yesterday.	fr
"I also support a move towards a linear career system, as the current system of career categories no longer meets the needs of our institutions. It certainly blocks the advancement and mobility of people with proven high potential. Those Members who have duly praised Commission staff during this debate, the vast majority of whom are normally distinguished by their hard work, high integrity, and efficiency, are absolutely right in their comments. The White Paper on the reform strategy will contain a detailed presentation of our approaches to this and other issues; precision in detail is, of course, paramount. There will therefore be several communications on this topic in the coming months, and each one will be open to debate and discussion in this Chamber. It is now absolutely clear that we must work closely with Parliament as an institution on key issues of common interest, in particular on salaries and pensions and the Staff Regulations. In connection with this last point, we are considering the usefulness of adopting a framework regulation containing general provisions on key issues such as remuneration, employment conditions, staff representation rights, etc., but empowering individual institutions to introduce implementing rules on other matters. Initial thoughts from the plenary on this consultative approach would be particularly welcome. Finally, I would like to address paragraph 15 of the draft resolution before you, which addresses the resource requirements of our reform strategies. This is a very important point. We are certain that we will enjoy a significant ""reform dividend"" once the modernization measures have translated into increased efficiency and better management of resources. However, it is absolutely clear that parts of the Commission's services are already operating at full capacity. This has been raised several times by Parliament. Second, it is equally clear that the reform will require some new investment in training and technology. Third, there is absolutely no doubt that preparations for enlargement must be intensified. They are already impacting the availability of funds. It is also clear that, as we take on new tasks—which will certainly be presented to us by the Council and Parliament—we will have to identify and eliminate so-called ""negative priorities"" in order to create additional capacity. A central feature of our reform will therefore be more decisive action to link priority setting with decisions on resources, based on activity-based budgeting. However, I would like to emphasize that, while the internal discipline in setting priorities is being introduced by the Commission, it can only be effective if Parliament and the Council also take it into account and demonstrate a similarly determined attitude towards the Commission's demands. For this reason, the Commission welcomes paragraph 15 of the van Hulten report. Mr President, I would like to conclude by thanking the House for its attention during what was inevitably a lengthy speech. At the same time, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, the Committee on Budgetary Control, and the other committees that submitted their opinions. We look forward to working closely with the plenary in finalising the reform strategy package and, more importantly, to continued good cooperation over the years required to tackle such difficult tasks."	de
"It is simply acknowledging their inferiority. But as far as I know, we have never felt inferior to men, and even more so in politics. So I believe that we are all fighting this battle to help our compatriots gain access to decision-making power, to access positions of responsibility in the political sphere, but I believe that this will only happen with a real revolution in mentalities. We must all be strong enough together to force our political leaders to impose of their own accord the participation of women in political decision-making powers. (SV) Mr President, Madam Minister, Madam Commissioner, ""half the sky is held up by women,"" an enlightened man once said. But when it comes to important decisions and priority issues, women's voices are lacking. Women, who constitute more than half the population, are largely underrepresented in the fields of politics, economics and social action. This is unacceptable in a democracy. When it comes to gender equality, nowhere is the gap between law and practice more stark than in decision-making bodies. To achieve balance, a concrete action plan with a fixed timeframe is needed. An important part of this plan would be a benchmarking system that can ensure the full participation of women in power structures and decision-making processes. I am therefore pleased that the Commissioner supports such a system. I propose that European targets for women's participation in decision-making processes be based on the average achieved in the three most advanced Member States, with an annual report provided by all Member States. These reports would then be evaluated. Women are the primary victims of human rights violations—including rape and sexual abuse, domestic abuse, and the trafficking of women—yet they are underrepresented in the judicial and legislative institutions responsible for prosecuting these crimes. As a result, they are not considered a priority, and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted. Women are also the most numerous victims of armed conflicts, yet they remain absent from efforts to preserve peace, resolve conflicts, and rebuild. This is why we urge Member States, in the text of the resolution, to increase the number of women involved in all these peace-building activities. Equal participation of women and men in decision-making processes is not only a matter of social justice and democracy; it is also a necessity in order to fully utilize women's experiences and knowledge. Not utilizing women's capabilities in decision-making is an unacceptable waste. Women must not only ""hold up half the sky,"" but also have the right to take their share of responsibility in decisions that affect the entire planet. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the Council Presidency and the Commissioner for their excellent interventions. We have high expectations of your action. We are entering a millennium and a century that we hope will be decisive for women and for their ability to occupy decision-making positions."	fr
"If a Directorate-General considers this to be a relevant and effective way of increasing financial control, the ex ante system can be used. Naturally, there are different requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions that Directorates-General must carry out. The White Paper also takes this into account, but where there is a desire and demonstrated need to use this system, it can certainly be done. Finally, with regard to the transition, I share Mrs. Theato's reservations about so-called ""soft rules."" That is something we have already discussed, and the Honourable Member knows that I distinguish between various forms of codes that can have a positive effect and can eventually be converted into—we could say, I suppose—""mandatory rules."" But in that regard, I see no possibility of soft rules, which is why, during the transition period, there will be full compliance with the current financial regulation until the legislation is amended through a properly democratic process in this House and in the Council. The White Paper contains absolute guarantees and provisions in this regard. However, in addition—and this is very important, because it is a transition period—there will be training, advice, support, and guarantees: the new head of the audit unit will take office on 1 May, and with that and a host of other guarantees, I believe we can be sure, as far as humanly possible, that there will be a completely secure system even during the transition period. I must make two further observations, because this is a key issue for the reform. The first is that there are those who feel—for reasons I fully understand—that in this transition there is a danger of irresponsibility or inertia. Irresponsibility, because there is a feeling in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline. I completely reject this, and I base my opinion simply on the criteria of Commission officials, the responsibility of the Directors-General, and the guarantees we have introduced into the system. Inertia would be a result solely of anxiety, and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to reduce the possibility of this occurring. Finally, the system we currently have—as the Committee of Independent Experts very firmly stated—is already unsustainable. In fact, the Court of Auditors has deemed it a fiction. In any case, there will have to be a change, which would entail a transition period, because there is no possibility of inventing any system that would allow us to move from one system to another from one Friday to the next Monday. To the extent that is possible with all the information at our disposal and all the design capacity we have, I am confident that we have installed—or will install—based on our proposals a system that will provide the Union, its taxpayers, and this House with complete security."	es
"Greater control at national level, by national governments over national banks, but also greater control at international level, for example through the International Monetary Fund. I therefore believe that the causes of the problem can best be addressed if, on the one hand, good governance practices are duly respected in the countries concerned and, on the other hand, greater control is ensured at national and international level to prevent these uncontrolled phenomena. Madam President, several Members of Parliament have said that more money should be made available for large-scale projects. Mrs Kreissl-Dörfler, for example, spoke, in English, of ""long-term financing for long-term projects"". That is an absolutely obvious request. My response to this request is that first of all the countries should keep their promise to allocate 0.7% of their gross national product to development aid and cooperation, so that a much larger volume of funding can be used for long-term projects in the way specifically provided for this purpose, that is to say through contributions to development cooperation, and not through the Tobin tax, which would be an artificial and probably harmful form of financing. Madam President, I would like to conclude my speech here. As regards the resolution, for which I have seen a proposal, the Commission is waiting to hear the result of the vote in Parliament before defining its position. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this evening's debate. I have received four motions for resolutions under Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure. Madam President, I regret that I do not have your command of French. However, I would be happy if Commissioner Bolkestein would listen for a moment, which I do not think is possible given that he is speaking to Mrs Randzio-Plath. Could you remind him that I still have something to say? Mr Bolkestein, I want to say something! Unfortunately, I do not speak as good a Dutch as you do. However, I would like to make a few comments to you. The fact that we are in favour of the Tobin tax does not represent an initiative by Parliament against the Commission. We want to explore the possibilities of introducing this tax as one of many possible instruments and we hope that you will be on our side in this. Politically, I always have my doubts when people say that an initiative is not necessary, that we do not want it, that we cannot implement it. It is not your job to decide on this, but ours. This shows to some extent the new awareness that has arisen in Parliament. I would like to discuss this with you, nothing more, nothing less. However, we can immediately drop any other option; I regard you as a serious Commissioner who intends to carry out your work with commitment and as such I respect you. I ask you in turn to respect us Members who intend to take our tasks, including the Tobin tax, with the same seriousness! Madam President, it seems that there has been an oversight and that the list of resolutions tabled, which you yourself have just mentioned, does not include the joint compromise resolution tabled by the PSE, the Liberals, the GUE Group, the Greens and Mr Kuntz and Mr Coûteaux."	it
This coordination does not exist at the moment, nor has the Commission yet presented any concrete proposals for improving it. Here in Parliament, we are waiting for the Commission to submit a more detailed report on this matter to our parliamentary committee as soon as possible. It is of crucial importance to ensure that local businesses, organizations, and other stakeholders are involved in the practical implementation of the programs. Experience shows that cooperation projects must be better planned, that their monitoring must be more precise, and that they must be more cost-effective. Many projects have been left halfway and have become ineffective in the web of administration and bureaucracy. The parties must also be required to commit to the projects and fulfill their obligations. Our group is reintroducing several amendments that were rejected by the parliamentary committee during the preparations. I would like to submit for consideration the report on URBAN, in whose arguments the rapporteur has plausibly addressed the Commission's guidelines regarding the establishment of a minimum sum of €500 per inhabitant. This should not be pursued as a mechanical objective, but must be adapted to the specific conditions of the target region. This perspective is so important that it must be included in the conclusions, and not remain a mere argument. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the Structural Funds. It will not only finance projects in one region, in one country, but also in neighboring regions, in two or more countries. Unfortunately, this is true only for part of the resources, that is, only for the EU's internal borders. However, regions located along borders with third countries in particular need a functioning instrument for cross-border cooperation. The regulation is misleading, as if this were also the case. However, this is not the case. The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has long demanded it. Looking ahead, this means that for these regions, a further deterioration in the form of outdated development of marginal areas will once again occur. Since 1996, Parliament has been calling for a fund to be set up for cooperation with third countries to eliminate difficulties. Nothing has happened. The difficulties continue to drag on, to the detriment of the affected regions. Parliament is once again calling for improved cross-border cooperation, and we hope that a common fund will be set up and that the regulation will be amended once again in collaboration with the other Commissioners. We want a Europe for citizens, not a Europe of bureaucrats. Mr. President, a third of European Union funds are spent on funds for all kinds of development objectives. My group is delighted if this helps bridge the gap with the most disadvantaged regions, cities, and population groups, or if health conditions and living conditions are improved. It is a question of solidarity and progress. But distributing ever more money is no guarantee that it will be spent increasingly better.	es
It would have been better if we had tried to reach a compromise by formulating a common position. I believe that, in doing so, the European Parliament is being excluded from the debate at a time when a particularly interesting development is taking place in the European Union, in which a broad socio-economic programme is being developed much more clearly. The Portuguese Presidency has presented a broad programme document for the extraordinary summit in Lisbon. The Commission has taken the same approach in its five-year programme, also mentioning one of the four priorities. The document that the Commission has produced for the Lisbon summit also refers to a broad approach that covers many areas. I am convinced that this is the right path: the development of a broad socio-economic approach within the European Union, also because it is from this economic entity that politics arises. I believe that, in this respect, the European Parliament will be able to play a limited role both in Lisbon and in the context of the meeting to which we are invited in June. But what positions should we take there? Should we simply admit that we are still stuck in the old political oppositions that exist? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the House for the seriousness and thoroughness with which it has worked. The expert hearings and the debates in committee have provided us with additional information of considerable quality. Furthermore, during this afternoon's debate, significant divergences were identified as to possible policies. I believe, however, that I can discern some elements of consensus. We all agree that the current economic situation is positive and that we must try to move forward and exploit the current opportunity in order to improve circumstances and achieve a clear improvement in employment. I would like to dwell only briefly on these issues and instead go into the last point which I believe to be the priority in today's debate. Yesterday, as some of you have noted, the Committee on Economic Affairs illustrated the improvement in the economic situation in Europe. We can assume that this positive trend, already highlighted in the outlook in November, could even prove better than initially expected. Employment growth continues at a good pace. It is true that inflation, despite yesterday's figures, must be controlled - we have reached around 2 percent according to the latest data from December - but it is also true that underlying inflation highlights that inflationary tensions are due to very specific elements, such as the rise in the price of oil and, of course, the trend in the exchange rate. When presenting the report, we already referred to the possible risks to growth. We highlighted the possibility of experiencing difficulties in American growth and therefore in other areas of the world, as well as the possibility of a certain recovery in inflation. This recovery in inflation could be significant especially if it ends up generating cost inflation. For this reason, we reiterate the need for a wage policy compatible with the definitions of inflation that we intend to establish.	it
Allow me to thank Mr Andersson for his response to his main question and to answer it as follows. Firstly, Finland and Denmark have exceptions to the principle of free movement of goods until 2003. These countries are taking preparatory measures to be ready for free access for alcoholic products by the year 2003. In the case of Sweden, the situation is somewhat different. In 1995, it was decided to introduce a five-year derogation period, which is now expiring. I have not yet heard any arguments on the basis of which the Commission should consider extending this period. Secondly, we are maintaining a process of ongoing consultation with the Swedish Government. I can inform Mr. Andersson that I will be going to Stockholm on 6 March to hold talks with Minister Ringholm, with members of the Swedish Parliament and, upon request, with the Prime Minister or other ministers, with a view to continuing the debate on this issue, which – I fully understand – is the subject of intense political passion in Sweden. Thirdly, I naturally understand very well the importance of the health aspect of this issue. I repeat once again that Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated that, whatever developments may occur with regard to import restrictions, alcohol consumption in Sweden will remain unchanged. The question then, of course, is where the quantity of alcohol that is not brought in by travelers arriving in the country comes from. The answer is either it is smuggled in or the alcohol is produced by the Swedes themselves, and, as Mr. Andersson knows, this is a particularly dangerous and harmful process. That said, Mr. Andersson seems to think that the health situation improves if alcohol imports are restricted. In this case, however, not only Sweden but all European Union countries should start from the principle of banning all alcohol sales. We have seen a similar example in the United States. Mr. Andersson is certainly aware of what was called prohibition. He also knows what resulted in mafia activities in the United States, where prohibition was eventually ended. This simply means that we must, of course, protect health, but not by banning alcohol, because that serves no purpose. Mr President, this is, in fact, revenue from the Swedish alcohol monopoly, and if the Swedish government says that it must cover costs in the health sector in this way, this still proves that it is a distortion of competition, since other countries have to finance their own costs in the sector without having a monopoly on alcohol. What I would like to know is whether you are also aware of any studies that show that moderate consumption of quality alcohol, for example Franconian wine or Bavarian beer, is good for health and would therefore reduce the burden on the Swedish budget. I understand that Mr Posselt has started to look at the fiscal aspects of this matter. I also understand that the high taxation of alcoholic products in Sweden dates back to 1638 and that, since then, the state has received a significant portion of its tax revenue from the sale of alcoholic products.	fr
But my criticism, or rather, to put it bluntly, my anger, is directed exclusively at those who have caused and are still causing such reactions, Messrs. Schüssel and Haider and their parties... ... as well as their representatives in the European Parliament. Mr Poettering, I find it interesting that you are in a situation almost as difficult as I am today, although for different reasons. Today you have to defend something that you do not actually want to defend - Mr Schüssel - and you have to take note that this same Schüssel, as I have heard, was recently excluded from the top of the Christian Democratic Party representatives. Mr Poettering also argued that the spell cast by Haider could only be broken by integrating him into the political system. I maintain, however, that Haider, like other far-right movements, cannot and does not want to be integrated into this political system, into our political system, and into this Europe. Anyone who feeds on prejudices against foreigners and minorities and feeds such prejudices, anyone who has pettiness and anti-liberalism in his political program, anyone who behaves rudely and contemptuously in international relations, anyone who has never clearly and unequivocally distanced himself from National Socialism, certainly has no intention or willingness to integrate! (Applause) It is the great historical fault of the conservatives to voluntarily huddle with the wolf waiting to be eaten by it. But in this way the wolf is fed, instead of being kept at bay, and the ÖVP is forced to sacrifice itself. I fully understand that Europe and the civilized world want to have as little to do as possible with such a government. But there is also another Austria, the Austria that, with thousands and thousands of citizens, demonstrated against the participation of the FPÖ in the government, the Austria that will continue to demonstrate against that government. I ask this Europe to give that Austria its support and its help. (Applause) The stronger this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is against authoritarian tendencies within it, the more effectively we will be able to fight against the roots of right-wing extremism. Because Europe is and remains the greatest guarantee against xenophobia and demagogy, yes, even against the return to barbarism. Support the Austrian people against this government! (Applause) Mr President, this is a historic moment because we see that the European Union is finally becoming a community of values and principles. This is becoming all the clearer now, when the government of a Member State is about to be formed with the support of a party that, as is well known, does not respect these values. I would also like to stress that the concerns expressed by the fourteen Member States of the Council are justified. The fact that this issue concerns the composition of a government of a Member State of the European Union means that it also falls within the competence of the Council and, therefore, cannot be regarded as a purely internal affair of Austria. As Members of the European Parliament we need to do more to highlight the importance of the work done in strengthening fundamental rights.	it
This would force all major industries in EU countries to pay billions of pounds or euros, and this cost would be passed on to the price and therefore to buyers of new cars. Since European car manufacturers started production decades earlier than Japanese, Korean and other manufacturers, they would be burdened more heavily, to the advantage of their competitors in other countries. I congratulate Mr Florenz, Mr Lange and the other Members who have tried to bridge the party divide and reach a compromise based on sharing the costs, and I ask you to support the amendment tabled on behalf of myself and my colleagues from Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and the UK to remove the retrospective aspect of the provision. Retrospective laws are bad laws, unjust laws and often unworkable laws. Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject them in principle unless they are in the public interest, which is not the case here. That is why I have asked for a roll-call vote. We want to see who is prepared to vote in favour of a retroactive law, of dubious legality, which would place a heavy economic burden on all future car buyers and would have a devastating effect on the European car industry. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly recall once again the economic stakes of this directive and reiterate my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange. Indeed, these amendments have the advantage - and I would like to insist on this point - of reconciling environmental requirements and economic imperatives. The Council, in its common position, said that car manufacturers should bear, in full or in large part, the costs of take-back and recycling. But as Mr Lange rightly said, this solution is completely unfair to European manufacturers. Coming from a country where there are actually car manufacturers, and I can assure you that it is not possible to impose on them, retroactively, the full cost assumption of all vehicles of their brand currently in circulation, that is, in fact, to assume costs imposed by 80 percent of the European car fleet. This solution is unacceptable because these manufacturers have not been able to integrate into their production processes and their cost prices the environmental requirements that we impose on them today. The common position puts European manufacturers at a disadvantage compared to manufacturers who have recently entered the European market. Of course, we are not here to defend this or that national interest, this or that industrial lobby, but to build a competitive Europe on the world market and to defend jobs in the economic sectors in which we are actually competitive. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to support the amendments tabled by Mr Bernd Lange, which will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they do indeed reconcile all the interests at stake - economic interests and environmental requirements - while leaving the Member States free to decide how to apply these requirements; the amendments in question provide that the systems in force in the Member States, and there are some that work very well, can continue to function.	it
I hope that the decisions taken in Helsinki will lead to progress on the Cyprus issue and that a new era of hope will dawn for Cyprus. I would welcome Turkey now playing a constructive role in the Cyprus issue. I am pleased that both the Council and the Commission welcome the UN's efforts to launch proximity talks between the two communities in Cyprus, with the aim of promoting reconciliation and confidence-building between them. I welcome the Commission's support for the bi-zonal, bi-communal, federal Cyprus that the United Nations has long championed and that both the Greek and Turkish sides in Cyprus should work hard to build. I am pleased about the political thaw in relations between the Greek and Turkish governments. I hope this will have a positive impact on the Cyprus talks. I also hope that some of the aid available to Cyprus in preparation for accession will be used to promote this reconciliation and the building of trust, and that both sides of the separated communities in Cyprus will accept and use this money in the spirit in which it is given. All of us in the European institutions – in Parliament, the Council, and the Commission – should do our utmost to help Cyprus find a peaceful solution that can reunite the two communities that have been separated for so many years. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Verheugen, the regulation on accession aid is not exactly a showcase for the Commission's coherent work. This cobbled-together of auxiliary constructions strikes me as rather amateurish. This applies both to the substantive formulation and the financial aspect. I believe we can therefore hardly present the Union's accession activities to the citizens of Cyprus and Malta as proof that it is worthwhile to join. Václav Havel rightly said today that the political quality of the European Union is measured by what it brings to the individual. From the perspective of civil society, what a regulation achieves is crucial. This regulation is not exactly a winning strategy in this regard. It contains clauses on external control and is provisional, and that is no way to shine. The quality of aid is measured by the following criteria: Is it decentralized, is it transparent, is it close to the people, and does it work? Nevertheless, for the divided island of Cyprus, this pre-accession strategy as a whole represents a major political challenge. In my view, it is the task of the European Union to use all its instruments, including this one, to contribute to a political solution to the conflict on the island. At this point, I must say that the European Parliament's amendment is particularly important to me. The Commission and the Council are also delivering very hopeful speeches today. I am very, very pleased that we are moving in the same direction.	de
"Today's adoptions are not only contrary to the Treaty and grant the Union's bodies more powers than they deserve, but above all, they will have the opposite effect. These sanctions will not weaken Mr. Haider or the FPÖ; quite the contrary; they will strengthen them. We will achieve exactly the opposite of what we seek. This is not the way to combat racism and the rise of the extreme right. The Danish Liberal Members of the European Parliament insist that today's adoption does NOT constitute, IN ANY WAY, Parliament's support for the diplomatic sanctions decided by the fourteen Prime Ministers against Austria. This is why the Danish Liberal Members of the Assembly supported the Liberal Members' very firm disavowal of any form of xenophobia in Austria and elsewhere. We attach great importance to the possible use of the new provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which allow for the deprivation of voting rights in the EU Council of Ministers of any country that, through its actions, violates the fundamental rights of citizens through discrimination, etc. (Article 7). The participation of the Freedom Party in the Austrian government represents a dangerous development for the political future of the European Union. This is the ""belly of the beast,"" which, unfortunately, is appearing on the political scene more than at any time since the Second World War. The European Parliament and the governments of the Union are obliged to politically isolate a government in which admirers of Nazism and advocates of xenophobia participate. The European Union bears great responsibility - and with it, the members of the two main political currents, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats - because by dogmatically clinging to the harsh financial policies of the EMU, by dismembering the welfare state, by deifying unbridled competition, it has marginalized large sections of society and offers far-right demagogues like Haider the opportunity to enlist supporters in their neo-Nazi adventure. Since the European Parliament's rules of procedure do not allow us to present our own resolution condemning Haider's party, as well as all parties in any European country that propagate racist, xenophobic and anti-migrant worker infamies, we voted for the compromise resolution, without approving several of its recitals or terms, to show our solidarity with those in Austria itself who oppose the Austrian far right and its demagogy. Our vote in no way signifies an endorsement of the parties that signed this compromise resolution, nor of their current policies, nor of their future attitude in the event of a worsening threat from the extreme right. Some of these parties, which claim to be republican and democratic, are adopting, out of complacency or electoral calculation, the demagogy of the extreme right, if only by blaming, openly or hypocritically, the presence of immigrant workers for unemployment and making their lives more difficult. More generally, those of the signatory parties that lead or have led the governments of various countries in the European Union bear their share of responsibility for the influence acquired by the extreme right by pursuing a policy that, out of devotion to the interests of big business, refuses to take measures likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it causes and thus facilitates the xenophobic demagogy of the extreme right."	fr
"We believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3 financed by LEADER with the remaining actions financed in the same areas by other Community programmes for interregional and international cooperation and partnership, such as INTERREG, SAPARD, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA. - (DE) Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, before examining the EQUAL report in more detail, I would like to focus on the fundamental aspects of the employment guidelines on which the report is based. The main objectives of an EU-wide employment policy have been identified as employability, entrepreneurship and adaptability. These objectives, it seems, should ensure that workers become as useful and usable as possible for the economy. However, an approach that aims to truly and effectively eliminate discrimination should have as its aim the self-determination of individuals. But then it would no longer be a question of promoting economic usability but rather of equal rights. Mrs Stenzel's report, however, is well developed, at least within the framework of the intended orientations. All asylum seekers and refugees should be explicitly included in the programmes, which should be a given. The Conservatives, however, voted against in committee. I would ask them the following question: is the aim of your policy to marginalise people? What is behind the idea of banning those who want to work? Doesn't that contradict the orientation of ""employability?"" It is also noteworthy that it is a mainstreaming programme, because the report still has a serious shortcoming. It is emphasised that women should be given more opportunities on the labour market by building more childcare centres. Anyone who lets men pursue their career advancement in peace and is concerned only with nurseries, without questioning the unequal distribution of reproductive activity, has unfortunately not understood what mainstreaming means! Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report in its final deliberation with no votes against and only one abstention. I would like to point this out explicitly at the beginning of my speech to highlight the difference in positions with respect to the Committee on Employment, which is responsible for the report. The approval of the opinion by all political groups is based on the conclusions in which the issues of regional policy, transport and tourism are linked to aspects of combating all forms of discrimination and inequality in the context of the labour market. The Members of the Committee on Regional Policy have also, of course, highlighted a number of critical points in the Commission's proposal: firstly, the insufficient clarification of the thematic guidelines for the activities of development partnerships; secondly, the fact that rigorous selection criteria for the evaluation of proposed projects have not yet been defined by the Commission; thirdly, the amount of administrative burden, probably excessive, for the management of projects by the Commission and the technical assistance bodies."	it
"The Commission can undertake to inform Parliament regularly about the published invitations to tender. We would like them to appear on the Internet as well, so as to ensure maximum transparency on this specific point. Another issue raised concerns the remaining information that could be important for Parliament on macroeconomic assistance. I would like to inform you that the Commission is prepared to inform the Chairmen of the various parliamentary committees concerned on a regular basis on a confidential basis - should the nature of the information provided so require - on the various initiatives undertaken for macroeconomic assistance operations. I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that with the final decision of the Council it will be possible to release these funds and make a positive contribution that will allow us to continue the considerable effort made by several parties in Kosovo with a view to achieving better peace and coexistence. Mr President, I am pleased that the views of Parliament, and of the Committee on Budgets in particular, and of the Commission are convergent. We assure you that we will always remain faithful to every commitment aimed at supporting the Commission in carrying out its task. However, after listening to the Commissioner, I am a little concerned about the commitments made by the services in the Committee on Budgets. It was clearly established - I am not saying it was a good thing or a bad thing, but it was a contract - between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was convergence on Amendments Nos 4 and 7, that is, that there was agreement on the idea of making the release of the second tranche of macro-financial aid conditional on compliance with the commitments made by the donors. Now, listening to Commissioner Solbes, I understand that this commitment should have been taken with moderation. Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement. Are you confirming or not the agreement accepted by your services in the Committee on Budgets, or are you toning down this condition, which would mean breaking the commitment made to us? No, Mr Bourlanges, I think it is a fundamental problem, relating to the way in which we formally conclude the compromise that we have accepted. I have made a proposal and I repeat it: the Commission will state the following in the Council decision: ""The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo's external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors."" In this way, we believe we are fully respecting what has been concluded. I simply ask the Commission, before releasing the second tranche, to inform the Committee on Budgets. I fully agree. It will be done. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00. ALTENER The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - ALTENER (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD)). Mr President, although I am not present in the Chamber, I would like to thank Mr Langen for his commitment to getting this programme through both Parliament and the Council."	it
The events of recent years have certainly heightened awareness of the threats to food safety and human health and given cause for concern. Parliament's prompt response must undoubtedly be seen by all citizens as the most important guarantee for the future, for you, as Members of Parliament, have thereby established a framework for food quality to which the Member States must adhere. However, even in this crucial area of administration, Parliament is aware of the principle of subsidiarity and calls on the Member States to assume and live up to their responsibilities. With Agenda 2000, I believe we are placing emphasis on policies of direct concern to citizens, such as food safety, water quality, environmental protection, and rural development. If we implement this agenda with commitment and determination, the first years of the new millennium will become a milestone in the implementation of policies that are close to the people and reflect the needs of the Community. I particularly welcome the proposed new, strict approval procedures for additives in animal feed. Anyone who demonstrably violates these rules must be severely punished. I pay tribute to Mr. Byrne, the new Commissioner responsible for food safety. He has a difficult task, but he has responded quickly and effectively to the demands of this House and to the concerns of consumers. I am particularly pleased that my home country, Ireland, is leading the way in implementing the new food legislation based on the principle of traceability. This will establish Ireland as a center of excellence for the food production of the future. Mr. President, Commissioner, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work and, in particular, express my satisfaction at the unanimity that prevailed within the group on this point. It is therefore envisaged that the Commission will replace the current authorisations by regulation with authorisations linked to the person responsible for placing the additive in question on the market, and that this will happen simultaneously for all the additives concerned. It is necessary to restore a coherent legal framework. As early as October 1999, the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis for replacing authorisations in Directive 70/524/EEC. However, we must ensure that no distortions of competition arise, as Mr Kindermann and Ms Auroi have already stressed. In my opinion, clear labelling of genetically modified feed additives is necessary to ensure that the final consumer has the choice and is guaranteed to choose a food containing or without GMOs. Consumers must be able to make a free, informed decision. This proposal has no financial implications for the Community budget, Commissioner. Therefore, there must be complete transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety. I am convinced that the Commission can agree with the rapporteur, who – I would remind you – was unanimously supported in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Mr President, since the BSE era, we in this House have repeatedly said that animal nutrition is one of the most important and primary elements for the safe production of food, for the health and protection of consumers. We are therefore pleased that the Commission is presenting a proposal on feed additives.	de
"Question No. 6 (H-0122/00): Subject: Ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo. Since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU, arguing that it was intended to prevent the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo Albanians by Serbs, and since the deployment of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200,000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 killed. This ethnic cleansing is therefore far more 'thorough' than that carried out by the Serbs. In recent days, Serbs have once again been murdered with impunity by members of Kosovo Albanian mafia groups. What decision will the Council take to put an end to this ethnic cleansing once and for all and to guarantee respect for human rights for the entire population of Kosovo, regardless of race or creed? Mr. President, forgive me, but when you hear the Council representative talk like that, you really wonder how far the hypocrisy, the permissiveness, and the complicity have gone. In the house of the hanged man, they don't talk about the rope, as the saying goes. Yugoslavia was a peaceful country, a guarantor of stability and peace. After the interventions of NATO and, initially, Germany, the events we know about occurred. So, it is not the government in Belgrade that is responsible, but NATO; the imperialists and their interventions are responsible. What is the situation today? UN Security Council Resolution 1244 was disregarded in every respect, which proves that it was a trap. 350,000 Serbs, Gypsies, and members of other nationalities besides the Kosovo Albanians have been expelled, 900 murdered, and 800 kidnapped. Eight months later, the Security Council resolution is still being brutally violated. For example, not only was the KLA not disarmed within three months, as the resolution actually stipulated, but contrary to Mr. Kouchner's claims in the European Parliament, it was equipped with modern equipment and designated the ""Kosovo Protection Corps."" Finally, since the Minister mentioned Mr. Kouchner, I would like to point out that, with his 25 orders, he also disregarded Yugoslavia's sovereignty and the Security Council resolution. He introduced a separate currency, his own judiciary... (The President interrupted the speaker.) Let's face the facts, Mr. President. I would like to thank the Minister for his answer, but also recall that, statistically, more violence is being committed in Kosovo today than before the NATO bombings. It is worrying that the bombings have exacerbated the situation, and it should be acknowledged that NATO and the European Union were wrong in taking this measure. The Minister was quite right – and I agree with him – to speak about Belgrade's guilt, but we must not forget that the intelligence services of the US, Germany, France, Italy, and Great Britain supplied weapons and money to the KLA, a mafia, to contribute to the problems in this region. Therefore, we are all guilty. I would like to ask you a follow-up question because of its relevance to the overall context. Don't you think it would be beneficial to lift the blockade against Serbia so that there is greater economic normality in the region, and Kosovo, as a province of Serbia, also benefits from this?"	de
This is certainly something that benefits everyone. To ensure that the Treaty is respected and that we support what has been described as the Community machinery, we are taking the measures we presented yesterday in our statement. And we will continue to do so, Madam President, impartially. It is our duty. It is also a matter of conviction. My final point is this: we understand the context of this fundamental debate. There are several people here who, like me, have grown accustomed over many years to Herr Haider's offensive statements, to the xenophobia of many elements of his policy, and to the strategy he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies, sometimes on successive days. We understand that, and we also remember his sometimes short and selective memory of Nazism. And when we remember that, like many Members of all stripes in this House, my instinct and that of my colleagues is naturally awakened. But the Commission must act on the basis of values and laws, not solely on the basis of instinct. And that is the basis of the conclusion we reached yesterday morning. We therefore support that conclusion while continuing to defend values and the law. Without fragility, without complacency, without ambiguity, but in the service of the entire Union and of each of the Union's Member States and their peoples. We will continue to do so energetically and consistently and, as Mr. Cox said in the debate, we will maintain close vigilance. Given that Mr. Da Costa is listening to these remarks from the back of the House, I wonder if Mr. Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr. Da Costa today and in the recent Presidency statement on behalf of the Heads of State and Government. Does the Commission support the Council? (EN) Madam President, when the Commission said yesterday morning that it takes note of the views expressed in a joint statement by 14 Member States and that it shares the concerns that gave rise to that opinion, I think we can assume that since yesterday morning, as soon as it was able to address the issue, the Commission has maintained an opinion consistent with that of 14 of the Member States. Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock. I believe we have just had a great political debate, commensurate with the situation and what we could have expected. I thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The debate on problems of topicality, urgency, and particular importance is now closed. The vote will take place at 11:00. Recourse to the precautionary principle. In accordance with the agenda, the Commission now makes a statement on recourse to the precautionary principle. (EN) To begin with, I wish to say that I am pleased to introduce this communication on recourse to the precautionary principle, which was drafted in collaboration with Mr. Byrne and Mr. Liikanen. The precautionary principle is not a new concept.	es
Indeed, these programs have been important elements of participatory democracy, of the citizen-led approach to Europe. For all these reasons, the LEADER+ concept must retain all the positive aspects of previous programs. Consequently, a compelling question arises: after ten years of success for these programs, why continue to limit LEADER+ to an experimental role? Are there so many other European initiatives that can boast of having carried out 800 specific, original experiments with notable success? How much longer will the Commission relegate LEADER+ to an experimental role, instead of incorporating it into the general concept of mainstreaming rural development? Furthermore, I have doubts about the limited orientations to which the Commission wants to reduce LEADER+. At a time when, Commissioner, after Seattle, we Europeans are fighting for the multifunctionality of rural development projects, why remain locked into a few reductive criteria, with extremely inadequate resources? This is an environmentalist speaking to you: the precautionary principle and stable development require a much more diversified and multifaceted approach. In this regard, the Commission proposes further reducing the cooperation actions of local action groups, limiting them solely to the countries that are candidates for enlargement. It would be much better to have strengthened coordination between LEADER+ and Community cooperation and partnership programs, such as INTERREG, PHARE, SAPARD, or MEDA, as, incidentally, proposed by the Committee on Regional Policy. Indeed, it is good to show solidarity with Eastern Europe, but it is not enough. We must not abandon the tradition established by previous programs with the countries of the South, particularly those in the Mediterranean area. Therefore, once again, we can emphasize that what is lacking in the field of agriculture and rural development is codecision, which would truly allow us to have the necessary means to advance programs of this type, which require cooperation and cross-cutting action. Mr. President, I would like to make a few very brief remarks. We are debating the program period and the orientation of the four Community initiatives without having a single essential and comprehensive evaluation of the previous period available. This is very negative. Generally, the programs and objectives are overly optimistic, yet the results are not always sufficient, and yet the opacity and complexity of the projects often leave a very wide margin for mismanagement and even fraud. The Community initiatives we are discussing can play an important role under certain conditions. But they must not be subjected to the objectives and aspirations of a more general, negative social and economic policy, and must be allowed to develop their independent role. For example, the adaptation of the EQUAL program to the objectives of employability and the flexibilization of labor relations transforms the initiative into a new version of labor agreements. The extension of the LEADER initiative to all areas of the Union carries an even greater danger of marginalizing less-advantaged regions in favor of more developed ones. The INTERREG initiative should include eligible regions, with particular emphasis on border, island, mountainous, and non-mountainous regions such as the province of Arta in Greece, which is exempt from Annex I of the Commission's communication.	es
On all these issues, I will do my best to follow your recommendations. I would also like to highlight the political conclusions, which, incidentally, all Members are already familiar with, but whose main elements I would like to recall. Ladies and gentlemen, significant progress has been made on the path to real convergence, especially in the four cohesion Member States, but also, Mr. Pohjamo, and I say this frankly, in the Objective 2 regions, which have experienced certain delays in their development, particularly with regard to infrastructure. This is the first political point. Second political point: the Structural Funds have made and will continue to make a significant contribution to this convergence process. All the macroeconomic models we work with indicate, for the past decade, that more than a third of the convergence achieved in underdeveloped regions would not have occurred without the Structural Funds. However, I have taken careful note, with regard in particular to the outermost regions, Mrs. Sudre, Mr. Fruteau, and also Mr. Nogueira Román, that you state that much remains to be done—and here is my third point—regarding the plan to improve the content of the employment recovery, the fight against social exclusion, which is particularly serious and unbearable in many of our regions, and the integration of women and young people into the labor market. The fourth political point is the enlargement of the Union: the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions, and also the greatest challenge for cohesion policy in Europe, a point on which Mr. Van Dam has insisted. I would say that in Berlin and in the financial instruments made available to us, what could be a cohesion policy for the first countries that will join us is taking shape. I am thinking in particular of the ISPA, for whose implementation I will be responsible in the coming weeks. As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, we have just launched our new programming, and we are already reflecting together on the impact of the enlargement of the Union on our structural policy. This sixth periodic report, on which Mr. Berend has issued an overall positive assessment, constitutes for us, at least for me, a good basis for reflection. I would therefore like to thank you very sincerely for this contribution to the reflection we have initiated for the next guidelines, as well as for the successful implementation of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006. Thank you very much, Commissioner. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00. (The sitting adjourned at 8:25 p.m.) Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting. The minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed. Are there any objections? Mr. President, I am responding to an invitation made yesterday afternoon by the President of the Assembly to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the minutes.	es
"If it's any consolation, Ireland doesn't have its own channel yet either. Apparently, there are some technical problems that are difficult to solve, but we are working on it. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to clarify this. I'm not sure our Dutch colleagues are fully convinced, because our Irish colleagues also cannot receive a national channel. I think we need to study what should be done to ensure that all our colleagues can access their own channel. I thank you, Mrs. Banotti, and I extend my thanks to the other Quaestors, for the efforts you are going to make in this regard. Madam President, I would like to point out to Mr. Wurtz that the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty is not Commission doctrine, and that, unless proven otherwise, we are not within the scope of Articles 6 and 7. Consequently, Austria has every right to form a government, and the President of the Commission has every right, and even the duty, to express his best wishes to Austria. Mr. Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago, some of his party's colleagues, French communist mayors, were sending bulldozers into immigrant homes in France. Order of Business The next step is the debate on the final draft agenda as established by the Conference of Presidents, in accordance with Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure. a) Sittings of 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Wednesday: President. Since the Council will not be able to attend on Wednesday afternoon, several groups—European People's Party, European Socialists, Liberals, Greens, United Left—have requested that we deal in a single discussion with the Council declaration on the Cyprus question and Mr. Brok's report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta, and that we advance these two items, together with Mr. Swoboda's report, on the agenda. Therefore, for Wednesday, we would have the two Council statements on the coherence of Union policies with development policy and the UN session on ""Human Rights"", followed by the single discussion on Cyprus, and then the opinions of Mr. Swoboda, Mr. Corrie, Ms. Frassoni, and Mr. Knörr Borràs. Who wishes to present this request on behalf of these groups? As no one wishes to speak, I put this request to the vote. (Parliament agreed) Thursday: President.— Regarding current, urgent, and important issues, I have several amendments. Regarding human rights, I have two requests for inclusion: one from the Liberal Group for the subheading entitled ""Cambodia"", and another from the Green Group for the subheading entitled ""Pinochet"". As you know, the section on ""Human Rights"" cannot cover more than five topics. Currently, there are four items listed in the final draft agenda. Therefore, we can only consider one more."	es
In Europe, after the Cadiz disaster or the Urquiola off the Spanish coast in 1976, or the Torrey Canyon disaster in the same year, or so many other cases that have occurred, we really began to legislate in this regard in 1994 and 1995, and especially in recent years. Moreover, in recent years the focus has been fundamentally on passenger transport safety. That is the reality. I believe that a major effort must now be urgently made to address the new problems arising, among other things, from North American legislation, with the safety of the maritime transport of dangerous goods being a top priority. I have raised a number of issues which, if you wish, we can discuss in more detail at a meeting with the committee responsible for this matter, or when I present the concrete initiatives to you in the coming months. My stated intention is that we begin the discussion at the end of March, which also coincides with the Council of Ministers, and that, of course, we already have texts to discuss before the end of the Portuguese Presidency's six-month term. Flags of convenience are a problem, but not the only one. Romania is not a flag of convenience, yet it has a very high rate of incidents during inspections—more so than flags of convenience. Malta and Cyprus have applied to join the Community. We must make our demands on this issue, and this is what will be negotiated. This will force us to rethink the European Union registers and address the famous problem that will certainly arise again: the demand for a Community register. I think this is difficult, but in any case, the registers of the European Union countries must be reviewed. With regard to controls, a highly key issue, as Mr. Hatzidakis said, the first thing we need to do is examine how the existing legislation has worked. Because we already have legislation. According to the information provided to me by the Commission, this legislation is not sufficiently applied in many Member States due to a lack of staff, resources, and inspectors. The problem is not that only 25% are inspected, but how the selection is carried out, how the ships posing the greatest risk are identified: based on the age of the ships or on the flags' risk history. Unfortunately, that 25% is sometimes covered by flags known to meet all the requirements: inspections are faster, and the work is easier to carry out. Therefore, it will be less a question of making changes than of adopting measures to monitor what is already being done, apart from some additional requirements regarding inspections, particularly depending on the age of the various ships. There are also SOLAS (International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), two conventions of the International Maritime Organization that must, in due course, be made compulsory in all EU Member States, and whose application must be monitored. As regards the question of Union inspectors, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies allowing these inspections to be carried out by the Member States, although this does not mean that the Commission does not have to monitor whether the Member States are carrying out their task properly.	de
"If their financial responsibility is compromised, greater control will undoubtedly be exercised. Finally, coordination among maritime authorities is necessary to achieve a kind of European mechanism analogous to the Coast Guard that monitors the coasts of the United States. First of all, I would like to thank the colleagues in my group who deal with the environment and who have addressed this problem together with the team in charge of transport. This disaster is as much an environmental disaster as it is a transport disaster, and it is not limited to one sector. Once again, we find ourselves in this Parliament debating yet another maritime disaster. I could rattle off the list of disasters that have affected that industry in the 10 years I have been in this Parliament, but I only have three minutes. There is no doubt that it is time not only for the Member States, but also for that toothless tiger called the International Maritime Organization, and for the oil companies and shipowners—who bear no less responsibility—to assume their responsibilities by taking measures to put an end to these ecological and human tragedies that are repeated year after year. How many more Erikas must we endure before those in power provide us with proper and effective port State control throughout the European Union, not just in certain areas? How much more pollution must we endure before the industry provides us with vessels with segregated tanks and double hulls? How many more seabirds must die before shipping companies stop cleaning their tanks at sea, which, as our resolution points out, causes more pollution than any Erika-type disaster? While I recognize that some progress has been made in areas such as port State control and minimum crew regulations, we are still facing what our late colleague Ken Stewart called ""ships of shame entering and leaving our EU waters: rusty buckets and poorly crewed people."" Member States need to act quickly and decisively. Our governments need to provide the financial resources necessary to provide us with effective control and also to stop dragging their feet on the issue of maritime safety. The Erika has not claimed human lives, but it may have ruined the livelihoods of many people. Just like the Sea Empress, just like the Braer. There is no doubt that all three left us with an ecological disaster. My group expresses its condolences to the people of Brittany who have seen their area ravaged by this disaster, as it has also expressed on previous occasions to the people of West Wales and the Shetland Islands. Is it not time we stopped expressing condolences and started issuing requests to rid these vessels of shame for the sake of the safety of the seas? Otherwise, later this year we will be debating a new motion for a resolution when another flag-of-convenience tanker sinks and spews its crude oil into the sea."	es
Expressing our solidarity, as the European Parliament, means first and foremost acting to secure the immediate release of emergency aid for families affected by the oil spill and, at the same time, demanding a qualitative strengthening, at European and international levels, of maritime transport safety rules and regulations to establish much more frequent checks and significantly more dissuasive sanctions for offenders. Our proposals relate in particular to the age of oil tankers. Of those checked and found to be in violation last year, 15 were twenty years old or older, some over thirty or even older. This is no longer tolerable. Furthermore, flags of convenience. According to the International Transport Workers' Federation, more than 40 percent of the ships that sank in 1998 flew flags of convenience, a symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings to the detriment of safety. This is no longer tolerable. Finally, the lack of transparency. Every effort is being made to make the chain of responsibilities and the identity of the owners and those who truly make decisions as opaque as possible. This is no longer tolerable. At all these levels, we must achieve real and significant changes, including setting a deadline for compliance with the new standards, including double hulls, under penalty of being prohibited from anchoring in Member States' ports or crossing their territorial waters. We must also achieve greater rigor both in the issuance of seaworthiness certificates and in checking the age and maintenance of vessels. Finally, we must ensure that all those responsible for a catastrophe contribute to repairs. In this case, I am thinking, in particular, of the Total-Fina group. The European Union, Mr. President, can make the same representation to the International Maritime Organization. This will demonstrate its usefulness to a public that this time expects clear and concrete actions. Mr. President, Commissioner, as a representative of the French Atlantic coast, a representative of Vendée, I would like first of all to express the sense of rebellion of the populations who were victims of the Erika oil spill in the face of disasters caused not by a natural catastrophe like the hurricane that just struck us, but by a crime. With urgency, in the face of adversity, a magnificent surge of solidarity has emerged: local solidarity, national solidarity, intergovernmental solidarity. What the affected populations, those who have lost everything, particularly among seafarers and tourism professionals, whose activity is compromised for several years, now expect is not only that the polluters repair the damage they have caused, but also that everything necessary be done to ensure that their current misfortune serves others in the future, preventing the repetition of similar crimes. We are paying—it is more than evident—the price of our negligence. Because our States, with the blessing of the Community, have not seen fit to continue having their own merchant fleets and have allowed rigorous expertise in shipbuilding to disappear, we no longer have clear vessel traceability and we see veritable junk ships sailing our waters under flags of convenience, at the mercy of the short-term interests of multinational companies.	es
"When the treaties enter into force and what their final form will be depends not only on this recommendation but also on implementation by the contracting parties. In the United States, the WIPO Treaty has already become law in the form of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act, and this legislative measure has succeeded in maintaining the delicate balance sought by WIPO. The EU, too, must make progress in its legislation in accordance with the agreements reached within WIPO. It is also worrying that the opinions adopted by the previous Parliament do not support WIPO's balanced system. The opinion on the Copyright Directive at first reading was skewed, and the balance was shifted in a way that is detrimental to Europe. The proposed recommendations do not promote the position of culture in Europe; on the contrary, the amendments introduced by Parliament improve the opportunities for media corporations established in the existing market to restructure their existing market shares of over 80% through rigid and overly extensive copyright regulations. So I'm not talking about Charlotte Cederschiöld's recommendation, which I consider an excellent document, but about the last Parliament's treatment of the issue of copyright. I would also like to thank Ms. Cederschiöld in particular for clearly defining, for example, the term ""cached copies"" in her report. The WIPO Treaty deliberately omitted to address this type of reproduction. If these technical copies are subject to protection, data transmissions will become unnecessarily more expensive and complicated—as the recommendation rightly states. It's as if a postman had to pay a license fee when delivering a book to a consumer. The real advantage of culture is being able to transport art and knowledge safely and easily from the artist directly to the user, the consumer. This new environment is, above all, a tremendous opportunity to create and disseminate culture in a different way than ever before. It is essential to take the interests of all parties into account. Parliament endeavored to do justice to this aspect in its recommendation. Mr. President, First of all, I would like to compliment the rapporteur on her work. The Commission considers that she worked swiftly and accurately. This is not unimportant. The Commission would like to commend the rapporteur. I would like to say at the outset that the Commission agrees with the conclusions in the draft recommendation and therefore supports Parliament's ratification. I would like to stress the importance of both treaties. With the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, we are making progress in the international protection of copyright and related rights, and thus significantly improving the Berne Convention and the Rome Treaties. Both treaties contribute to better protection of works and other things, but also allow public access to content offered on the networks. Both treaties expressly allow the Community to become a party and to have a significant say in the control of this area. The Community's approval of the Treaties is therefore crucial because it demonstrates its commitment to intellectual property rights."	de
The third inconsistency relates to human rights. They claim to want to protect them. Developing countries are encouraged to respect them. They even pass numerous resolutions condemning every violation of them. We also echo the protests and the international campaigns. Yet, at the same time, the arms trade is allowed to develop, without even bothering to limit the trade in the most atrocious weapons: anti-personnel mines, for example. Nor is much done to truly prevent human rights violations. The fourth inconsistency in the European Union's cooperation policy is this: how can they hope to help development by plundering the natural resources of the countries they help? The European Union must leave its fish to local fishermen to feed local populations, instead of systematically destroying the seabed with its intensive fishing. Raw materials must be left to local producers for processing. Let's not even talk about oil, since we are unfortunately familiar with the policies of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa. To go further, and this will perhaps be the fifth inconsistency, we call for respect for biodiversity, among other reasons to allow everyone to produce with their own seeds and preserve natural wealth. However, at the same time, and we saw this again during the recent negotiations, ACP countries are being forced to sign the TRIPS agreements, when these agreements risk being extended to living organisms. This extension would therefore mean the death of biodiversity and a return to de facto slavery for small farmers in the South at the mercy of multinationals. On the other hand, and this is a sixth inconsistency, the implementation of the existing Treaties is not defended. Thus, on the one hand, a budget allocation is being voted for the fight against AIDS, and on the other, nothing is being done to enforce compulsory licensing within the framework of the aforementioned TRIPS, which would therefore allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and stem the catastrophe caused by AIDS. Similarly, during the WTO negotiations, and when the Schwaiger report noted, in its second section, that large sectors of the population in developing countries, especially the poorest, barely benefit from the current process of trade liberalization, the European Union continues to defend trade liberalization and, admittedly, ends, after a few years of transition, the favorable regime granted to ACP countries when it should have been strengthened, especially for the poorest countries. The eighth inconsistency is political and practical. It is always said: think globally and act locally. However, local development agents are neglected, preferring to argue with national governments and subsidize Northern NGOs at the expense of local programs of Southern NGOs. Agriculture and the environment are other issues, other inconsistencies that could also have been mentioned, without forgetting research, emigration, and health. In short, the goal is to help developing countries while simultaneously encouraging market liberalization, even though it is recognized that this goes against that goal.	es
What should be done with this money? Human rights deserve special mention. The West has fought for human rights in Kosovo. What is happening now in the region? The mass expulsions orchestrated by the Serbs have ended, but despite this, unacceptable situations occur practically every day in which people are killed or prevented from living where and how they want. Attacks against Serbs, Roma, and Bosnians are reported every day, while attacks against Albanians continue. I was actually appalled by the news, if true, that an Albanian doctor, who undoubtedly worked in very difficult conditions at the hospital in the Serbian part of Mitrovica, was forced to stop treating his people there because he received constant death threats. These incidents and situations we cannot tolerate. I have received news—I don't know if it's true or not—that Serbs continue to exploit a mine in Kosovo, on the Serbian side. Rumor has it that Serbian militias are still active. It makes no difference to me whether it's a Serb, a Roma, a Bosnian, or an Albanian who receives threats or is killed in Kosovo. It makes no difference to me who tries to divide and separate Kosovo. What matters to me is that the bodies we fund achieve what we want to achieve, namely, a multiethnic Kosovo, a Kosovo of coexistence. We need more police forces, since the current forces are insufficient. We need an independent judiciary—which is extremely difficult—and we also need resources for the High Commissioner for Human Rights. All of this must be done, and the sooner the better. If we delay providing aid, the situation will worsen, with the risk of new conflicts and crises erupting. For this reason, I think it is right that we have acted swiftly, that we have recognized the urgent nature of the operation and that we are releasing the funds. However, we want to see actions and we also want to see results in Kosovo. Therefore, I ask the Commission to ensure that the money is used for effective purposes, especially for organizing the police and the justice system. Mr. President, first of all, thank you very much to the honourable Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which you have dealt with this issue. It will undoubtedly allow us to release the funds to Kosovo quickly and address the concerns that both Mr. Swoboda and Ms. Pack have raised. In tonight's debate, I believe I can discern three fundamental types of concern. First, although much progress has been made, and we could refer to customs administration, banking administration, and tax administration, it is true that we must move forward. Move forward to finance what? There we have the first point of some disagreement. In some of your amendments, you propose that the types of entities eligible for EU funding be more limited. For example, in Amendments 3 and 5.	es
This is certainly the best boost we can give to democracy in Europe. If, in this way, we abandon the culture of the 1950s and embark on the new century, we will be able to say that we have had a very fine time. Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Michiel Van Hulten on his first report. It was a real hazing, but, as popular wisdom says, the best way to learn to swim is to jump right in. Dear colleague, after such an ordeal, I think you can qualify for the Olympic Games! In my opinion, two points deserve the particular attention of my group. First, there is the individual responsibility of Commissioners. This point must be settled at the Intergovernmental Conference. We certainly do not want this important issue to be left entirely to the discretion of the Council. We have therefore tabled an amendment asking whether it would not be possible to reach an agreement between the Commission and Parliament so that we have a kind of retirement position rather than leaving our fate in the hands of the Council. The second point, which my colleague, Mr Mulder, has already mentioned, is that, according to the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, Parliament should also be scrutinised by independent experts. This would go a long way towards restoring the confidence of European citizens in our institution. We can only be both a credible opponent and a credible partner of the reformed Commission if we acknowledge our wrongdoings and put our house in order within the European Parliament. Only by reforming all the European institutions will we achieve the democratic, dynamic and transparent Europe that our citizens deserve. Mr President, I too would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr van Hulten, on the first piece of work he is presenting to the House. I am convinced that this will serve him, among other things, to make his second report more flexible and to seek greater consensus among the different groups. The process of reforming the Commission, which citizens are demanding, cannot now be postponed. This Parliament has heard on numerous occasions, including from Commission presidents, the desire for reform. Now it seems that this is becoming more serious. After the resignation of a Commission and the highlighting of an almost unlimited number of shortcomings by a committee of experts, Mr Prodi's promise on 14 September to present a comprehensive reform plan to this House by February is logical. Parliament is anxiously awaiting this comprehensive reform program. The report we are now debating attempts to give political force to many of the recommendations of the committee of experts appointed by this Parliament. Mr. Prodi stated that he would act in any case, that he would of course prefer to succeed, but that the fear of not achieving his goal would not prevent him from acting. Therefore, we ask that his program be courageous, because, if it is, I can assure him that Parliament will be on the Commission's side in this reform process.	fr
Mr. President, I too would like to begin by thanking Corrie for her excellent report, which, in my opinion, adequately describes and summarizes the work carried out at the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1999. My time is short, and I want to address two issues. The first concerns the fight against poverty, which, in my opinion, is beginning to become an embarrassing story for both the EU and the Member States. Despite our commitments, both in the Treaty and at the UN meetings in Rio and Copenhagen, to work to end poverty, in reality, cuts are being made to development aid budgets, contrary to what has been said to be done. This trend must be halted. We must start by canceling debts. We must start putting action behind words. I would like us to play a major role in this work. The other issue is that, on many occasions, we say that the ACP countries must learn the fundamentals of democracy. Points 2 and 3 of the resolution call for the development and improvement of working methods within the framework of the new convention. ACP countries will be urged to allow many political parties to express their views. In my opinion, this is very good, and I fully support it. However, we must also ask ourselves how we ourselves understand democracy. How does it work in the European Parliament's Delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Assembly? Contrary to how things work here in the European Parliament and in parliamentary committees, where rapporteurs are proposed and appointed for reports, there are no rules in this Delegation to the Joint Assembly. The two main groups share all the reports between them. To change this undemocratic situation, the Greens/European Free Alliance (ALE) Group has tabled Amendment 6. In it, we call for the rapporteurs of general reports and reports, in addition to the members of working groups, to be appointed according to clear and democratic rules. In this context, we must take into account the small groups and their representativeness. Mr. President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, I would first like to congratulate our colleague Mr. Corrie on the quality of his report, which accurately reflects the content of the debates in the Joint Assembly, whose Co-Chairman he effectively assumed. The eradication of poverty has been the central theme of our work, and to achieve this ambitious goal, many speakers drew attention to the need to preserve a fundamental tool: I am referring to the preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries, within the framework of the Lomé Conventions. This was a considerable challenge. Globalization, trade liberalization, as well as the preeminence of the WTO and the globalist philosophy it embodies, threatened the very essence of North-South dialogue.	es
We must put an end to the cascade of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners, and complacent certification societies at all costs. However, today we are immersed in the greatest confusion. These issues must be addressed—it is abundantly clear—at the global level, but the current IMO international standards are highly inadequate and much more lax, and neither our countries nor the Community have made any effort to make them more rigorous, despite recent catastrophes. It is true that the International Oil Pollution Fund (IOPF) exists, but it dilutes responsibilities and its level of requirements is totally inadequate, and it must be reviewed. The issue of flags of convenience within the IMO framework must be reviewed urgently. It is up to the Member States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to this end. I must recall that the Erika flew the flag of convenience of a candidate State for accession to the Union. On the other hand, Community directives exist, but they are not implemented or are poorly implemented due to a lack of sufficient national controllers. This shortcoming must be remedied urgently. A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but it is moving very slowly. From this perspective, there is unacceptable inertia and an unacceptable shortcoming on the part of the Commission. The date for presenting the Commission communication on this essential issue, perpetually postponed and now scheduled for July, must be brought forward. As for the substantive provisions to be established, they must be particularly clear and strict. I will mention three that our group considers to be priorities. First, the liability of oil cargo owners must be clearly established, and victims of pollution must be able to unambiguously bring legal action against those responsible. The best prevention for the future is for charterers to know that if they are not extraordinarily vigilant about the safety of the vessels they choose, they will receive severe civil, criminal, and financial penalties. Secondly, the requirement for double hulls for oil tankers allowed to sail in Community waters must be imposed as quickly as possible and should not be left to the Greek calends. Thirdly, a strict age limit for vessels allowed to sail in Community waters must be quickly established. This could be fifteen years at most. If a sufficiently clear, strict, and rigorous Community regulatory framework is not available, Member States that wish to do so should be authorized to do so in order to protect their populations and their territories, just as the United States has been able to draw on the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by requiring double hulls and closing its waters to all vessels over twenty years old. Thus, the United States denied the Erika access to its waters. Had the Community done the same, a huge catastrophe would have been avoided.	es
In the Commission's view, the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must take into account the terms of reference set for it by the Cologne European Council. This does not mean, however, that the Convention should limit itself to a mere codifying function consisting in bringing together rights already existing in various sources. As I have already had occasion to state before this Parliament, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must, where appropriate, be able to adapt and develop these rights in the light of current circumstances, particularly technical and social developments. However, given the mandate and ultimate purpose of the text to be submitted to the Heads of State or Government, this option must be used with caution and only on a case-by-case basis. The rights conferred by this Charter apply to at least two categories of persons. Some are for the benefit of all persons residing in the Union, while others are reserved for Union citizens. It is also conceivable that certain economic and social rights might be granted only to Union citizens and, under certain conditions, to nationals of third countries. At this stage, when the process of drafting the Charter is still in its early stages, it is premature to consider its content in detail. What is certain, however, is that the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for men and women will certainly be among the rights guaranteed by the future Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union, since it is already enshrined in the EU Treaty and secondary legislation and is undoubtedly part of the constitutional traditions common to the Member States. As I have also already stated before this Parliament, the Commission is in favour of incorporating this Charter into the Treaty. However, it is aware that the final decision on this matter rests with the Heads of State or Government. The Convention's task, therefore, is not easy, to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text that can be readily incorporated into the Treaties. In its opinion on the convening of an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties, the Commission points out that the European Council will have to decide in the course of 2000 on the inclusion of certain subjects on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference, in particular the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Commissioner, it is of the utmost importance that, at the beginning of this new century, the citizens of Europe, men and women, are called upon to redefine their rights and responsibilities. We hope that the important decision of the Cologne Council will truly be given effect to. Globalization, on the one hand, and enlargement, on the other, only make the enshrinement of these rights all the more urgent. Seattle has provided an opportunity for serious reflection on many related issues, and we hope that the Nice European Council will not be in vain. However, in order to ensure the participation of citizens in this new project, we would like to know what plan the European institutions, and specifically the European Commission, are proposing for the social and democratic model of Europe in the 21st century. Having heard something of your general approach, I would now like to ask you what place children, as autonomous individuals, have in the European Commission's project for a new model of society for the 21st century. Mr President, Madam Members of Parliament, I must state quite clearly that, in my opinion and in line with what President Prodi said this morning, the drafting of the Charter is a politically very significant process because it demonstrates that the Union places the fundamental rights of its citizens above all other political concerns for the future of our common project.	de
At that time, reflecting the widespread outcry over the disastrous consequences of this disaster, the Council expressed its concern about the safety of oil tankers and the associated environmental protection. The Council was not insensitive to these types of issues and the need to take further action in this area. The importance for the Council of taking further action at Community level, and in its own work with international organizations, was emphasized at the time. As you know, as it currently stands, Community legislation requires port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign vessels, including those flying flags of convenience, and to detain them if they fail to meet international standards. There is a 1995 directive on this subject. Looking to the future, the Council noted that the reflection process currently underway at Commission level should soon result in a communication on oil tanker safety and new proposals aimed at strengthening controls and the qualifications of inspection bodies. It is also planned to strengthen the structures of oil tankers using Community ports. These matters are being monitored by the Council of Transport Ministers, and I can assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we will, in all likelihood, give the highest priority to the proposals that the Commission will present in this area. This seems essential to us in terms of environmental protection. Of course, Parliament will also be called upon to express its opinion on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to codecision. I am pleased that the Council is reflecting on this issue. The President of the Council comes from a country, Portugal, which is directly threatened by a situation of this kind. If we think too hard, by next summer, an oil tanker subjected to such conditions could very well sink off the coast of the Algarve, destroying the Portuguese summer tourist industry and, with a bit of luck, the sea currents could carry this pollution as far as the island of Madeira - because they follow that direction - and, moreover, also destroy tourism in the Canary Islands. Does the President-in-Office of the Council not believe that we should stop thinking and start taking drastic measures in this matter, bearing in mind that today we already have the necessary means to control this type of oil tanker on the high seas? In any case, the story of the Erika is one that seems comical. A French ship, flying the Maltese flag, with an Indian crew, with a navigation certificate issued by Italy, in Sicily, and whose last inspection was, I believe, carried out in Bulgaria. The ship was sinking, the captain saw it clearly and knew that it would not even reach the nearest port. I believe this should not be allowed. The damage could be catastrophic for your country, Mr. President, and for mine too, Spain.	fr
This type of procedure is common practice because programmes or legislative measures are too often endowed with inadequate funding for their ambitions! Böge report (A5-0023/2000) As a Member of the European Parliament, and above all as a citizen-consumer, I welcome the European Commission's proposal, which marks a further step towards improving food safety in the European Union. The proposal is twofold: firstly, it involves amending the 1991 Council Directive on health policy conditions by deleting the provisions relating to scrapie, and secondly, it involves establishing a new regulation laying down provisions for the prevention and control of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species. The positive aspect of the new legislation is that it creates a specific legal basis for the control of scrapie. I am even more pleased as this was one of the main requests contained in the monitoring and evaluation report following the mad cow disease crisis. I also believe it is essential, in the interests of consistency, to merge the existing legislation on trot disease, limited to trade in sheep and goats, into a single mechanism complete with new provisions regulating TSEs affecting all animals in the European Union as a whole, with the aim of preventing the consumption of food products or animal feed. Such regulation is also appropriate because doubts remain about trot disease in sheep. According to some scientific hypotheses, this disease may have evolved to the point of mutating into BSE in cattle and thus be the cause of the BSE epizootic. Beyond the clarifications and strengthening that are necessary, in particular with regard to the identification and control of scrapie, the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down provisions for the prevention and control of certain TSEs represents a significant improvement. It is a guarantee for European citizens who have repeatedly expressed their concerns about European food policy, concerns which, taken up by the European Parliament, have been listened to. The discussions on the precautionary principle, traceability, responsibility and transparency have led the European Commission to present a White Paper on food safety, which offers various points for reflection and in particular has proposed the creation of an independent European Food Authority. All this is part of a European strategy aimed at regaining consumer confidence. It is up to us as European leaders to demonstrate that the single market and the free movement of goods can be combined with food safety! Cederschiöld report (A5-0008/2000) Mr President, I voted in favour of this measure on the reorganisation of legislation on copyright because I believe that this is one of the most important areas in which the European Parliament operates. I am of the opinion that the product of the intellect is much more important than buildings, than tangible products, which we can see and touch, while from intellect and science, which cannot be touched with our hands, come results of great importance that we, as the European Community, should support much more actively, not only through the protection of patents but by granting concessions and support to scientists, to those who - taking advantage of the teachings received - work to give future generations something much more important than what we have had in the past.	it
For this reason, we support Amendments 78 and 79, which outline minimum secure standards on wiretapping and videoconferencing. On the one hand, we are eagerly awaiting the outcome of this vote in order to prevent this entire agreement—which, I repeat, already establishes minimum standards—from being emptied of any content. On the other hand, we are in favor of awaiting any proposals that may come from the Commission so that this minimum Community law can finally be drawn up. Mr. President, there is no doubt that, in the face of the growing phenomenon of organized crime on an international scale, Member States should cooperate with each other as much as possible, or rather, the institutional conditions should be established to launch a concrete and effective process of cooperation in the judicial field. A process that, however, must go through all the necessary stages to avoid untimely overriding of legitimate national indications in matters of justice, over which Member States are sovereign, and above all to avoid overriding of measures that end up disregarding the fundamental rights of citizens. Consequently, it is necessary to proceed with caution with a text like the Council's, which, as the rapporteur has also emphasized, after years of debate, now seeks to resolve everything in a very few months. Furthermore—and I share Mr. Di Pietro's assessments—the Council's text even seems too rich in contradictions, incoherent wording, and gaps. Obviously, justice, more than any other sector, cannot be treated in an incoherent and contradictory manner. In our group's opinion, the report as a whole also seems highly questionable, despite the introduction of some corrective amendments sensitive to the protection of personal freedoms and respect for national sovereignty. The report addresses overly heterogeneous subjects, lacks gradation, and proceeds by approximation. In conclusion, we will vote against this report, reiterating that the Europe we desire must be a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that require gradual and responsible reflection, as well as very serious in-depth analysis. First, we must establish the general rules and institutional certainties, and only then can we proceed to the establishment of practical agreements. Mr. President, on behalf of the Members of the Bonino List, I wish to confirm the position we held in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and consequently, I also announce the vote on behalf of our Members: a vote against this report, or rather, a vote against the Convention on which the report is based. Nevertheless, I would like to thank and commend the rapporteur for his work, who listened very carefully to what we discussed in committee, particularly regarding the issue of the right to a defense, both at the national level and in the area of European legal assistance cooperation in criminal matters. The committee and the rapporteur have accepted nine of the eleven amendments we tabled, which are based specifically on the right to a defense.	es
I have not yet heard of any arguments suggesting that the Commission should extend this deadline. Secondly, we maintain regular contact with the Swedish government. I can inform Mr. Andersson that I will travel to Stockholm on Monday, March 6, to hold talks with Minister Ringholm, with members of the Swedish Parliament, and possibly also with the Prime Minister or other ministers, to further discuss this matter, which—I am fully aware of this—is of enormous political interest in Sweden. Thirdly, I naturally understand the importance of the health aspect in this regard. I would like to reiterate that, according to Professor Lindgren of Lund University, alcohol consumption in Sweden will remain constant, whatever the outcome of import restrictions. Then, of course, the question arises as to where the quantities of alcohol not imported by travelers come from. The answer is that this alcohol is smuggled or produced by the Swedes themselves. I need not point out to you, Mr. Andersson, how extremely dangerous and harmful this process is. Well then, Mr. Andersson obviously thinks that health will improve if we restrict alcohol imports. In that case, not only Sweden, but all countries in the European Union would have to start from the principle of banning all sales of alcohol. The United States has set an example of this. Mr. Andersson will be familiar with what was then called prohibition. And he also knows how it affected mafia activities in the United States, where the prohibition was eventually repealed. All I'm saying is that health must, of course, be protected, but not with an alcohol ban, because that achieves nothing. Mr. President, the reality is that it's about the revenue from the Swedish alcohol monopoly, and when the Swedish government says it has to use it to cover health costs, that is proof that it is a distortion of competition, because other countries have to finance their own health costs without having an alcohol monopoly. My question is whether you are aware of any studies that show that moderate consumption of high-quality alcohol, such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer, is actually beneficial to health and would therefore even ease the burden on the Swedish state budget. If I understood Mr. Posselt correctly, he is referring to the fiscal aspects of this matter. As far as I know, the high taxes on alcoholic beverages in Sweden date back to 1638, and since then, the state has derived a significant portion of its tax revenue from the sale of alcoholic beverages. As is well known, Sweden currently holds a state monopoly, which in itself is not in compliance with EU law. Now, as far as the healing effects of alcohol are concerned—which, I believe, is what Mr. Posselt was talking about—I can wholeheartedly agree with him: In my opinion, a good bottle of wine can be extremely beneficial to health and, in company, can also certainly lift one's spirits. Perhaps Mr Posselt, Mr Andersson and myself can meet at the Parliament bar for a glass of aquavit in the next few days.	de
These are the consequences! Therefore, we can only call on the Commission to continue its appeasing efforts and to pay tribute to those who are committed to preserving the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people and are doing everything possible to ensure that this people remains free and continues to show solidarity with other peoples. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate is marked by hypocrisy: the Council is disregarding the Treaty and is applying a procedure that is absolutely not covered by Articles 6 and 7, which allow a country to be condemned in the event of serious and repeated violations. In the present case, there are no serious and repeated violations by Austria. There are risks—we are all aware of this—but at present there are absolutely no violations, neither serious nor repeated. If the criteria of Articles 6 and 7, the Copenhagen criteria—which the countries of Eastern Europe are required to comply with—were applied to our institutions, to the European Union, then this European Union would almost certainly not be able to become a member. When it comes to serious and repeated violations, perhaps we should mention specific Member States such as Italy and France, the country most and third most frequently condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg Court, respectively. We should, dear colleagues from Belgium, speak of the Dutroux affair, of the many children who have been kidnapped, abused, raped, and murdered by prominent figures in that country, and of the relevant proceedings that produce no results and always fizzle out. Dear colleagues, with a third of the Members of Parliament, we could force the Council and the Commission to address this. We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are resisting a party rule that has corrupted and depraved their country for ten or thirteen years, but which is also depraving and driving Italy, Belgium, and other member states of the Union into corruption. We should really be asking ourselves, ladies and gentlemen, why 76% of Belgians have absolutely no confidence in their country's justice system, why 56% of French people have absolutely no confidence in their justice system, why 53% of Italians have absolutely no confidence in their justice system... (The President cut off the speaker.) Madam President, my group, the EDD, and my party in particular, are deeply affected by this debate. We cannot and do not support Mr Haider's views and policies in any way. We deplore his references to the Third Reich. But we also deplore the fact that Parliament intends to interfere in the policies of an elected government of a country, especially when that country is part of the European Union. My party at home is certainly not racist, but we do not particularly like the European Union dictating to us or interfering either. Will you interfere in the British Parliament if we are elected? Madam President, the Austrian people voted and elected Mr Haider to their Parliament. I believe Mr Haider received 28% of the vote, so there will be a coalition government.	de
"We not only regret the events in Austria, we are upset and deeply disappointed. We call on the ÖVP to ultimately consider other solutions. We repeatedly return to Article 6 of the Treaty. We continue to fight against the trivialization of the extreme right. Should the coalition nevertheless come into being, we appeal to our colleagues in the ÖVP to guarantee, both in their programs and in word and deed, respect for the principles and values that form the foundation of European integration. Austria faces a great responsibility. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is obvious that we in this Parliament largely agree in our rejection of Haider and his policies, but it is equally clear that we have different views on how these policies can be most effectively combated. Have you ever asked yourself what impact this debate here and the Council Presidency's statement last weekend are having in Austria itself? Have you ever asked yourselves whether we are not also responsible for how the political situation in Austria develops if we presume to judge it here? Have you ever asked yourself what would happen if a colleague's wish were granted and elections were held in Austria in the next few days? According to all observers, Haider would become even stronger. Who could want that? Don't we have a responsibility to consider how we combat this policy? Europe is a community based on the rule of law. The principles we must uphold include democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. Part of the democratic precept is that one may not approve of electoral decisions but must respect them, and therefore we must respect them when Austrians decide the way they do for reasons inherent in their politics. It is a matter of the rule of law that the Council Presidency does not express itself in the way it did, in a way that contradicts the treaties. It is a matter of political wisdom not to isolate the ÖVP, but rather to support the ÖVP, as an undoubtedly democratic, constitutional, and clearly European party, in ensuring that Austria remains just as undoubtedly a member of this European Community. Therefore, our ÖVP colleagues must have our support in this difficult situation, and isolation is absolutely the wrong approach! (Applause) Madam President, at home, we say, ""a Welshman needs three attempts,"" and three times, as you will have noticed in the course of this debate, I have expressed the wish to briefly address this excellent and at times moving debate. First of all, on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission, I would like to thank a number of Members of this House for the support and understanding that a number of Members of this House have shown for the Commission's position, which we expressed in our statement yesterday. I must, of course, also respond to the fact that during the debate—and I will resort to some of the terms used—there has been talk of the Commission's ambiguity, complacency, and cautious behavior."	de
Food safety therefore requires complete transparency for producers and consumers. I am convinced that the Commission will be able to follow the path indicated by the rapporteur, who, let us not forget, obtained unanimity in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Mr President, since the time of BSE, it has been repeated in this House that animal feed is one of the fundamental elements for safe food production, for safeguarding health and protecting consumers. We therefore welcome the proposal presented by the Commission on additives for animal feed. The committee on whose behalf I speak, namely the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture in his capacity as rapporteur would have produced an excellent report, decided in December to withdraw its opinion. Nevertheless, I would like to make a few comments and take a position on a few points. Firstly, on the question of the legal basis. Even though we have a new regulation in this Parliament - and it may well be that, given the ambitions of the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, there will increasingly be problems of competence in legislative matters between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment - in cases of conflict of this kind, I believe that one thing must always be borne in mind: the cohesion of this Parliament is decisive and the legal basis is, in my view, fundamental. Therefore - and I cannot help but reiterate, Commissioner Byrne - I condemn the choice of legal basis. Even though it is only a legal basis taken from previous directives, it is a mistake to retain it. The Treaty of Amsterdam is extremely clear on this point: if human health is involved, the legal basis to be chosen is Article 152. I must point out to the Legal Affairs Committee of this Parliament that it is not enough to examine the Commission's proposal and note that health and consumer protection are not mentioned. Therefore, the political group to which I belong - as Mr Kindermann has already said - will vote in favour of the change of legal basis tomorrow and I hope that the other political groups will do the same. Commissioner Byrne, for the sake of transparency and positive cooperation, I urge you to welcome and approve the change of legal basis. Otherwise, if we follow the indications of the Legal Affairs Committee, we will be opening the door to manipulation. By leaving the choice of legal basis to the Commission on the basis of the fact that health protection policy is not mentioned in the text, Article 37 has been used. Allow me to briefly touch on two more points. As regards genetically modified microorganisms in feed, I think it is unacceptable to refer to vertical legislation and say that sooner or later other rules will be needed. At the moment we do not have them! Therefore, in the absence of different legislation, every time we approve rules we must also deal with genetically modified organisms, mention them expressly and insist that they are declared on the label. This is what the rapporteur did and it is a positive indication.	it
"On the other hand, if the new round of negotiations of the World Trade Organisation were to begin during the Portuguese Presidency - which is not at all certain - we will of course ensure that the presence of Community production on international markets is consolidated and that there is a greater balance between Community agricultural exports and the preservation of the multifunctional European agriculture I have just mentioned. The Portuguese Presidency will also attach great importance to the deepening of food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Minister for Foreign Affairs, and President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, has already referred to this aspect here this morning. The role of food safety, insofar as it is linked in particular to public health, is a fundamental element that our Presidency must develop and is, moreover, one of the priorities of our programme. We will develop it along four parallel lines, within the ""Consumer Protection"" Council and the ""Internal Market"" Council. The Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this matter to the European Council in Santa Maria da Feira, which will be held in June this year, particularly in the light of what the Commission set out a few days ago in its White Paper. We believe that the work to be done on this basis for the establishment of a European agency is essential to give credibility to the internal market, to consolidate confidence in this market, to resolve some of the tensions that have arisen between Member States in this area and also - why not say it - to define a common attitude of the European Union in relations with third countries in areas that are linked to food safety. This is the objective that we intend to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope, in the end, to be able to present the result of our efforts to this House. I thank the President-in-Office for his response. I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat posed to the European model based on family farms, especially for farmers in the beef and sheep meat sector who should now sell their products at prices equal to or lower than production costs. I would like to ask what new initiatives the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the upcoming world trade talks, in particular against the type of production practised on ranches and farms in the United States and New Zealand, where economies of scale make it extremely difficult for European farmers to compete with the production methods applied on their farms, and where, of course, European food safety standards are not applied. I fully understand your concerns and I realise how much more effort and more coherence is needed in this respect, including within the European Union. We also need to think about the consequences, especially in terms of financing and compensation for farmers. However, as you know, this is a matter for the European Commission and it will be up to the Commission to take it forward. The Council has limited capacity to intervene in this area. Mr President, I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council to the Chamber."	it
"Commissioner: Andalusia is not Lapland. I would like to hear the Commissioner's opinion on Amendment 45. It may have slipped my mind when she announced the list. (EN) I accept the amendment. Thank you very much, Mrs. Wallström. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11:30. Financial instrument for the environment (Life) The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A4-0014/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, concerning the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financial instrument for the environment (Life) (Rapporteur: Mrs. Lienemann). (FR) Mr. President, we have already had the opportunity to examine that report at first reading, and in committee I understood that there was a broad consensus within this House. LIFE is the only budget line for direct intervention in environmental matters included in the Community budget, and it must be acknowledged that it falls short of our ambitions, as the amounts allocated to it have remained frozen for several years. Despite the increase that took place when we renewed the first LIFE program to move to the second, the appropriations were maintained as they were. It turns out that, increasingly, regions, various operators, companies, and associations are submitting LIFE projects for both LIFE-NATURE and LIFE-ENVIRONMENT. These projects are of very high quality, as, after being submitted to the relevant committees, they all agree that they would merit European Union support, yet we cannot fund them due to a lack of budget allocations. We must also remember that the rate of consumption of appropriations in this budget is exceptional within the Community budget. It is therefore clear that this is a tool very well adapted to the policies we wish to pursue. I will place particular emphasis on the area of LIFE-Nature. We know that a series of directives relating to ""Habitats"" and ""Migratory Birds"" are encountering difficulties in their implementation in the European Union: with LIFE-NATURE, we should be able to support policies that demonstrate the feasibility, legitimacy, and capacity to achieve the objectives set by these directives. And we are losing that legitimacy due to a lack of funding, allowing the idea to spread that our European directives are neither reasonable nor enforceable. The debates taking place today focus on two major issues: first, comitology, a perennial debate within our Assembly. However, our Parliament wanted to implement policies that are resolved more through management committees and advisory committees, which provide a certain degree of flexibility to the Commission and limit the Council's power to block and, I would say, enforce intergovernmental philosophy over the Community philosophy of which we are guarantors here in the European Parliament. But these debates about comitology arise with respect to most of the European Union's financial programs and financial instruments. It seems to me—and the contacts we've had tend to demonstrate this—that it's easier to reconcile points of view on comitology than on the budget."	es
I also propose that the withdrawal of salmon showing clinical signs of the disease should be immediate. The procedures already existing in Community legislation for the introduction of additional control measures will be used to introduce the withdrawal plans; these plans will be based on the actual health conditions of the salmon in order to minimise the possible environmental impact. In this respect I accept Amendments Nos 7 and 8, the latter with a slight modification. I also support Amendment No 9, but I think it needs to be better worded to also include environmental issues and disease eradication and control strategies. I do not think I can accept Amendments Nos 12 and 13 as they seem to me to be aimed at zeroing the risk. I believe that this objective is very difficult to achieve without causing the closure of farms in the sector. I would like to know the Parliament's opinion on these amendments and whether it thinks this approach is the best way forward. I can also partially accept Amendment No 13. 11. Finally, I would like to stress that we will continue to strive to maintain a high level of public health protection in accordance with our Treaty obligations. I believe that moving forward we must propose measures in line with this objective. We will continue to work to eradicate the disease, for the benefit of both the environment and the salmon industry. I would be extremely grateful if Parliament would recognise our efforts by accepting this proposal. Thank you, Commissioner Byrne. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00. Protection of juvenile fish The next item is the debate on report A5-0035/2000 by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 1624/94 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean and amending for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 1624/94 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean. 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (COM(1999)552 - C5-0040/2000 - 1999/0222(CNS)). The proposal under consideration, outlined in the introduction, is very important. My colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and in Parliament know that our work on technical conservation measures is based on concrete technical advice. The institution responsible for providing this advice, based on reliable scientific evidence, is the Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). This intergovernmental fisheries organisation, of which the European Union is a member, is responsible for the conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic and adjacent seas, including the Mediterranean. It was established in March 1969 and, although formally required to meet every two years, it meets every year. It takes decisions based on scientific information and then makes recommendations for the conservation of fish resources. ICCAT operates through four permanent committees, made up of national experts, which deal with research and statistics, finance and administration, compliance, and conservation and management measures. There are also four working groups, which deal respectively with tropical tuna, northern temperate tuna, southern temperate tuna and other species.	it
While taking into account the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which provide for its entry into force once at least half of the Member States have adopted the Convention, I would like to call on the Member States to do their utmost to ratify this Convention swiftly. Unfortunately, the experience of past ratifications of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is disappointing. This Convention will not create a new or different system of mutual assistance; it is intended to build on well-established and tried-and-tested mechanisms which have been in operation for a long time, such as those provided for in the 1959 Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance and the Benelux Treaty. The draft drawn up by the Council contains provisions on several issues which have been discussed by many Members of the Parliament. An important achievement of the Convention is that, where possible, Member States to which a request is made comply with all formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting Member State. This is particularly important for the possibility of using the evidence obtained in court. Furthermore, requests can be made directly between competent authorities without having to go through central authorities. Generally speaking, there are two types of provisions: those which impose an obligation to offer assistance - such as the provisions on telephone and videoconferencing, controlled deliveries and the interception of telecommunications - and those which do not impose any obligation but simply establish a legal framework for Member States wishing to cooperate in the prescribed manner - for example, the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert operations and the sending and offering of procedural documents. The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions dealing with new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in combating organised crime, which, by virtue of its location, can take advantage of open borders. It is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations. However, we must not forget an essential aspect of any action on criminal procedures: the rights of the defence. I very much appreciate the fact that the report by Mr Di Pietro, to whom I pay tribute for the excellent work he has done in such a short time, includes defence rights among its key points. At present, it is up to the Member States alone to ensure that these rights are respected under the supervision of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the preparation of which has just begun. We must recognise that Article 18 concerns a clearly controversial decision. The article has been carefully drafted, in the course of lengthy debates in the Council, to ensure the effectiveness of intelligence activities and the inclusion of criminal investigations. As regards criminal investigations, for which I am responsible, I note the call made by several Members of the European Parliament to the Commission and the Council to consider this issue and address it on a common legal basis, given the importance that the interception of telecommunications can have as evidence before the court. The Commission is fully aware that the project before us is neither perfect nor ideal, but we must be realistic.	it
"Additional recommendations on this approach are also contained in the second report of the Committee of Wise Men. Likewise, the Commission, through Mr Barnier and Mr Vitorino, and certain Member States are firmly in favour of it. I urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which was adopted by a large majority by the Committee on Budgetary Control. We can once again demonstrate that this Parliament is active in preventing mismanagement and, in particular, fraud, and in condemning it where necessary. Mr President, I am pleased to be able to speak on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato. I believe that this is a report in which cooperation between the committees has worked very well, and the result, which we have received today, is a sober and calm report on an extremely delicate subject. Sobriety and calm are particularly necessary for the development of Article 280.4. Because if we had to award a prize to the most difficult article to understand, the least clear, the most confusing, whatever name you want to give it, the competition would undoubtedly be very fierce since the Treaty is a collection of complex articles, but it goes without saying that this article is a serious candidate for this prize. It is also a particularly delicate issue because, as Mrs Theato so rightly said, it is the protection of the Community's financial interests that is at stake. We are all aware, and this Parliament was the first to be concerned, with the need to protect the Community's financial interests. But let us be careful and, as the French say: ""let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater."" In other words, in the context of protecting the Community's financial interests, we must respect not only, and Mrs Theato pointed this out, the powers of the national States, but also other points that concern citizens, that concern essential guarantees. The conclusions of the Theato report fully back them up. Therefore, as Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that tomorrow this report will enjoy the support of Parliament, by a large majority, and that it will be properly implemented by the Commission. Mr President, as Mrs Theato said, this is a critical report. It was proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report. One of the reasons why we were so keen to highlight this aspect was that the European Union, whether we like it or not, has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement, a reputation that is exaggerated, but it exists. We must do something about this situation. Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been respected by some Member States - let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing some 80% of the EU budget."	fr
I don't quite understand what the Commissioner said. At this point, the mudflat at Stregrennan, added to the Special Protection Area at the Commission's request, has been completely destroyed. It is clear that the activities that took place there are in flagrant violation of European directives. You say that there will be no further funding. I would like to know if you intend, at this point, to completely stop funding until a proper investigation takes place. If not, why not? If so, when exactly will you do so? Is it correct and appropriate that the department that owns the company is also the licensing authority and the one that, in the first place, receives EU funds and pays them to a company that it wholly owns? Is this right and appropriate? What is your opinion on this? All EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in flagrant violation of EU directives. Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a Special Protection Area has been destroyed. Compensation after the fact will not repair the damage caused. The first legal challenge followed the start of the port development work in early autumn 1999, without the compensatory habitat improvements having been implemented. As a result, the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the removal of Spartina anglica, but this time by mechanical means. The use of mechanical means brought with it an additional legal challenge—this is what I referred to in my first reply—based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the mudflats and lead to the proliferation of environmentally harmful Spartina anglica in the estuary. To date, this legal challenge has not produced any conclusive results. The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities and does not require prior approval from the Commission. The Commission's role is to ensure full compliance with the standards required by the Birds Directive, and it is clear that harmful compensatory measures in themselves would be problematic. In this case, the Commission proposes to seek further clarification from the Irish authorities on the latest situation with respect to compensatory measures and the potential problems of mechanical removal of cordgrass. At this time, we are not prepared to propose the discontinuation of structural fund funding. Mr. President, the specific case raised by Ms. McKenna is unfortunately not an isolated one. There are other examples of damage caused to the conservation of Special Scientific Areas as a result of EU funding. Will the Commission consider issuing instructions to all Member States stating that if, in the future, it discovers that European environmental directives have been breached or that adequate environmental assessments have not been carried out, it will not only stop all future funding but also withdraw funds already allocated; in other words, it will demand repayment of the sums paid to the Member States? Only such a measure will discourage this practice in the future.	fr
The right approach to the problem of speculation, in my view, is to eliminate the real causes of financial disorder, not to try to suppress only the symptoms by introducing obstacles to the functioning of the markets. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly reconstruct the procedure and ideological tactics that led to this oral question, also because I know how many Social Democrats in Parliament, and not only the experts in economic and financial policy, share our criticism. We know the problem. It is instability on the markets caused by speculation. However, those who tabled the oral question should be reminded that - as the Commissioner has explained incisively - not all instability is the result of speculation. The Tobin tax could not have prevented the EEA crises of 1992 and 1993 or the South-East Asian currency crisis of 1997. The authors of the oral question do not propose any solution, but call for a new tax, more bureaucracy and a measure that is contrary to market mechanisms. They propose an intergroup assessment in the Chamber, excluding the competent parliamentary committee, in contradiction to several decisions of Parliament. This question, I say bluntly, is in my opinion ideologically motivated and does not seek solutions. I believe this is the wrong path. Why do we reject the Tobin tax and regard it with such suspicion? Firstly, as the Commissioner has already said, because it represents a heavy burden on the capital markets. Even a minimum tax would have a heavy impact on the capital markets, since such a tax on speculation would significantly reduce the profitability of investments. Furthermore, such a measure would seriously undermine the development of financial markets, by counteracting the principle of free movement of capital which is one of the core elements of the internal market. Secondly, capital invested for speculative purposes is difficult to identify. Thirdly, fiscal measures can be easily circumvented if they are not introduced with the same system in all countries, because too many loopholes remain open. Fourthly, such a measure is difficult to apply from a technical point of view and involves a high degree of bureaucracy and administrative burdens with the impossibility of effective control. The measure we should adopt is part of the resolution under consideration today. It is about strengthening banking supervision, clarifying liability for transactions, creating a regulatory framework at international level, assessing national laws in order to verify whether they comply with the Basel Committee rules and understanding how the latter can be more widely disseminated. With regard to this resolution, I have serious doubts on a fundamental point which we cannot accept in this form. I am referring to paragraph 9. From the Commissioner's intervention we deduce that the Commission's examination will end with a rejection of the Tobin tax. If this assessment, the current debate and the arguments proposed are of the tenor that has emerged and which I share, even the fact that the Commission is dealing with it for another six months with the resulting uncertainty that will have repercussions on the financial and capital markets represents a lack of responsibility.	it
On China, we should not abandon the issue simply because discussions on the matter might be stalled. However, it is imperative that the EU speak and act together, and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen our resolve rather than weaken it. However, if the decisions that may eventually be taken in Geneva are to have full expression, then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be given the necessary resources. UN financial resources are distributed sparingly, and as a result, many vital programs rely on voluntary contributions to survive. Resources are also needed to promote practical cooperation and human rights, strategic planning, priority setting, and strengthening communications between the donor community and UN Member States. To this end, the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for US$53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks. The European Union and its Member States should take the initiative and contribute significantly to the provision of these funds. In doing so, not only would we embarrass the United States, which should assume its responsibilities with regard to the financing of the United Nations, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to the defence of human rights is more than just rhetoric. Mr President, this debate is primarily about the preparations for the upcoming annual UN Human Rights Assembly and the efforts of the Commission and the Council on this occasion. I must say first of all that I am very pleased with the contribution made so far by Mr Patten and the Minister, and I also think it is good that China and Cuba are also being discussed. Cuba remains the last dictatorship in South America and we should not forget that, despite all the sympathy that some here and there may feel for Cuba. This is a dictatorship and therefore not a democracy. In the two minutes allotted to me, I ask for your attention to focus on two countries to which I feel particularly attached. The first is Indonesia. We are obviously very pleased that Indonesia now has a new government and that Mr. Wahid and Mrs. Sukarnoputri are respectively President and Vice-President. We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction. I would like to point out, however, that in the Moluccas, an archipelago just north of Timor, the violence is still not under control. Thousands have died there over the past two years. Tens of thousands have fled. The situation is not well under control. I know that tomorrow or the day after there will be a whole programme on Dutch television devoted to this, and that people are asking there for observers to be sent to the region so that they can see exactly what is happening there, so that the facts can at least be recorded, especially for later on when human rights commissions can go there. My urgent request is this, and it is a point that has been mentioned several times in resolutions: can you not consider sending observers to the Moluccas?	fr
We make a positive overall assessment of NATO's intervention and share the view of NATO's actions. Regarding the political prisoners in Serbia, it is clear, Your Honor, that when I refer to the fact that Mr. Milosevic in that country today does not behave in accordance with the standards of a decent society on the international level, I am referring not only to what Mr. Milosevic does to his fellow citizens, but also to the situations he maintains, particularly regarding political prisoners, attacks on democratic rights, the opposition's right of access to the media, and the facilities that should be granted to non-governmental organizations to operate, particularly in the area of defending human rights. However, all this is only one of the many aspects of Mr. Milosevic's extremely pernicious actions within Yugoslav society, and the European Union naturally cannot but be concerned about this situation. For this reason, as long as Yugoslavia does not behave internationally in a way that meets the values that, in our opinion, we must defend, it will maintain all sanctions. Question No. 7 by (H-0035/00): Subject: Drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights Expressing civil society's satisfaction with the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also the hope that it will respond to the challenges facing Europe in the 21st century, the Council is asked to reply to the following: What is its opinion on the content of the Charter? Which citizens does it refer to (those of the European Union or of all European countries; will it include citizens of the enlargement and immigrants, etc.)? Will it reflect the European Union's acquis communautaire, or will it have a broader programmatic nature? What mechanisms will it use to clearly establish gender equality? What is the Council's view of incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union? I thank the President-in-Office for his presentation of the problems and for the reassurances he has given me about the progress of the work. You understand, Mr. President-in-Office, that my question is not without meaning, since the Council is a political body of the European Union, and European citizens, men and women, want to know your vision of the democratic and social model of 21st-century Europe. I would like, additionally, to ask whether the Portuguese Presidency has planned for the inclusion of children's rights, as autonomous entities, in the issues to be addressed and in the rights that will be incorporated into the Charter. As I have said, we do not control, Your Honor, the process of drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This matter is a matter for the members of that group, who will not refer it to the Council until there is consensus on the content of the Charter.	es
"In this regard, I would like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for accepting one of my amendments to add the EDF to the list of these Funds. The outermost regions, in particular the four French overseas departments, must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF so that they too can finance cooperation projects with their ACP neighbours in their respective geographical areas. I would also ask the Commission to reconsider the limited opportunities offered to the outermost and island regions on the basis of the guidelines presented in the communication. These regions must be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, like the other regions of the Union, especially since the REGIS programme intended for them has been abandoned. Finally, I would like to express my regret at the limited financial allocation for strand C, intended for interregional cooperation, whose Community added value is nevertheless undeniable. Mr President, I am speaking on the EQUAL report and on the issue of equal opportunities for men and women, although I must admit that it is sometimes cumbersome and tedious to talk about a trite and hackneyed topic like this, especially for someone my age. However, it is necessary to reiterate once again that equality does not exist. Perhaps a breakthrough in this area could lead to changes in other areas. For me, equality does not mean that the two spouses work all the time and leave the children with a babysitter, that is, an immigrant, who has not managed to find another job. That is not a big step forward compared to the times of the Sun King: no, equality means that everyone participates in family and working life. Unfortunately, trends are not going in this direction, but in the opposite direction. It therefore seems to me that point 7 contains a decidedly central element: ""The EQUAL initiative will be used as a laboratory to develop and promote new methods of implementing employment policies"". Let us hope it can work. Mr President, I would just like to say, for the record, that if I am not in the Chamber when the Committee responds - not that I have asked specific questions, but I hope that the Committee has listened to my speech - it will be because at the same time as the debate in the Chamber there is a meeting of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities on the issue of women in decision-making. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who deal with rural areas know that the LEADER programmes, both LEADER I and LEADER II - and I hope the same will also be true for LEADER+ - are among the flattering results achieved by the European Union with its programmes. This success is also due to the strong participation that the basic concept of the LEADER programmes has aroused among the population involved in the activities. I am pleased that this same approach has also been followed for LEADER+. However, there is one problem that we must address together. Since LEADER acts as a laboratory, with a bottom-up approach, an extraordinary number of ideas have developed in recent years within LEADER I and II which, of course, in the long run no longer turn out to be so new or particularly effective."	it
"Reconciling the two objectives is not easy. It does not happen automatically. There may be certain contradictions between the two, and there is no indication that the Commission has identified these contradictions or suggested ways of overcoming them. As for the other side of the agenda, Mr President of the Commission, namely cohesion and regional development, we have certainly made considerable achievements in this area. However, there are also lagging regions, particularly island regions, to which more attention should be paid. With regard to fisheries, there is nothing in your programme to suggest that any lessons for the future have been learned from the devastating overfishing that has led to the disappearance of entire species. In these matters, perhaps greater vigilance and more esprit de finesse are needed. Madam President, first of all, I would like to reiterate the cautionary words expressed by many of my colleagues with regard to this five-year programme. Despite ambitious long-term goals, we must not lose sight of the present. The leader of my group, Mr. Poettering, emphasized this very emphatically in his opening speech. The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without having a successful European economy as a basic prerequisite. This prerequisite is clearly the internal market. And what is the current state of development of the internal market? I would like to remind Mr. Prodi and his colleagues, who are still here, of the results of the Commission's own study of 3,000 European companies. Almost 40% of them state that measures to comply with national regulations for their products and services entail additional costs for them. This is what the Commission itself stated in its study. These are classic symptoms of the continued obstruction by national governments – bureaucracy that prevents market entry. The Commission's program displays a worrying complacency when it comes to completing the internal market. We must work persistently to remove further barriers in all areas, increase pressure on Member States that are failing to implement the necessary measures to complete the internal market, and include crucial new areas such as financial services. Only with an internal market as a solid foundation can we successfully enlarge the Union. An enlarged Europe must build on the Union's existing strengths. Extending the internal market to an enlarged Union should be an achievement of tremendous proportions. Finally, on behalf of all my Conservative colleagues—and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament—let me assure you that we will fully support the Commission and Mr Prodi in carrying out this historic task. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, Commissioners, dear colleagues, Let me begin with a quote: ""The Commission will continue the preparatory work on a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and will put forward proposals for the implementation of an ambitious program. In particular, the Commission will propose the development of a genuine European asylum and immigration policy, and it advocates strengthening mutual legal assistance and judicial cooperation and developing an effective approach to combating all forms of crime."" That is the entire program for the next five years on internal security, freedoms, citizens' rights, and judicial cooperation."	de
Its funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighborhoods in the United Kingdom, Moss Side. The Millennium Youth Park project is helping young people reengage in the rehabilitation of their own community, and in addition to helping small businesses and supporting social policy, we are beginning to see the restoration of a very depressed urban community. The activities carried out within the framework of the URBAN initiative have been raised among the general public through an active advertising campaign in local supermarkets and well-known British pubs. This is the kind of good practice that should be replicated throughout the EU in terms of communication and advertising. The specific guidelines governing this initiative have been broadly defined to accommodate local and regional diversity. We agree that they should be indicative in nature, allowing maximum flexibility to ensure we focus on specific programs. In committee, we do not favor reducing their number to 50. We support an overall reduction, but we believe that the arbitrary figure of 50 is not the key factor. Instead, we should focus on high-quality projects that act as a catalyst for change and renewal, attract inward investment in the form of loans and venture capital, and achieve a multiplier effect. Member States should be able to propose a reasonable number of measures that do not exceed the financial limits of their allocations. We need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and hygiene when designating local URBAN programs so that we can effectively focus on the most affected areas. The UK's Local Deprivation Index is a very good example of a statistic and a widely used criterion that contributes to establishing not only EU aid programs, but also regional and national ones. We should recognize this index as an instrument and resource to complement EU criteria. I urge you to take ownership of local indicators to achieve this. The most deprived urban neighborhoods face numerous problems: high unemployment rates, precarious and often poorly paid employment, poverty, and social exclusion. Lack of hygiene, poor housing, and an environment of drug addiction often exacerbate these problems. As a result, unstable communities emerge, where crime, drug trafficking, and gangs eventually infiltrate. Many urban areas know this all too well. These complex problems worsen the quality of life of urban residents, even though these areas have the potential to create growth and prosperity. This is why I call in my report for the measures included in the URBAN programme to go beyond providing a single solution to a single problem: these areas do not have individual problems. We should encourage communities in urban areas to submit integrated action plans to address their specific urban problems, using EU resources as an added value to local measures. I would like to see these measures also include improving hygiene and combating discrimination, as mandated by the Amsterdam Treaty.	es
"As we sit here, hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous danger from flooding in Mozambique. This did not just happen. The flooding has been going on for weeks, yet only now does the need appear to be being assessed. The level of practical assistance from the Community and Member States has been pathetic. For a long time, many of us have warned that the European Union was spending far too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision-making structures. It should have concentrated instead on improving its civilian instruments, particularly those for humanitarian intervention. I acknowledge Mr. Patten's efforts in this direction, but what a pity that Member State governments have not spent as much time defining their capacity to provide disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they are spending on the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine NATO's capabilities. Of course, there is a link between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries. They are not new, but NATO is already addressing them. I have not yet heard a convincing security policy explanation as to why the European Union needs to define autonomous decision-making capabilities for use by military forces outside NATO structures, unless it is to create bodies that will compete with NATO. After all, EU member states are either full members of NATO or they sit at the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. NATO is largely European. Finally, Mr. Solana, I would just like to ask you what the point is of having the much-heralded political planning and early warning cell within the Council Secretariat if we are surprised by yet another humanitarian catastrophe. Mr President, Mr High Representative, Mr Commissioner, regarding the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general, and of the European Union in particular. However, what happened, and what is still happening in Chechnya, amounts to genocide. How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400,000 inhabitants, the incessant and disproportionate bombardment of towns, villages, and neighborhoods, where the entire civilian population may have been mixed with a few Chechen fighters? How can we describe the sinister filtration camps, comparable to concentration camps, in which the population suffers the worst humiliations and from which able-bodied men aged 15 to 65 rarely emerge alive? How can we describe the rapes, looting, arson, and deportations, known as ""cleansing,"" which recall the worst episodes of the European Middle Ages? And what about the blanket of silence that has fallen over Russian and international journalists, and the banishment of humanitarian organizations and any international commission of inquiry into the sites of the massacres?"	fr
"Social policy coordination and dialogue are good things, but we must avoid tarring everyone with the same brush; we must maintain a plurality of solutions. Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the strategy outlined here, concerning the modernization of social security, I would nevertheless like to raise a few points, some positive and others in the form of a question. I find the movement that is slowly but surely spreading to the dossier to be positive. This seems good to me. It also seems useful to me. I also find the broad outlines of the communication concerning the strategic approach to be positive. We also hope that the four objectives mentioned therein can be achieved in a reasonable manner. We would also like to emphasize the interest in the way in which this dossier has been approached, on the one hand through the ""Luxembourg-style"" process, the guidelines, but we also believe that the interest lies in the fact that, as Mrs Van Lancker has already pointed out, directives are being put forward with regard to atypical work, self-employed workers without employees, etc. However, we foresee two problems for which solutions will have to be found. The first is that we are talking about downward adjustment of social security, where we are hoping for convergence at the same level. I would like to give some examples here from the survey recently conducted by the Dutch professional movement on social security reforms within the European Union. It emerges from this study that adjustments are taking place everywhere, but that many of these adjustments, even the majority, turn out to be downward adjustments, the rest being improvements. The vast majority of these adjustments are focused on pensions; there are eleven limitations and two improvements. For unemployment benefits, we see six limitations and five improvements. The reasons for these adjustments are, for example, the improvement of working conditions, the reduction of social security expenditure, but also policy competition and the EMU criteria. This policy competition is mainly found in the Nordic countries. The greatest stability and even improvements in social security are concentrated in the southern countries. All in all, we also observe a limited role for the social partners in this entire process. This does not seem very positive and means that the convergence strategy must be geared towards the best approaches. If I may put it this way, we do not always enjoy a cappuccino. Mr. President, I, in turn, would like to congratulate the Commission and the rapporteur. The committee because it has taken a further step towards convergence in social security, and the rapporteur for the quality of the report he has submitted. European Union policy includes, in addition to economic and employment policy, also a social policy. To date, however, this has remained limited in both intentions and means. But under the influence of the free movement of workers, the internal market, and the euro, labor markets are also integrating."	fr
Thanks to the principle of partnership and parity, as well as parliamentary assistance through the Joint Assembly, this is a global model. It is good that in this jubilee year, which also allows us to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the cooperation initiated by the Lomé Convention, we are about to witness the conclusion of a new partnership agreement which also enhances the role of the Joint Assembly, transformed into a genuine parliamentary assembly, both for the EU and the ACP. In this retrospective, I would therefore like not to limit myself to the year 1999. Indeed, my colleague Corrie has already alluded to it admirably. Most of the things that affect us today are the result of fundamental transformations observed since the end of the 1980s in most parts of the world. This process of transformation has also led to extremely violent upheavals in developing countries. They continue to feel the side effects today. ACP cooperation is a dynamic process. From Lomé I to Lomé VI, there has been clear progress in the successive contents of the agreement. At the same time, the number of partner states has increased significantly and now stands at 71. Particularly noteworthy is the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa, which has greatly affected all those who took part. Now Cuba is knocking at the door. If this country is accepted into the ACP-EU Community, this will constitute a significant step forward that will inevitably initiate a process of change in Cuba itself. ACP cooperation therefore remains of great interest, and not only because of the new emphases contained in the agreement. The fight against poverty and support for sustainable economic, social and cultural development are important objectives with a view to building democratic societies in the ACP countries that respect human rights. This includes, in particular, strengthening democratic institutions. In this regard, the history of the Joint Assembly impressively attests to a positive development. While the people who once represented ACP countries at the negotiating table were mainly members of government, civil servants, or ambassadors, today almost three-quarters of our interlocutors are elected members of a parliamentary assembly. If this representation by parliamentarians were soon to be increased to 100%, as the new agreement calls for, we should celebrate the event. Unfortunately, the ongoing democratization processes go much less unnoticed than the various crises that arise in these countries. Therefore, they receive much less attention. Regional cooperation or integration is a specialty of ACP multilateral cooperation. One of the wishes included in the long list of expectations of the European Parliament will finally be realized. Soon, the Joint Assembly will also be able to hold regional meetings. We have already heard about this. Strengthened regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of ethnic, economic, social or religious conflicts and thus have a preventive effect. For the same reason, the European Parliament has always spoken out in favour of civil society participation in the decision-making process and the management of cooperation and has always stressed the importance of decentralised cooperation. The strengthening of contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners, as provided for in the new agreement, is once again a step in the right direction. However, there remains one small drawback: the European Development Fund is still not integrated into the European budget.	fr
"Madam Deputy, I recognize that all the efforts made in Kosovo in this area are insufficient. I don't think anyone has the slightest doubt about that. I do not want to link this issue to the comments I made about the period ""before"" and ""after"" NATO's intervention; we will probably return to this point at another point during Question Time. However, I would like to tell you that the European Union is aware that the financial resources channeled to Kosovo correspond to what was possible, to the extent possible. We must understand that our responsibility in this region is a responsibility shared with the international community. It is a responsibility in which the European Union has a determined role, but we cannot claim to quickly rebuild structures that were already not in the best condition before the military action in Kosovo, as you rightly pointed out. Moreover, it does not seem to me, Madam, that the military actions in Kosovo contributed to such significant destruction of health structures, which have a direct effect on the current situation. The current situation is essentially linked to the dramatic situation regarding displaced populations, it is linked to a set of economic factors and the level of satisfaction of basic health needs resulting from the general decay of the organizational structure of the Kosovo administration. This is the basic question underlying the entire current situation. There will be no solution to the problem of children's health, nor to other development problems in the region, until we resolve the political problem, which must be done within the framework of a United Nations resolution. I would like to broaden the debate a little by mentioning the situation in Mitrovica. The international community has rebuilt the hospital there with European assistance, but the building is located in the northern part of the city, which makes access to it problematic for Kosovar Albanians. This means that Kosovar Albanians continue to be deprived of medical care. This situation is repeated in other parts of the country, causing tensions between Kosovar Albanians and Serbs, with mistrust between the populations being general, with some not wanting to be treated by others and vice versa. I understand that you say, and you are right to say so, that the European Union must work within the framework of a broader international cooperation association. But what lever will you use to change the situation? What will you do to ensure that Kosovar Albanians can also receive treatment in a hospital, particularly in Mitrovica? Mr. Deputy, the issue of Mitrovica is well known. It is a very specific situation, where inter-ethnic tension has reached a level of seriousness that is fortunately absent in other areas of Kosovo. I fully understand your concern. I would like to tell you, however, that Mr. Bernard Kouchner acted along a line that aims to preserve what underlies the United Nations resolution on the matter, in an attempt to create the conditions for multi-ethnic structures that can serve the different communities, including at the level of the different dimensions of the administration."	fr
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I would like to thank you for your speech, especially Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share. Therefore, I will not repeat anything he said. I would simply like to make three observations, which Commissioner Patten may perhaps see in a similar light, but which, for various reasons, cannot be expressed as openly as they would by a Member of Parliament. First, I believe that we can be pleased about the agreements that exist between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. But we now have enough agreements: Oslo, Wye Plantation, Sharm-el-Sheik. That is enough; they only need to be implemented. However, I share the scepticism of my colleague, Mr Salafranca, when he says that there was bad news from Israel this week, namely that this latest agreement cannot be implemented on time. The second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel. I consider this very encouraging news. But we also learned this week that Mr. Barak is not going to Washington, and therefore the negotiations cannot continue. I want to state quite clearly: If the Golan Heights are returned to Syria, the problem in this region will be solved. Regarding the question of the referendum, which several colleagues have raised: We must consider whether a referendum is always necessary to fulfill obligations under international law! In Germany, people would probably be very pleased if we said we would hold a referendum on payments to the European Union, and we would make it dependent on whether the German people are willing to pay. That would be a similar situation. Third and final point: the role of the European Union. I really want to emphasize the outstanding role Special Envoy Moratino has played in the region, and also the funding we have provided there, Commissioner Patten. You know that you will always find support in this Parliament, including for your proposal. We will be there if it is to be funded. But we also have a political role to play, and Mr. Moratinos cannot play that role alone in this region. The Council Presidency must take action; Mr. CFSP must travel to the region, and we must invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves, as the Russians did. Then we will have played a role commensurate with our participation and our contribution. Mr. President, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, the peace talks that recently began in the United States between Israel and Syria represent a turning point in the history of the Middle East, one we have been waiting for for 50 years and one that will certainly be difficult to overcome. There will be no meeting in Shepherdstown today, but we can hope, as Commissioner Patten said earlier, that this postponement of negotiations due to the latest Syrian demands is merely a minor setback on the road to a peace agreement that will profoundly change the entire Middle East. This is precisely the content of our resolution: the hope for a fair and balanced agreement, based on the preservation of sovereignty and the right to live in security within secure and recognized borders.	de
Competition must bring supply and demand into balance, creating an optimal distribution of resources and economic factors. But optimal efficiency does not necessarily come about by itself. In order to prevent abuse, framework conditions are needed, such as competition rules. This essentially only prevents abuse, but competition alone cannot achieve socially legitimate objectives. Yes to competition; reduce aid where necessary and possible! And precisely because aid occupies a large part of the 1998 Competition Report, even though there is the report by my colleague Jonckheer, I still want to speak on this issue: it is certainly possible and must also be permissible to grant aid to small and medium-sized enterprises active in research and development, in training, in regional policy, in environmental policy. Aid must be permitted for these objectives, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortions of competition. And it is precisely here, even more than in the law on cartels and mergers, that it is particularly important to make reasonable decisions. Aid should therefore not be demonised, it should be considered in a differentiated manner, and it should also be assessed on the basis of its contribution to achieving the objectives mentioned. This last observation was not so much addressed to the Commission as to my fellow Members of the PPE Group. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report I am about to present to you is an opinion on the Commission's annual report on state aid in force in the European Union, for which the Community is competent under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties. The Commission's report is essentially descriptive and illustrates the evolution of state aid in the manufacturing sector and in other sectors, according to different typologies, as well as the methods of financing and the objectives pursued. As regards the quantitative aspects of the report, I would refer to the explanatory memorandum and would simply point out that, on average, the annual amount for the period in question amounts to EUR 95 billion, a decrease of around 13% compared with the period 1993-1995. This decrease is essentially the result of the reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany. In short, the declared level of state aid is on average more or less stable over the period in question, standing at around 1.2 percent of Community GDP, roughly equivalent, and this is a coincidence, to the annual budget of the Community. That said, the differences between Member States are high and can be measured in different ways, notably as a percentage of added value or per employee. I also think it is interesting to add state aid to Community interventions which can in a certain sense be assimilated to state aid. It will then be clearly noted that at the top are the four countries which are beneficiaries, among other things, of the Cohesion Fund. I now come to the propositional part of the report. First of all, we note that according to the Commission, the data, as presented in the Commission's annual report, are too aggregated to allow an in-depth assessment of state aid policy, a legitimate situation but delicate from the point of view of national interests and undoubtedly important with regard to compliance with competition, also in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty.	it
We always come back to the same fundamental problem of Europe: our economic life is not dynamic enough and it does not sufficiently encourage individual initiative. The economy must be strong so that we can take care of our loved ones and the environment. This is not politics, but simple life logic. As for the use of credits now, it is positive that they are centralized because scattering them will eventually evaporate them. Now we must concentrate our efforts on solving the problems of large and medium-sized cities since they do not have enough critical mass. We will also be able to give additional impetus to the surrounding rural areas. We often forget that the problems of the cities and those of the countryside actually go hand in hand. Everything is based on encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship because the mobilization of the masses, which begins with individuals, leads to an internal renewal of the area. Granting credits without a healthy and independent economy would be like pouring water into a well: there will be enough to drink for a while, but the next day the well will be empty again. Mr. President, with the implementation of Interreg III, European cooperation policy is entering a new phase. Internal borders are no longer the only focus of our concerns; external borders are too. In the context of globalization and the cultural openness that characterizes the current situation, the European Union needs instruments that will enable it to strengthen its links and channels of communication with neighboring regions, particularly eastern and southern Europe. The Union's borders must no longer constitute an obstacle to balanced development, but - on the contrary - an opportunity, a bridge to make cooperation more fruitful. With the amendments approved in committee, Parliament has attempted to complement the Commission's work by introducing new elements into the list of aid recipient areas, particularly for the external and maritime borders of southern Europe. In its draft guidelines, the Commission recognizes that these borders require more attention than in the past. This is due to the process of enlargement to the east and the process of closer integration with the countries of the Mediterranean basin. As President Prodi pointed out when he outlined the strategic objectives for 2000-2005, the revival of the Barcelona Process is a priority for the Union, and the Interreg III initiative can contribute to the pursuit of this strategic objective. While we welcome the excellent work accomplished by the rapporteur, we only hope that the Commission will take due account of the proposals put forward by Parliament, thus respecting the commitments made in the framework of the code of conduct for the implementation of structural policies, and that it will confirm, through the necessary amendments, the conversion of this Community initiative so that it is no longer simply an instrument of internal redistribution but constitutes an opportunity to revive and enhance relations with neighboring countries. Mr President, since this year, the Structural Funds have been allocated a sum of around 200 billion euros until 2006. Only 5.75% of this sum is reserved for the Community initiatives Interreg, Leader, Urban and Equal.	fr
